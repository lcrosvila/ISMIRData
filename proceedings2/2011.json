INTRODUCTION  \nMusic Information Retrieval (MIR) has grown in many fields \nbut, there is still a significant gap between western and non -\nwestern, especially mid dle-eastern, MIR. As me ntioned by \nDownie et al. [15], it is  one of the most important challenges  \nfor the second decade of International Society of Musi c \nInformation Retrieval (ISMIR) to expand  its musical \nhorizons to non ‚Äìwestern music. To reduce this gap, we \ndevelop a system for Iranian traditional musical Dastgah \nclassification.  \nThe Dastgah concept in Persian music is similar to \nwestern musical scales and Maqams in Turkish and Arabic \nmusic. Middle -eastern music has not been considered in MIR \nstudies l argel y, however, Gedik et al. [10] constructed a \nTurkish music Maqam recognition system based on the \nsimilarity between pitch histograms ; and Heydarian et al.  \n[16] described the Ir anian musical Santur instrumen t and  \nthey also implemented  an algorithm for the calculation of  \nfundamental frequency . \nIn this paper , we introduce a Dastgah recognition system \nbased on the similarity between Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Sets \n(IT2FS s). Fuzzy logic is also used by Bosteels  et al.  [17] for \ndefining dynamic playlist  generation heuristics . Sanghoon  et \nal. [18] also used fuzzy logic in a music emotion recognition \nsystem.  Leon et al.  [19] also modeled musical n otes by fuzzy logic to integrate  music  tuning  theory and practice . \nAfter feature extraction , the proposed  system  assumes \neach performed note as an IT2FS , so each musical piece is a \nset of  IT2FSs.The maximum similarity between this set and \ntheoreti cal Dastgah prototypes,  which are also sets of \nIT2FSs, indicates the desirable Dastgah.  Gedik et al.  [10] \nused the songs of the datase t to construct the patterns, \nwhereas  in this study , the system makes no assumption about \nthe data except  that different Dastgahs have different  pitch \nintervals. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the \nsystem . We also show that the system can recognize  the \nDastgah of the songs of the proposed dataset  with overall \naccuracy of 85% . \n \nFigure 1.  Dastgah classification system . \n2. IRANIAN TRADITIONAL MUSIC  \nPersian music is a very old eastern music and has had \noutstanding impacts on other eastern musical cultures like  \nCentral Asia, Northern Africa, Southern Europe and  also the \ncountries around the Persian Gulf.  \nIranian traditional music intervals consist of 2 4 equal \nQuartertones per each octave. This division first suggested by \nVaziri [1]. H e called half -sharp quartertone  Sori and half -flat \nquartertone Koron. In practice,  Sori and Koron are not \nexactly half -sharp o r half -flat and can reside anywhere  \nbetween tw o semitones . \nPersian music is based on  a set of seven major Dastgahs: \nShur, Segah, Chahargah, Homayun, Ma hur, Nava and Rast -\npanjgah. The Dastgah  in Persian  music  is similar to the \nwestern musical scale s (major and minor) and  also Maqams \nin Turkish and Arab ic music. Like western musical  scales , \nDastgah  represents a specific pattern of the pitch ratios of \nPitch estimation\n(SWIPE)Note Segmentation\n(Subtractive Clust .)Pitch/ Unpitched\nDetection \nFolding Notes\nIn One OctavePost-Clustering\n(Mahal .

Each Dastgah  consist s of some partial \nmelodies, called Gushe , which  are created according to \nDastgah patterns ; however, some of them  are not compatible  \nto those patterns ; therefore,  their tuning might  be different  \nsince  they are used for moving from  one Dastgah to another \none ( modulation) or  for making the performance more \npleasant , like Salmak  Gushe in Shur  Dastgah.  \nThe arrangement of Gush es in each D astgah during the \nperformance is known as Radif  which is  presented by the \nmasters of Persian  music ; such as Mahmud karimi‚Äôs  Radif \nfor vocal or Mirza -abdollah‚Äôs Radif for fret instrument s. \nFor representing each Dastgah, w e prefer the cent scale to \ntempered western intervals (note, half note, etc.) . As it is \nmentioned, Sori and Korons can be resided anywhere \nbetween two half notes. Better results will be obtained if the \ncent scale is used rather than dividing the octave into equal \ndivisions (12,  24 etc.).  The scale steps of each D astgah \naccording to Karimi‚Äôs  Radif and Farhat [2] is shown in Table \n1. Dastgahs like Mahur and Rast -panjgah, and also Nava and \nShur have the same tuning.  \nTable 1 .

PITCH DETECTION  \nThe proposed model for Iranian traditional music Dastgah  \nrecognition must be applicable  on new and old songs. The \nmajority of available old songs are convert ed to digital form \nfrom tape, so  the white noise is an inseparable part of them , \nand we need a system to discriminate pitch form unpitched \nsignals.  \nIn order to do this, SWIPE ' algorithm  [3] is used which \ncan estimate the pitch and its strength at (discrete) time ùëõ as \nthe spectral similarity between the signal (in the proximity of \nùëõ) and a sawtooth waveform with missing non -prime \nharmonics and same ( estimated)  pitch as the signal. The  \npitch vector is refined and classified to pitch/unpitched \nclusters using the method was presented by Camachao   [4]. It \ntrack s the pitch strength t race of the signal and searches  for \nclusters of pitch and unpitched sound according to the local \nmaximization of the distance between the centroids.  \nThe result of using SWIPE ' is shown in Figure 2 . The \npitches are retrieved from the vocal of Mahmud Karimi in \nShur  Dastgah.  The system estimates the pitch of the signal at \neach 45 millisecond . The bold black circles are the pitch \ncluster  centers  which will be described in S ection  4.1. \nPersian music is a center orient ed music, as it shown in \nFigure 2 the vocalist s tarts with the Shahed (tonic) note,  here \nabout 180 Hz, and circulates around it during the \nperformance and again backs to it .  \nFigure 2. The pitches of vocal of Karimi in Shur mode.  \nCircles  are the pitches and  the bold black circles are the pitch \ncluster centers.  \n4. PREPROCESSING  \n4.1 Note Segmentation  \nFirst of all our system needs to recogni ze which musical \nnotes are  used during the performance; moreover, it is \nneeded to eliminate the wrong estimated pi tches. A special \nsituation may o ccur when we use vocal as our raw d ata. As it \nis shown  in Figure 2 at the beginning of each note, it takes \nsome milliseconds that the vocalist achieves the desirable \nfrequency of voice and also at the end of each note we have \nsome ir relevant p oints. To omit  the redundant points , we \nneed to use a clustering method to discriminate the not es \nform irrelevant data. Subtractive Clustering [5]  is used . \nThis algorithm uses the data points , in time -frequency \nscale,  as candidates for the center s of the clusters . Also, t he \nnumber of clusters is not needed to be predefined. Since each \npoint of data ( ùëãùëñ) is a candidate of clusters centers, a function \nfor measuring the density in  ùëãùëñ  is defined as  \nùê∑ùëñ= ùëíùë•ùëù ‚àí ùëãùëñ‚àíùëãùëó 2\nùëüùëé2 2 ùëõ\nùëó=1 ,                       (1) \nWhere ùëüùëé is a positive constant repre senting a neighborhood \nradius, t hus a data point with many neighboring data points \nwill have a high potential value.  After computing the \npotential value of every data point, we select the da ta point \nwith the highest potential value as the cluster center. Let ùëãùëê1 \nto be the location of the first cluster center, then the potential \nof each data point ( ùëãùëñ) will be revised as  \nùê∑ùëñ=ùê∑ùëñ‚àíùê∑ùëê1ùëíùë•ùëù ‚àí ùëãùëñ‚àíùëãùëê1 2\nùëüùëè2 2 ,                   (2) \nWhere  ùê∑ùëñ and ùê∑ùëê1 is the potential value of  ùëãùëñ and the first \ncluster center, respectively and ùëüùëè is a positive constant \nwhich defines a neighborhood that has measurable reductions \nin density measure (typically  ùëüùëè=1.5ùëüùëé). Thus we subtract \nthe amount of potential value of each data point as a function \nof its distance from the first cluster center.  After revising the \ndensity function, the next cluster center is selected as the \npoint having the greatest density value. This process \ncontinues until ùê∑ùëò<ùúÄùê∑ùëê1 at the ùëòth iteration, where Œµ is a \nsmall fraction.  An algorithm is presented  by Chiu  [5] for \nfinding the suitable amount of ùúÄ. Figure  2 shows the \nextracted  pitch cluster centers . Note that, e ach pitch cluster \n27612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncenter has two features (Time and Pitch). However, the pitch \nfeature of each cluster center will be used in the next steps.  \n4.2 Folding Notes  \nIt is convenient to fold all the extracted notes in one octave \nbecause the process of classification will be easier if we deal \nwith one octave. The distance between A3 to A4 (220 Hz to \n440 Hz ) is selected. We fold the note  ùëìùëñ in the propose d \noctave  by \nùêπùêø ùëìùëñ =\n     ùëìùëñ\n2ùëêùëíùëñùëô ùëôùëúùëî2ùëìùëñ\n440 ,           ùëìùëñ>440   \nùëìùëñ‚àó2ùëêùëíùëñùëô ùëôùëúùëî2220\nùëìùëñ ,        ùëìùëñ<220\nùëìùëñ ,                        ùëúùë°ùëïùëíùëüùë§ùëñùë†ùëí   .             (3) \nAfter that, all the notes will be translated into cents with \nrespect to 220  Hz. In order of brevity, it is not included here.  \n4.3 Post-Clustering  \nAfter folding notes in one octave , Mahalanobis distance  [6] \nis applied  to recognize which point on the reference octave \ncorresponds to each musical note.  Little et al. [7] also used \nthis method for note segmentation of a query by humming \nsystem.  \nWe find the distance between adjacent frames in the \nsequence using the Mahalanobis distance measure, Shown in \nEq. ( 4). Given a frame ùëùùëñ, we assume a new note has begun \nwherever  the distance between two adjacent frames ùëùùëñ and \nùëùùëñ+1 exceeds a threshold, T  \n (ùëùùëñ‚àíùëùùëñ+1)ùëÄ‚àí1(ùëùùëñ‚àíùëùùëñ+1),2>T ‚Üí new note       (4) \nWhere the matrix ùëÄ is a covaria nce matrix, which calculated \nfrom the variance within a rectangular window around the \nframe ùëùùëñ as \nùëÄ ùëù,ùëù =1\n2ùúè  ùëùùëò‚àíùëù  ùëùùëò‚àíùëù ùëñ+ùúè\nùëò=ùëñ‚àíùúè ,                (5) \nWhere ùúè is the size of a window surrounding the current \nframe and the average for ùëù, ùëù are calculated over this \nwindow.  \nThe amount of T is set  according to the quarter notes of  \nPersian music, about 0.22, and a small window size for \ncalculating the matrix ùëÄ(ùúè=4 frames)  is used . The result of \nthis process is shown in Figure 3 which the performed notes \nof Hoseyni  Gusheh in Shur mode base d on Karimi‚Äôs  vocal \nare classified. The green thick lines and dashed red lines are \nthe begi nning and the end of each note, respectively.  \n \nFigure 3.  Clustering notes within one octave . 5. FUZZY LOGIC TYPE 2 A S DASTGAH \nCLASSIFIER  \n5.1 Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Sets  \nType -2 fuzzy logic  is an extension of type -1 fuzzy logic  that \nfirst was introduced by Zadeh  [8]. It can describe the \nuncertainty associated with our data when it is vague or \nincomplete, effectively. A  special kind of t ype-2 fuzz y set , \nIT2FS,  is used  as the basic element of the  classifier.  IT2FSs \ninclude a secondary membership function to model the \nuncertainty of exact (crisp) type-1 fuzzy sets .1 \nAn IT2FS in the universal set ùëã, denoted as ùê¥ , can be \nexpressed as     \nùê¥ = ùúáùê¥ ùë•‚ààùëã(ùë•)/ùë•=   ùëìùë•(ùë¢)/ùë¢ùë•‚ààùêΩùë• /ùë•‚ààùëãùë•ùêΩùë•‚äÜ 0,1 , (6) \nWhere ùëìùë•(ùë¢) is the secondary membership function and ùêΩùë• is \nthe primary membership of ùë• which is the domain of the \nsecondary membership function [9].  Figure 4 shows this \nregion. The shaded region bounded by an upper and lower \nmembership function is called the footprint of uncertainty \n(FOU). The FOU of ùê¥  can be expressed by the union of all \nthe primary memberships as  \nùêπùëÇùëà ùê¥  = ùêΩùë•‚àÄùë•‚ààùëã =  ùë•,ùë¢ :ùë¢‚ààùêΩùë•‚äÜ 0,1  ,       (7) \nThe upper membership function (UMF) and lower \nmembership function (LMF) of ùê¥  are two type -1 Fuzzy \nMembership f unctions that bound the FOU. The UMF \ndenoted by ùúá ùê¥  ùë•  is associated with the upper bound of \nFOU, and the LMF denoted by ùúáùê¥  ùë•  is associated  with the \nlower bound of FOU. They can be represented as  \nùúá ùê¥ (ùë•)‚â°ùêπùëÇùëà(ùê¥ )           ‚àÄùë•‚ààùëã,                         (8) \nùúáùê¥ (ùë•)‚â°ùêπùëÇùëà(ùê¥ )‚àÄùë•‚ààùëã.                         (9) \n \nFigure 4.  An Interval Type 2 Fuzzy set.  \n5.2 Fuzzifiers  \n5.2.1 Theoretical Data and the Data From Signal  \nWe must manage the uncertainty  associated  with both each \nperformed note and eac h note of the theoretical data . First;  \nwe must define a boundary for each note . We find it \n                                                           \n1The membership value for ordinary fuzzy sets is a crisp number in  [0,1] . \n0 2 4 6 8 1000.20.40.60.81\nXPrimary Membership\nxj\n)(~xAÔÅ≠\n)(~xAÔÅ≠\n277Poster Session 2\nconvenient to use a region of about 67 cent s for each note. \nGedik  et al. [10] also used this region for the width s of \nGaussians  of theoretical  patterns  for Turkish Maqams . \nThe mean of each segment , which  are received from  the \npost-clustering phase,  is considered  as a reference.  Then,  the \nupper bound ùúìùëò and the lower bound ùúôùëò of ùëòth frame in 67 \ncent scale  are computed as  \nùúìùëò=ùëöùëñùëõ((ùúéùëò+33.96),1200 ),                   (10)  \nùúôùëò=ùëöùëéùë•  ùúéùëò‚àí33.96 ,1 ,                      (11)  \nùúéùëò=ùëàùëò‚àíùêøùëò\n2+ùêøùëò,                               (12)  \nWhere ùëàùëò and  ùêøùëò are the beginning and the end of the ùëòth \nsegment, respectively. \n5.2.2 Fuzzifing Upper and Lower Bounds  \nThe upper and lower bounds of each note  must be fuzzified \nin a [0, 1] scale with a membership function.  Considering one \noctave,  there  is a non -linier relation between the cent degree \nand frequency of each note that can be expressed as  \n ùëì ùë• =ùêµ‚àó2ùë•‚àí1200\n1200 ,                          (13) \nWhere ùë• is the degree of cent  of any note and ùêµ is the \nfrequency of the final note of the proposed octave (e.g. 440 \nHz). If we assign the membership value  zero and one to the \nfirst and the last note,  respectively Eq. ( 13) is rewritten  as \nùëì ùë• = ùê¥‚àó2 ‚àó2ùë•‚àí1200\n1200\nùê¥‚àí1,                     (14) \nWhere ùê¥ is the  frequency of the first note of the proposed \noctave (e.g. 220 Hz).  After simplification, Eq. ( 14) can be \nrewritten  as \nùëì ùúì =2ùúì\n1200‚àí1,                           (15) \nùëì ùúô =2ùúô\n1200‚àí1.                           (16) \nWhere  ùúì and ùúô are the upper and lower bound s of any note, \nrespectively.  Both Eq. ( 15) and Eq. ( 16) can be considered as \nsuitable type -1 fuzzy membership functions for fuzzifing \nmusical notes . We call them Musical Fuzzy Membership \nFunctions (MFMF).   \n5.2.3 Creating Footprint of Uncertainty  \nTwo Gaussians  are used  for creating FOU s. Kreinovich  et al.  \n[11] also prove that  Gaussian membership functions are the \nbest choice for representing uncertainty in measurement.  The \nconstructed Gaussians  are also mapped  on MFMF to obtain \nmore  similarity degree  between  overlapped  IT2FSs . \nThe UMF and LMF of the FOU  for a note with a domain \nfrom ùúô to ùúì are constructed as  \nùúá ùê¥  ùë•,ùúì = ùëí‚àí ùë•‚àíùëê 2\n2ùúé12\nùëãùëëùë•‚àóùëì ùúì ,                        (17) \nùúáùê¥ (ùë•,ùúô)= ùëí‚àí ùë•‚àíùëê 2\n2ùúé22\nùëãùëëùë•‚àóùëì(ùúô).                        (18) Where ùëã=[ùúô,ùúì], ùëê is the center of the [ùúô,ùúì]  boundary \nand ùúé12and ùúé22 are the standard deviation s and ùëì(ùúì) and \nùëì(ùúô) are the fuzzification functions for fuzzifing the upper \nand lower bounds of each note  with MFMF , respectively . \nThe pattern of S hur and Nava scale is shown in Figure  5. \n \nFigure  5. Shur  Dastgah  prototype that consists  of seven \nIT2FSs  which  are mapped on MFMF (dashed line).  \n5.3 Fuzzy Similarity Measure  \nA suitable Fuzzy Similarity Measure (FSM)  is used  for \ncomputing the degree of similarity between prototypes and \nunknown patterns.  \nBasically, a robust FSM must satisfies four properties \nsuch as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity and overlapping \n[13]. There are only six methods for computing the similarity \nbetween IT2FSs.  Wu et al. [13] evaluated  the six m ethods . \nWu et al.  [13] defined a new FSM,  called Jaccard similarity \nmeasure (JSM) , which  satisfies the  mentioned properties.  It \nis also the fastest algorithm  among the other FSMs [ 9].

This \nassignment helps  to establish  more discrimination between \nDastgahs . It also indicates  the degree of  the uniqueness of \neach specific note. A constant weight (0.10)  is assigned  to \nthe seventh and common note of each Dastgah. The assigned \nweight to each note is shown in Tabl e 2. \n5.5 Fuzzy Weighted Average  \nFuzzy Weighted Average (FWA) is  computed by Eq. ( 21). \nMendel  et al. [9] discussed about five different situations of \nthe variables  of Eq. ( 21) which make its computation \ndifferent.

RESULTS  \n6.1 Dataset  \nLack of reliable dataset for Persian music was one of our \nmain problems, so  for evaluating the system a dataset for \nIranian traditional music  is collected . The dataset consist s of \n210 tracks from different Dastgah types.  The Dastgah types \nand the number of  recordings from each Dastgah type are as \nfollows:  89-Shur & Nava,  30-Segah,  41-Mahur &  Rast-\npanjgah,  26-Homayun and 24 -Chahargah.  \nThe colle ction was mainly based on vocal , and some  \nmonophonic musical pieces from some popular traditional \ninstruments such a s Santur,  Tar, Setar and Kamancheh. The \nvocals w ere from three prominent Iranian vocalists such as \nMahmud Karimi,  69 tracks, Abdullah Davami,  57 tracks,  \nMuhammad Reza Shajarian,  20 tracks and also some other \nwell trained vocalist. For a better evaluation, we also used 21  \ntracks from Arabian Maqams .2 \n6.2 Pattern Similarity  \nThe Persian musical scales  are so similar to each other and  \n                                                           \n2Segah Maqam (Dastgah) is a common mode in Iranian and Arabian music.  \nAjam Maqam in Arabian music is also so similar to Iranian Chahargah scale.  it is a considerable obstacle for  Dastgah  detection . Table 3  \nshows the degree of similarity between our Dastgah  \nprototypes  based on JSM for IT2FSs.  The Chaharga, Mahur \nand Rast -panjgah modes have the maximum similarity \ndegree, about 73%,  while Chahargah and  Segah mode s have \nthe minimum similarity degree, about 43%.  \nTable 3.

We segment each son g of our dataset to \nseveral portions  with arbitrary lengths . By evaluating the \nsystem with  the song segments , it is found  that about one \nminu te of any  song is necessary and sufficient  for Dastgah  \ndetection , so we can use only one minute of a given song  to \nmake the process of Dastgah  detection faster . \nThe Dastgah recognition system can r ecognize the modes \nwith overall accuracy  of 85%. It is evaluated by computing \nthe para meters such as Rec all, Precision,  Accuracy,  F-\nmeasure and Matthews C orrel ation Coefficient (MCC). Table \n4 shows the performance of  the classifier  according to above \nmeasures. The MCC is computed as  \nùëÄùê∂ùê∂= ùëáùëÉ‚àóùëáùëÅ ‚àí(ùêπùëÉ‚àóùêπùëÅ)\n  ùëáùëÉ+ùêπùëÉ  ùëáùëÉ+ùêπùëÅ  ùëáùëÅ+ùêπùëÉ  ùëáùëÅ+ùêπùëÅ  ,            (23)                                      \nWhere TP: True Positive, TN: True Negative, FP: False \nPositive and FN: False Negative.  \nThe MCC is used as a measure of the quality of binary \n(two-class) classifications. It balances true and false positives \nand negatives . It can be used even if the classes are of very \ndifferent sizes, like our dataset which the number of  songs \nvaries for each Dastgah. T he MCC is  also the best way for \ndescribing the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix of the \nclassifier  is presented in Table 5.  \nTable 4.

CONCLUSION  \nWe presented a method for Iranian traditional music Dastgah \nclassification.  The method works by assuming each piece of \nmusic as a set of IT2FSs an d recognize  the Dastgah of the \nsong by finding the maximum similarity between IT2FSs of   \nthe song and Dastgah prototypes. The system makes no \nassumption about the data except that the Dastgahs have \ndifferent scale steps. The met hod was shown to work on \nsmall -sized dataset  accurately.  \nUsing Gaussian shaped FOUs; the Dastgah  recognition \nsystem only supports intrauncertainty, which is the \nuncertainty a musician has about the scale steps. It is a \ncandidate of future work to collect  data from several \nmusic ians about tuning the scale steps of  Dastgahs. Then use \nthe method of liu et al. [12] for constructing the FOUs . After \nthat, the system  can support interuncertainty, which is the \nuncertainty that a group of musicians have about the sc ale \nsteps [9].  Moreover , in the future work,  the system must be \nequipped with  a Gushe (or melody) recognition sy stem .   \n8. REFERENCES  \n[1] Vaziri, A.

INTRODUCTION\nA lot of music pieces show stylistic inÔ¨Çuences from multiple\nmusic genres. These inÔ¨Çuences usually can be linked to the\nindividual instrument tracks of a song. Instead of modelling\nmusic pieces as a whole, we believe that it is more meaning-\nful to characterize them on a track-level. In this publication,\nwe investigate double-track recordings including bass and\ndrum instruments. Both instruments are essential parts of\nthe so-called ‚Äúrhythm section‚Äù that establishes the rhythmic\nand harmonic foundation of a band that performs a piece\nof music. The bass track and drum track usually follow a\nrepeating, pattern-based structure.\nThe contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we\npresent new features for the rhythmic and tonal analysis of\ninstrument tracks. Second, we investigate the applicability\nof regression models to model semantic attributes of instru-\nment tracks based on human ratings. Since these attributes\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.have a continuous scale, we use regression algorithms rather\nthan classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms to automatically predict their\nvalues for a given recording. The attributes introduced in\nthis work (see Sect. 5) allow to describe a piece of music on\na more abstract level than features derived from music the-\nory allow. This semantic level opens up a more general per-\nspective to characterize, to compare, and to retrieve music\npieces. It is furthermore accessible to a broader selection of\nusers since it does not require detailed musical knowledge.\n2. GOALS & CHALLENGES\nWe aim to develop a regression-based prediction system that\nautomatically characterizes double-track bass and\ndrum recordings in terms of Ô¨Åve different tonal and rhythmic\nattributes. Since the recordings we investigate cover various\nmusic styles from different regional backgrounds, we need\nto identify features that allow a robust semantic description\nindependent of stylistic idiosyncrasies.\n3. PREVIOUS WORK\nIn the last decade, score-based audio features (high-level\nfeatures) were mainly applied for classiÔ¨Åcation tasks such\nas genre classiÔ¨Åcation [2, 3, 7]. In contrast to low-level and\nmid-level audio features such as the spectral Ô¨Çux or the Mel-\nFrequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC), high-level\nfeatures relate to expressions of music theory to character-\nize instrument tracks in terms of rhythmic and tonal prop-\nerties. These features are derived based a score representa-\ntion of a music piece, which can be generated either by an\nautomatic transcription of real audio Ô¨Åles or directly from\nsymbolic formats such as MIDI. In the past, most methods\nto extract high-level features comprise a statistical analysis\nof note onsets, pitches, and intervals [3, 8]. In [4], differ-\nent regression algorithms were compared to predict differ-\nent emotion ratings based on extracted audio features. Mu-\nsic recordings with guitar, bass guitar, and drums were ana-\nlyzed as presented in [1] based on rhythmic high-level fea-\ntures. In this publication, three different conÔ¨Ågurations of\nregression models were compared to model 8 different mu-\nsical attributes related to different instruments.\n209Poster Session 2\nFigure 1 . Processing steps including the manual annotation\nstep, feature extraction, and regression analysis.\n4. DATASET\nIn this study, we use a collection of 70 two-track record-\nings including a drum track and a bass track taken from\ninstructional bass literature [10] as dataset. These tracks\ncover different Western music styles such as blues, funk,\nboogie, and modern jazz, Non-western styles from Latin and\nSouth America such as Cuban mambo, reggae, and samba as\nwell as some African styles. All audio recordings were per-\nformed by professional musicians in a recording studio. The\nprocessing steps pursued in this study are depicted in Fig. 1.\nWe used the audio recordings for the manual annotation of\nthe given attributes as explained in Sect. 5. In addition, we\nextracted a score representation of the bass track based on\nthe related score sheets and manually transcribed the drum\ntrack. Both track transcriptions were stored as MIDI Ô¨Åles for\nfurther analysis. The question of automatic bass and drum\ntranscription is not within the scope of this paper.\n5. ANNOTATION PROCESS\nFor the annotations, we recruited 11 participants of differ-\nent levels of musical education (most of them being semi-\nprofessional musicians). The participants were asked to an-\nnotate each audio track according to the attributes harmonic\nclarity (HClar ),harmonic predictability (HPred ),rhythmic\nclarity (RClar ),rhythmic coherence (RCoh ), and danca-\nbility (Dan) using a 7-point numeric scale between 1 (very\nlow) and 7 (very high) with 4 being the neutral value. All\nattributes were introduced to the participants based on ex-\nplanatory questions as shown in Tab. 1. The Annotation\nTool previously presented in [11] was used for the subjects\nto manually assign attribute values for all recordings within\nthe dataset. The participants were allowed to skip single an-\nnotations if they were unsure of their annotations for those\nparticular tracks.6. FEATURE EXTRACTION\nWe used the MIDI toolbox [5] to extract the basic score pa-\nrameters absolute pitch Œ∏P,Aof all notes of the bass track\nas well as onset œïO(in fractions of bar lengths) and du-\nrationœïD(in fractions of bar lengths) of all notes of both\ntracks from the MIDI Ô¨Åles. Based on these note parame-\nters, we compute high-level features related to rhythmic and\ntonal properties of both tracks as explained in the following\nsections. Both œïOandœïDprovide a tempo-independent\nrhythmic representation of the bass line. In addition to the\nbass track ( BA), we split the drum track ( DR) into the three\ninstrument sub-tracks bass-drum ( BD), snare drum & rim-\nshot ( SD), and hi-hat & cymbals ( HH). In this section, we\nÔ¨Årst explain pre-processing steps and then illustrate the ex-\ntracted rhythmic and tonal features. For each feature, the\ncorresponding instrument tracks are given in brackets.\n6.1 Rhythmic features\n6.1.1 Pre-processing\nMetric level\nIn order to emphasize notes that occur on strong metric po-\nsitions, we compute the metric level liof each note within\nthe metric hierarchy of the corresponding bar. All examples\nwithin the dataset are in a4\n4time signature, thus we deÔ¨Åne\nthe quarter notes as the beat-level . If the note onset corre-\nsponds to a beat position within the beat-level, we obtain\nli= 1, if it is not on the beat level but still on the Ô¨Årst sub-\nbeat level (eight-notes), we obtain li= 2, and so forth. For\nsimpliÔ¨Åcation, we assign both triplets as well as duplets to\nthe same rhythmic level.\nSimilarity matrix (based on Levenshtein distance)\nFor each instrument track and each bar, we extract sequences\nmade of the corresponding notes. Each note is represented\nby its modiÔ¨Åed note onset ÀÜœïO=œïOmod1.

For each pair of bars, the\nscaling factor dmax corresponds to the length of the longer\nnote sequence. See [1] for further details.\n6.1.2 Features\nAverage metric level (BA,DR)\nIn order to characterize the rhythmic complexity of an in-\nstrument track, we compute the average metric level liover\nall notes of this track as feature.\nTempo (All)\nWe use the tempo in BPM derived from the function get-\ntempo from the MIDI toolbox.\n21012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nAttribute Related instru-\nment track(s)Explanatory questions\nHClar BA How clear could you imagine the harmonic content / harmonic progression of the music by\njust listening to the bass line?\nHPred BA When listening to the excerpt for the Ô¨Årst time, did you Ô¨Ånd the harmonic progression im-\nplied by the bass line predictable, or was it on the contrary surprising and unexpected?\nRClar BA&DR How clear could you perceive the rhythmic structure (beat positions) by listening to the bass\nand the drums?\nRCoh BA&DR Did the two instruments contribute to a coherent rhythmic structure, or did they contradict?\nDan BA&DR While listening to the music, could you imagine that it is easy to dance to it or not?\nTable 1 . Attributes used for manual annotations.\nNote density (BA,DR)\nWe compute the number of notes Nmper bar. Then we take\nthe mean and standard deviation of all values of Nmas fea-\ntures.\nRhythmic similarity within instrument tracks (BA,DR)\nWe compute mean and standard deviation over all similarity\nvaluessm,nwithm/negationslash=nto measure the average similarity\nbetween all bars of an instrument track as well as its vari-\nance.\nRhythmic similarity between instrument tracks (BA-BD,BA-\nSD,BA-HH,BD-SD,BD-HH, and HH-SD)\nSimilar to the previously explained feature, we compute the\nbar-wise similarity between the bass and drum track pairs\nBA-BD,BA-SD,BA-HH, and the drum track pairs BD-SD,BD-HH,\nand HH-SD. For instance, this allows to detect whether the\nbass and the bass-drum track play rhythmically in unison or\nnot. The participants agreed that this particular conÔ¨Ågura-\ntion contributes to the perception of a high rhythmic coher-\nence between the bass and the drum instrument.\nDivergence from a (Western) prototype rhythm (DR)\nIn accordance to the statements of various participants, we\nidentiÔ¨Åed a prototypic drum rhythm1as illustrated in Fig.\n2 that was said to serve as a rhythmic orientation for locat-\ning the beat positions in an unknown bass and drum groove.\nTherefore, we assume that the similarity between a given\ndrum track and this prototype rhythm can be interpreted as a\nmeasure that is proportional to the perceived rhythmic clar-\nity. For each of the drum instrument tracks BD,SD, and HH,\nwe compute the similarity based on the Levenshtein distance\nas explained above between the real drum track and the cor-\nresponding track in the prototype rhythm. Finally, we av-\n1This rhythm can be found in different Western music genres. Consid-\nering that most of the participants said to have only minor listening experi-\nence with Latin American and African rhythms, we only take this rhythm\nas a basis of comparison even though a couple of Latin American bass and\ndrum grooves are present in the database.\nPage 1/1]441B^^B^^B^^B^^Figure 2 .

The three\ndrum classes introduced in Sec. 6 are represented by the\nlowest note (bass drum - BD), the middle note (snare drum -\nSD), and the cross-note (hi-hat - HH).\nerage the similarity over all three instruments to derive an\noverall similarity measure for the complete drum track. This\nmeasure is averaged over all bars and taken as feature.\n6.2 Tonal features\n6.2.1 Pre-processing\nChromatic pitch representation\nThe chromatic pitch class Œ∏P,Crepresents all absolute pitch\nvalues mapped to one octave as Œ∏P,C=Œ∏P,Amod 12with\nŒ∏P,C‚àà[0,11]. The note name Ccorresponds to Œ∏P,C= 0.\nDiatonic interval representation\nŒ∏Idenotes the intervals between adjacent notes in semi-\ntones. After all intervals are mapped to a maximum abso-\nlute value of 12, we derive a diatonic interval representation\nŒ∏I,Dthat corresponds to the musical interval labels unison\n(Œ∏I,D= 1), second (Œ∏I,D= 2), and so forth up to seventh\n(Œ∏I,D= 7). The octave ( Œ∏I= 12 orŒ∏I=‚àí12) is consid-\nered as a unison ( Œ∏I= 0) here according to the modulo-12\noperation. For reasons of simpliÔ¨Åcations, we convert all de-\nscending intervals Œ∏I,D<0into their complementary inter-\nvals, i.e., a descending second ( Œ∏I,D=‚àí2) to an ascending\nseventh (Œ∏I,D= 7) etc.\nBass note detection\nWe aim to detect the dominant bass note in each bar. Since\nno other instrument track is available for harmonic analysis,\nwe use this bass note as harmonic reference for the compu-\n211Poster Session 2\ntation of different tonal features. First, we retrieve all chro-\nmatic pitch classes ÀÜŒ∏P,C apparent in a bar of the bass line.\nThen, we compute a chromatic presence valueŒ±, which ac-\ncumulates the duration values œïD,iof all notes associated to\nthe same chromatic pitch class ÀÜŒ∏P,C,k within this bar:\nŒ±(ÀÜŒ∏P,C,k ) =/summationdisplay\n‚àÄi‚ÜîŒ∏P,C,i=ÀÜŒ∏P,C,k1\nliœïD,i (1)\nEach note is weighted according to its metrical level by the\nweighting factor 1/li(see Sect. 6.1.1). This is because notes\non strong metric positions are assumed to be more likely\nperceived as bass notes than notes on weak metric positions.\nFinally, we obtain the chromatic pitch class of the bass note\nŒ∏P,C,B in this bar by maximizing Œ±over all apparent chro-\nmatic pitch classes as\nŒ∏P,C,B =ÀÜŒ∏P,C,k‚àó‚Üîk‚àó= arg max\nkŒ±(ÀÜŒ∏P,C,k ).(2)\n6.2.2 Features\nPercentage of bass note changes (BA)\nSince we assume that the bass note acts as an indicator for\nthe predominant harmony in a bar, we compute the number\nof bass note changes in a bass line divided by its length in\nbars as feature.\nDiatonic intervals related to the bass note (BA)\nIn each bar, we compute the interval between the chromatic\npitch class of all bass notes and the chromatic pitch class\nof the estimated bass-note Œ∏P,C,B . Then, we derive the di-\natonic representation Œ∏I,Dof this interval in the same way\nas previously explained in Sect. 6.2.1. If the bass note re-\nlates to the root note of the current chord and the bass line\nplays mainly thirds and Ô¨Åfths ( Œ∏I,D= 3,Œ∏I,D= 5), we\nexpect the harmonic predictability to be high since the bass\nuses main chord tones. Therefore, we compute n(Œ∏I,D=\n3) +n(Œ∏I,D= 5))//summationtextn(Œ∏I,D)as feature with n(Œ∏I,D)in-\ndicating the number of notes with the given diatonic interval\nvalue. If only a small number of different diatonic intervals\nare present, we assume the harmonic complexity of a bass\nline to be low. Therefore, we compute the zero-order en-\ntropy over the probability values\np(Œ∏I,D) =n(Œ∏I,D)//summationtextn(Œ∏I,D)as second feature:\nH0=‚àí/summationdisplay\np(Œ∏I,D)log2[p(Œ∏I,D)] (3)\nTonal similarity between subsequences (BA)\nTo measure the tonal complexity of a bass line, we inves-\ntigate, whether it is repeated after a certain number of bars.\nTherefore, we subdivide the bass line into adjacent\nsub-sequences of a length of L= 1,L= 2, andL= 4\nbars. Each sub-sequence is represented by the absolute pitchvalues of the included notes. Again, we compute a similar-\nity measure based on the Levenshtein distance as described\nin the previous section. Bass lines are often repeated after\na few bars but played in a transposed form, i.e., translated\nin pitch by a constant term. To cope with that, we sub-\ntract the lowest pitch value from all absolute pitch values\nin each sub-sequence that is to be compared. Finally, we\naverage the similarity values between all adjacent pairs of\nsub-sequences (e.g. for L= 1, we compare bar 1 with bar\n2, bar 2 with bar 3, and so on) and derive one feature value\nfor each sub-sequence length.\n7. EVALUATION\n7.1 Regression analysis\nWe compare 5 different conÔ¨Ågurations of regression mod-\nels based on Robust Regression (RR), Partial Least-Squares\nRegression (PLSR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR).\nThe RR uses an iteratively algorithm to assign a weight to\neach data point within the training data. This way, outliers\nhave a smaller inÔ¨Çuence on the regression model. A differ-\nent approach is followed by PLSR. A smaller number of less\ncorrelated predictor variables is derived from a linear com-\nbination of the initial feature dimensions. For the PLSR, we\ninvestigate the inÔ¨Çuence of a preceding feature selection via\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). Therefore, we select\nall feature dimensions with eigenvalues Œª > 1during the\nPCA. We then determine the optimal model order for the\nPLSR models by minimizing the Akaike information crite-\nrion (AIC). For the SVR, we compare ŒΩ-SVR and/epsilon1-SVR as\nprovided by the LibSVM toolbox [6]. We used the RBF\nkernel with parameter Œ≥and cost factor Cfor both con-\nÔ¨Ågurations. Based on a three-stage grid search, we deter-\nmine the optimal parameters {C,Œ≥,ŒΩ}for theŒΩ-SVR and\n{C,Œ≥,/epsilon1}for the/epsilon1-SVR2by minimizing the mean squared\nerror (MSE) value. For more details on the regression meth-\nods, see for instance [6] and [9].\nFor each attribute, we select the features that are used\nfor the model training as illustrated in the third column of\nTab. 3. Leave-one-out cross-validation is used to evaluate\neach conÔ¨Åguration-attribute pair and to avoid model over-\nÔ¨Åtting, i.e., a different sample is used within each fold for\ntesting and the remaining 69 samples are used for training\nof the regression models. Within each fold, all vectors of the\ntraining set are normalized to zero mean and unit variance.\nThen, the feature vector of the test set is normalized using\nthe mean and standard deviation vectors derived from the\ntraining set. The MSE is computed between the predicted\nvalues and the ground-truth values of the test set and av-\neraged over 70 folds.

The danca-\nbility of a bass and drum groove seems to be mainly inÔ¨Çu-\nenced by its rhythmic attributes ( rDan,RClar =.38,\nrDan,RCoh =.31).\nRegression experiment\nThe results of the regression experiments outlined in Sect.\n7.1 are illustrated in Tab. 3. As depicted in the upper part\nof the table, the SVR models lead to the smallest MSE val-\nues for all 5 attributes where the PLSR models performed\nonly slightly worse. The models for HClar andRClar show\nthe smallest prediction errors, while harmonic predictability\nshow the highest errors. The RR performed worse for all\nattributes.\nThe sample correlation coefÔ¨Åcients and the correspond-\ning p-values are given in the lower part of the table. In\ncontrast to the MSE values, highest (signiÔ¨Åcant) correlation\ncoefÔ¨Åcients can be observed for the attributes HPred with\nr=.59andDan withr=.46. All signiÔ¨Åcant correlations\ncan be observed for models based on PLSR with preceding\nPCA or based on /epsilon1-SVR. No model show signiÔ¨Åcant corre-\nlation for the attribute HClar .\nComments of participants\nWe identiÔ¨Åed a couple of problems during additional inter-\nviews with the participants after the annotation step. Two\nparticipants generally had difÔ¨Åculties to distinguish between\nclarity and predictability. The attributes HClar andHPred\nwere said be the most complicated ones to annotate since\nthe majority of the participants were not used to listen just tothe bass and the drum instrument without any accompanying\nharmony instrument. Since the attribute HPred achieved the\nhighest estimation errors as shown above, we assume that\nfurther score-based features need to be extracted from the\nharmony track of a given music recording in order to model\nthis attribute.\n8. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we compared Ô¨Åve different regression algo-\nrithms for the estimation of values related to Ô¨Åve differ-\nent tonal and rhythmic attributes to characterize two-track\nrecordings of bass and drums. Score-based features were\nextracted and used as predictor variables and manual user\nannotations of 70 audio excerpts were used as response vari-\nables to train and evaluate the regression models. For all Ô¨Åve\nattributes, the PLSR+PCA model and the SVR models per-\nformed best (and comparably well) in terms of estimations\nerrors. SigniÔ¨Åcant correlations between annotated and es-\ntimated attribute values were only observed for four of the\nattributes and in particular for PLSR+PCA models and the\n/epsilon1-SVR models. Since the highest (signiÔ¨Åcant) correlation\ncoefÔ¨Åcient is r=.59, we assume that further important as-\npects of the musical performance are not well captured by\nthe applied features so far.\nIn general, we believe that the presented approach can\nbe generalized to multi-track recordings including other in-\nstruments. However, we think that human attribute ratings\nshould be based on listening to the isolated tracks instead of\nlistening to the mixture signal. One issue of future work is\nto investigate how strong the perception of these attributes\ndiffers when human annotators listen to mixture of multiple\ninstruments instead.\n9.

INTRODUCTION\nMeasuring similarity between symbolically encoded music\nhas been studied extensively, with several approaches ex-\nisting. Similarity measuring between pieces of polyphonic\nmusic is far from trivial, but the extensive amount of ap-\nplications(forexample,querybyexamplemusicretrieving )\nthatrequiresuchmeasuringmotivatestoexplorenoveltech -\nniques for thetask.\nHere, we present an approach that is based on mapping\nthe pitches present in a given time frame to tonal centroid\nvectors, quantizing the tonal centroid values, and represe nt-\ning the obtained information as a sequence of characters.\nFor measuring similarity between sequences, we apply nor-\nmalizedcompressiondistance(NCD)[2],whichisaparamete r-\nfree, quasi-universal similaritymetric[2].\nWe believe that NCD is applicable to polyphonic, sym-\nbolic music similarity measuring, since there are already\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this noticeand thefull citation ontheÔ¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011International Society forMusic InformationRetrieval .several existing, well-performing classiÔ¨Åcation and clus ter-\ningapproachesutilizingNCDasthesimilaritymetric. How-\never,thepreviouslydevelopedNCD-basedmethodsallseem\ntorelyonrathercruderepresentationsofmusic,suchassky -\nline reduction or melodic contour description, both which\nlose a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of tonal information. We wish to\nkeep as much of the tonal information included as possible\nbut the amount of parallel pitch values may be large, even\nif the octave information is ignored and values are reduced\nintoa12-dimensionchromagram(alsoknownaspitchclass\nproÔ¨Åle). Therefore, dimension reduction is needed, and for\nthis, we use a method with musical knowledge. This is\nwhere the tonal centroid representation [4] seems a feasi-\nble solution, as it turns a 12-dimension chromagram into a\n6-dimensional representation, still holding most of the ha r-\nmonic information and also some of the melodic informa-\ntion.\nTo see how well our approach performs in a particular\nsimilarity measuring task, we use it to determine whether a\ngiven piece of music is a variation of an original theme in-\ncluded in the training data. This task is challenging and a\nvery suitable way to evaluate our method, as it is objective\n(in comparison to, for example, genre classiÔ¨Åcation), and\nin order to be successful, the method must retain tonal in-\nformation and still be able to measure the essential musical\nsimilarity without too much complexity. We evaluate our\napproach with a set of 18 classical compositions and their\nvariations, and based on the results, discuss the remarks we\ndiscoveredinourevaluations,suggestingseveralissuest hat\nneed to be addressed when using NCD for similarity mea-\nsuring with polyphonic music, and present ideas for future\nresearch work.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-\ntion 2 we review methods of similarity measuring between\nsymbolic, polyphonic pieces of music. In Section 3 we\npresent the methods used for extracting tonal information\nfrom MIDI Ô¨Åles and representing the information in a for-\nmat suitable for compressor-based similarity measurement .\nExperiments on the method are presented in Section 4 and\nconclusions inSection 5.\n91Poster Session 1\n2. RELATED WORK\nIn the early days of similarity measuring of symbolically\nencoded music, linear string representation together with\nstringmatchingmethodswasmostoftenused. Theapproach,\nhowever, does not work with polyphonic music in general,\nexceptforsomeveryspeciÔ¨Åccases(seee.g.[3,7]). Recentl y\nseveral authors have applied geometric modeling of music\nfor the task (see e.g. [9,13,16]). Many of these algorithms\nare based on computing translation vectors, which makes\nthem transposition-invariant and also allows for extra int er-\nveningnotesthatappearinoneofthepiecesofmusicunder\nconsideration but not in the other. Recent geometric meth-\nodshavealsochallengedtimingproblems;thepiecesofmu-\nsic under consideration may be either time-scaled [5,13] or\ntime-warped [6] copies of each other.\nInteresting alternative approaches can be found in [10,\n17]. In his PhD thesis [17], Rizo introduces a tree repre-\nsentationforpolyphonicmusicandshowshowtoapplydif-\nferent tree matching algorithms for various similarity cas es\nincluding variation recognition. He also shows how to use\nhis generic representation for implementing and illustrat ing\nschenkerian reduction. In [10], Marsden concentrates on\nschenkerian reduction in recognizing polyphonic variatio ns\nof the classical era. To this end, he divides polyphony in\nthree ‚Äòvoices‚Äô: melody, middle and bass. Melody and bass\ncontainthehighestandlowestnotes,respectively,whilem id-\ndle voice contains all the notes belonging to neither of the\nprevioustwo.

In [8], Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is estimated as the size of the dictionary pro-\nduced by the LZ78 compression algorithm.

In [11], NCD\nisappliedassimilaritymeasureforstringrepresentation sof\nmusic,obtained byconverting symbolicmusicwithagraph\nstructure representation. In a recent study, NCD is used as\none of the possible similarity metrics for measuring simi-\nlarity between bass lines [15]. The bass line melodic in-\nterval histogram similarities are used as a feature for genr e\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. In [1], NCD is used for measuring similar-\nity between MIDI pieces. The polyphonic MIDI melodies\nare converted into monophonic versions by taking only the\nhighestpitchvaluepresentinatimeslice(alsoknownasthe\nskyline representation).Another method based on measuring the amount of sim-\nilarinformationbetweenpiecesofpolyphonicmusicispre-\nsented in [12]. Their work is based on using Kullback-\nLeibler divergence to measure similarity between chroma-\ngram sequences. Based on the chromagrams, a 24-chord\nlexicon (all the major and minor triad chords in the western\ntonal scale) is used to create a probability distribution, a nd\nthen Kullback-Leibler divergence is applied to measure the\nsimilarity between the distributions of the query and targe t\nmodels. The method is evaluated with classical variation\nrecognition.\n3. METHODOLOGY\nLet us next introduce the methods that we will use for ex-\ntracting tonal information from the MIDI Ô¨Åles and how to\nrepresent the information in an appropriate format for the\ncompression-based similarity measurement.

EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Test Data\nWe use the polyphonic classical music variation dataset de-\nscribed in [17] for our experiments. It is a fairly extensive\ncollection of classical themes and their variations, rangi ng\nover different values in terms of instrumentation, lengths ,\neras and numbers of voices. In addition, we also included\ntwo more compositions: the Haydn variations by Brahms,\nOp. 56 (nine variations of a theme), and the Piano Sonata\nnumber 11 by Mozart, KV 331 (six variations of a theme).\nThe total size of our dataset is 18 themes and 84 variations,\ntotalling 102 pieces of music, with the highest number of\nvariations for atheme being 30 and lowest being 1.\n4.2 Evaluations and results\nFor evaluations, we used the original themes as the training\ndata and the variations as queries. We ran the classiÔ¨Åcation\ntests with several different parameters. For each differen t\nevaluation, the overall accuracy and average precision, av -\nerage recall, and average f-measureare reported.\nFirst, we had to select the data-compression algorithm.\nWe ran the classiÔ¨Åcation test with bzip2 and prediction by\n93Poster Session 1\nCompressor bzip2PPMZ\nAccuracy 0.3930.536\nPrecision 0.5260.632\nRecall 0.3910.474\nF-measure 0.4480.542\nTable 1.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic classiÔ¨Åcation is an important problem in information\nretrieval from music data. There are a lot of researches to\ntackletheproblem(see,e.g.,[1,3,4,10,11,14,18]),ashighly\naccurate music classiÔ¨Åers are useful for music search and\nfeature extraction.\nOne of typical approaches to classify music is to rep-\nresent each music data as a feature vector, which is then\nclassiÔ¨Åed by standard machine learning methods. On the\nother hand, Ô¨Ånding good features for music classiÔ¨Åcation is\na non-trivial task. For example, performance worm [15],\nperformance alphabet [16], and other approaches includ-\ning [1,10,11,18].\nAnotherpopularapproachinMachineLearningistouse\nsupport vector machines (SVMs) with kernels [7‚Äì9,12,19].\nOne way to improve accuracy of music classiÔ¨Åcation is to\ndesign a good kernel for music data. This approach, how-\never, does not seem to be very successful so far. As we\nwill show later, well known string kernels such as n-gram\nkernels [12] and mismatch kernels [8] for texts do not ob-\ntain satisfactory results for music classiÔ¨Åcation in our ex-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.periments. Further, to design a kernel, the function to be\ndesignedneedstobepositivesemideÔ¨Ånite,whichisalimita-\ntionwhenwetrytoexploitthestructureofmusictoimprove\nclassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy.\nInthispaper,wefollowanalternativeapproach. Weem-\nploy a (dis)similarity-based learning framework proposed\nbyWangetal.[20]. This(dis)similarity-basedapproachhas\na theoretical guarantee that one can obtain accurate classi-\nÔ¨Åersusing(dis)similaritymeasuresunderanaturalassump-\ntion. In addition, the advantage of this approach is able to\nuseany(dis)similarity measures which do not have to be\npositivesemideÔ¨Ånite and anydata.\nFurther, we combine this (dis)similarity-based learning\napproach with 1-norm soft margin optimization formula-\ntion[5,22]. Anadvantageoftheformulationisthatitisuse-\nful for feature selection because of the sparse nature of the\nunderlying solution. In other words, the formulation help\nus to Ô¨Ånd ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù instances (i.e., music data) to classify\nmusic. Suchrelevantinstancesmightcontainrepresentative\nfeaturesoftheclass. Therefore,itmightbeusefultoextract\ngood features.\nFor simplicity, throughout the paper, we deal with clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation problems of symbolic music data such as MIDI\nÔ¨Ålesonly. Thuswedonotconsideraudiosignaldataandwe\nassume (dis)similarity functions over texts. Note that our\nframework using (dis)similarity functions does not depend\non the data format. We can deal with audio signal data as\nwell if we employ(dis)similarity functions oversignals.\nWedemonstratetheeffectivenessofourapproachincom-\nputational experiments using Japanese music data. Our ap-\nproach,combinedwithnon-positivesemideÔ¨Ånite(dis)similarity\nmeasures such as edit distance, shows better performance\nthan SVMs with string kernels.\n2. LEARNING FRAMEWORKUSING\nDISSIMILARITYFUNCTION\nIn this section, we review a learning framework using dis-\nsimilarity function proposed by Wang et al. [20]. Let Xbe\nthe instance space. We assume that a dissimilarity function\nd(x, x/prime)is a function from X√óXtoR+. A pair (x, y)of\ninstance x‚ààXand label y‚àà {‚àí 1,1}is called an example.\nFor instance, Xmight be some set of MIDI data and then\n693Poster Session 6\nan example is a pair of a MIDI Ô¨Åle and positive or negative\nlabel. The learner is given a set Sof examples, where each\nexample is drawn randomly and independently from an un-\nknowndistribution Pover X√ó{‚àí 1,+1}. Then,thelearner\nis supposed to output a hypothesis h(x) : X ‚Üí {‚àí 1,1}.\nThe goal of the learner is to minimize the error of the hy-\npothesis hw. r. t. the distribution P, i.e., the probability\nthathmisclassiÔ¨Åes the label of a randomly drawn example\n(x, y)according to P,Pr\n(x,y)‚àºP(h(x)/negationslash=y).In particular, we\nassumethatahypothesisisconstructedusingadissimilarity\nfunction d.

We should note that\nthe existence of a (/epsilon1, Œ∑)-good dissimilarity function might\nbe too restrictive in some cases. For such cases, Wang et al.\nalsoproposedmorerelaxeddeÔ¨Ånitionsofgooddissimilarity\nfunctions. Under such relaxed deÔ¨Ånitions, it can be shown\nthat there existsa weighted combination\nf(x) =m‚àë\ni=1wihi(x),where each wi‚â•0,‚àë\niwi= 1,hi(x) = sgn[ d(x/prime/prime\ni, x)‚àí\nd(x/prime\ni, x)]andx/prime/prime\niandx/prime\niare positive and negative instances,\nsuch that sgn[f(x)]is accurate enough (see [20] for the de-\ntails).\n3. OUR FORMULATION\nInthissection,weconsiderhowtoÔ¨Åndanaccurateweighted\ncombination of base classiÔ¨Åers consisting of a pair of posi-\ntiveandnegativeinstances. Todoso,weemploythe 1-norm\nsoft margin optimization, which is a standard formulation\nof classiÔ¨Åcation problems in Machine Learning (see,e.g, [5,\n21]). Simply put, the problem is to Ô¨Ånd a linear combi-\nnation of base classiÔ¨Åers (or a hyperplane over the space\ndeÔ¨Åned by base classiÔ¨Åers) which has large margin with re-\nspecttoexamples,wherethemarginofalinearcombination\nwwithrespecttoanexample zisadistancebetween wand\nz. Infact,thelargemargingeneralizationtheory(e.g.,[17])\nguarantees that a weighted combination of base classiÔ¨Åer\nis likely to have higher accuracy when it has larger margin\nw.r.t. examples. Further, an additional advantage of 1-norm\nsoft margin optimization is that the resulting linear combi-\nnation of base classiÔ¨Åers is likely to be sparse since we reg-\nularize 1-norm of the weight vector. This property is useful\nfor feature selection tasks.\n3.1 The 1-norm soft marginformulation\nSupposethatwearegivenaset S={(x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym)},\nwhere each (xi, yi)is an example in X√ó {‚àí 1,+1}. Here,\nfollowing the dissimilarity-based approach in the previous\nsection, we assume the set of hypotheses, H={h(x) =\nsgn[d(xi, x)‚àíd(xj, x)]|xiandxjare positive and neg-\native instances in S, respectively }. For simplicity of the\nnotation, we denote HasH={h1, . . . , h n}, where nis\nthe number of pairs of positive and negative examples in S.\nThen, the 1-norm soft margin optimization problem is for-\nmulated as follows(e.g. [5,21]):\nmax\nœÅ,b‚ààR,w‚ààRn,Œæ‚ààRmœÅ‚àí1\nŒΩm‚àë\ni=1Œæi (2)\nsub.to\nyi(‚àë\njwjhj(xi) +b)‚â•œÅ‚àíŒæi(i= 1, . . . , m ),\nw‚â•0,n‚àë\nj=1wj= 1\nŒæ‚â•0.\nHeretheterm yi(‚àë\njwjhj(xi)+b)representsthemargin\nofthehyperplane (w, b)w.r.t. anexample (xi, yi)whenthe\n1-norm of wis constrained to be 1. It is known that the\nmarginismeasuredas ‚àû-normdistancebetween (w, b)and\n69412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(xi, yi)[13]. The parameter œÅmeans the minimum margin.\nNote that if the margin is positive w.r.t. all the examples,\nthe examples are linearly-separable. For the case when the\ndata is inseparable, we allow each example to violate the\nminimum margin œÅby the amount of Œæi. So, the problem\nis to maximize the minimum margin œÅwhile minimizing\nthe sum of losses deÔ¨Åned as Œæi. The parameter ŒΩ‚àà[1, m]\ncontrols the tradeoff between maximization of the margin\nand minimization of losses.\nBy using Lagrangian duality (e.g. [2]), the dual problem\nis givenas follows:\nmin\nŒ≥,dŒ≥(3)\nsub.to\nEdged(hj) =‚àë\nidiyihj(xi)‚â§Œ≥(j= 1, . . . , n ),\nd‚â§1\nŒΩ1,\nd‚â•0,m‚àë\ni=1di= 1\nd¬∑y= 0.\nThe dual problem is about Ô¨Ånding a distribution dover\nexamples satisfying linear constraints. In particular, since\nyihj(xi) = 1if and only if hj(xi) = yi,Edged(hj)can\nbe viewed as a weighted accuracy of the hypothesis of hj\nw.r.t. the distribution d. So, in other words, a solution d‚àó\nof the dual problem is the most ‚ÄúdifÔ¨Åcult‚Äù distribution w.r.t.\nhypothesesin H. Notethat,sincethebothproblems(2)and\n(3)arelinearprograms,theseproblemsareequivalent. That\nis, if we solve one problem, we can obtain a solution of the\nother problem as well.\nWe solve the dual problem (3) using LPBoost [5], which\nis shown in Algorithm 1. LPBoost chooses a hypothesis\nh‚ààHand solve a sub-problem of the dual problem (3) it-\neratively until some termination condition is satisÔ¨Åed. It is\nknown that after sufÔ¨Åcient number of iterations, output by\nLPBoost converges to a solution of the problem (3). More\nprecisely,thefollowingstatementholdsforanygivenpreci-\nsion parameter Œª > 0.\nTheorem2 (Demiriz et al.

COMPUTATIONALEXPERIMENT\nIn this section, we show preliminary experimental results.\nThe task we consider is classiÔ¨Åcation problems over a data\nset of Japanese songs.Algorithm 1 LPBoost( S,Œª)\n(1) Let d1be the uniform distributionover S.\n(2) For t= 1, . . . ,\n(a) Chooseahypothesis h(t)‚ààHwhoseedgew.r.t.\ndtismore than Œ≥t+Œª.\n(b) Ifsuchahypothesisdoesnotexistin H,letT=\nt‚àí1and break.\n(c) Solve the soft margin optimization prob-\nlem (3) w.r.t. the restricted hypothesis set\n{h(1), . . . , h(t)}.

[6].\nFor the original data in the MIDI format, we specify a\nparticular channel which corresponds to principal melody,\nand extract a single sequence consisting of notes and rests,\nwhereanoteisapairofpitchanddurationvaluesandarest\nhas only a duration value. We choose the highest pitch if\nmore than one pitch is ‚ÄúNOTE ON‚Äù at an instant. In addi-\ntion we quantize the obtained data so that all the duration\nvaluesaremultiplesoftheMIDIdeltatimecorrespindingto\nthe sixteenth note. Then we convert the quantized note/rest\nsequences into string data of three types (see Figure 1):\nPitch string Wedivideeachnote(rest)intosixteenthnotes\n(rests) to produce a string consisting of pitches and\nrests. For simplicity, we ignore an octave difference,\nandthereforethenumberofpossiblepitchesistwelve.\nThealphabet size is thus 13.\nRhythmstring Similarly, we divide each note (rest) into\nsixteenthnotes(rests)andproduceastringconsisting\nof four symbols: N(beginning fragment of a note),\n695Poster Session 6\nClassiÔ¨Åer SVM our method\n(dis)similaritymeasure n-gramkernel mismatchkernel n-gramkernel mismatchkernel edit distance LCS\nPitch Nontransposed 61.34 65.55 70.16 73.52 86.12 79.42\nTransposed 61.34 65.55 70.16 73.52 86.12 79.42\nRhythm 86.97 86.97 88.67 89.90 87.79 92.87\nNote Nontransposed 66.39 71.01 76.46 79.81 87.38 85.33\nTransposed 66.39 71.01 76.46 79.81 87.38 85.33\nTable1.

The alphabet size is 26.\nFor pitch strings and note strings, we have an option to\ntranspose them into C major (C minor).\n4.2 ClassiÔ¨Åcation algorithms\nThe algorithms we examined are SVMs with string kernels\nand LPBoost with the (dis)similarity-based learning frame-\nwork (our method). For SVMs, we used n-gram kernels [9]\nwith n= 1, . . . , 10and mismatch kernels [8] with parame-\ntersn= 2, . . . , 20andk= 1, . . . , n ‚àí1. Forothersettings,\nWeused defaultparameters of LIBSVM for SVMs.\nFor our method, we used two (dis)similarity measures:\nthelengthofLongestCommonSubsequence(LCS)andthe\neditdistance,inadditiontothestringkernelsusedforSVMs.\nFor the parameter ŒΩ, we set ŒΩ=cm, where mis the given\nsample size and c= 0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25.0.3. As de-\nscribed in Section 3, we used base classiÔ¨Åers h(x) = sgn[\nd(xi, x)‚àíd(xj, x)]associatedwithpairsofpositiveinstancexiand negative instance xj. In total, we used 119‚àó119 =\n14161baseclassiÔ¨Åers.\nWe evaluated SVMs and our method by performing 5-\nfoldcrossvalidation. TheresultsaresummarizedinTable1,\nwhere the accuracies of respective methods are shown with\nbest parameters.\n4.3 Result\nAs is shown in Table 1, our method shows better perfor-\nmancethanSVMswithallkernels. Forpitchstringandnote\nstring, the best value was obtained by our method with the\nedit distance. For rhythm string, the best value was gained\nby our method with LCS. For pitch string and note string,\ntransposition in the note did not affect the classiÔ¨Åcation ac-\ncuracyin our experiments.\nOur methods with the edit distance and with LCS have\nbetter results than those with the n-gram and the mismatch\nkernels. This might be because the edit distance and LCS\ncapture characteristics of JPOP and Enka better. Over all of\nthe (dis)similarity measures and kernels we used, the best\nclassiÔ¨Åcation results were obtained on rhythm string. This\nmight be because JPOP has rather high tempo while Enka\nhas slowtempo.\nFinally,we investigatewhich base classiÔ¨Åers\nh(x) = sgn[ d(xi, x)‚àíd(xj, x)],\nassociatedwithpairsofJPOP xiandEnka xj,contributean\naccurate classiÔ¨Åcation.\nInthecaseofourmethodwiththeeditdistanceonrhythm\nstrings, among all possible 14,161 pairs, at most 66 pairs\nhave a non-zero weight in the Ô¨Ånal weighted combination\nfor all the parameters c. So, the obtained weighted combi-\nnation is quite sparse.\nWeobservethattheresultingÔ¨Ånalweightedcombination\nis sparser when we employ(dis)similarity measures.\nFor rhythm string, we choose c= 0.3andc= 0.15\nwhich give the best classiÔ¨Åcation results for LCS and the\nedit distance, respectively. We arrange all the pairs in de-\ncreasing order of their weights, and the top 10 pairs are dis-\nplayed in Tables2 and 3.\n69612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncJPOPTitle ENKATitle Weight Totalof weight\n0.3SecretHeaven Norennohana 0.430940 0.43094\nSecretHeaven AihaKirameite 0.146408 0.577349\nInMy Room Akashiabanka 0.140884 0.718233\nKimigaSuki Amagigoe 0.135359 0.853591\nRaven NyoninKouya 0.116022 0.969613\nRaven Okuhidabojou 0.024862 0.994475\nKimigaSuki Unga 0.005525 1\nTable2.

CONCLUSION\nInthispaperweaddressedthemusicclassiÔ¨Åcationproblem.\nWe employed the (dis)similarity-based learning framework\nproposed by Wang et al. [20]. Computational experiments\nshow that our method combined with string kernels such as\nthen-gramandthemismatchkernelsoutperformSVMwith\nthem. One advantage of our approach is that it can be used\ncombined with any(dis)similarity measure, which do not\nhave to be positive semideÔ¨Ånite. In fact, our method with\nLCS and the edit distance show better classiÔ¨Åcation accu-\nracy than with the string kernels. Among the three types\nof string data we examined, the rhythm string seems most\nsuited for genre classiÔ¨Åcation in our experiments. Songs in\nthe pairs with large weight in the resulting weighted com-\nbination might be representatives of respective music gen-res. We challenge classiÔ¨Åcation problem with data set of\n238 songs, however, the data set is too low to be general-\nityofthisapproach. Weneedtoexperimentbiggeramounts\nof data, and we measure classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy of not only\nsymbolic data but also audio data. Future work is not only\nmusic genre classiÔ¨Åcation but also automatic extraction of\nfeatures of music genres or composers.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nMany speech and music classiÔ¨Åers use mel-frequency cep-\nstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs), which are cosine transforms of\nmel-frequency spectral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFSCs). Over a Ô¨Åxed\ntime interval, MFSCs measure the signal frequency energy\nover mel-frequency intervals of constant- Qbandwidth. As\na result, they lose information on signal structures that are\nnon-stationary on this time interval. To minimize this loss,\nshort time windows of 23 ms are used in most applications\nsince at this resolution most signals are locally stationary.\nThe characterization of audio properties on larger time scales\nis then done by aggregating MFSC coefÔ¨Åcients in time, with\nmultiple ad-hoc methods such as Delta-MFCC [5] or MFCC\nsegments [1]. This paper shows that the non-stationary be-\nhavior lost by MFSC coefÔ¨Åcients is captured by a scatter-\ning transform which computes multiscale co-occurrence co-\nefÔ¨Åcients. A scattering representation includes MFSC-like\nmeasurements together with higher-order co-occurence co-\nefÔ¨Åcients that can characterize audio information over much\n1This work is funded by the ANR grant 0126 01.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.longer time intervals, up to several seconds. This yields ef-\nÔ¨Åcient representations for audio classiÔ¨Åcation.\nSection 2 relates MFSCs and wavelet Ô¨Ålter bank coefÔ¨Å-\ncients. It is shown that information lost by spectral energy\nmeasurements can be recovered by a scattering operator in-\ntroduced in [8]. It computes co-occurrence coefÔ¨Åcients by\ncascading wavelet Ô¨Ålter banks and rectiÔ¨Åers calculated with\nmodulus operators. A scattering transform has strong sim-\nilarities with auditory physiological models based on cas-\ncades of constant- QÔ¨Ålter banks and rectiÔ¨Åers [4, 10]. It is\nshown that second-order co-occurrence coefÔ¨Åcients carry an\nimportant part of the signal information. Section 3 gives\nan application to musical genre classiÔ¨Åcation, which shows\nthat scattering co-occurence coefÔ¨Åcients reduce classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion errors obtained with MFCCs and Delta-MFCCs.

SCATTERING REPRESENTATION\n2.1 From Mel-Frequency Spectra to Wavelets\nTo understand the information lost by mel-frequency spec-\ntral coefÔ¨Åcients, we relate them to a wavelet transform. The\nFourier transform of x(t)is written ÀÜx(œâ) =/integraltext\nx(u)e‚àíiœâudu.\nA short-time Fourier transform of xis computed as the Fourier\ntransform of xt,T(u) =x(u)wT(u‚àít), wherewTis a time\nwindow of size T:\nÀÜxt,T(œâ) =/integraldisplay\nxt,T(u)e‚àíiœâudu.\nMFSCs are obtained by averaging the spectrogram |ÀÜxt,T(œâ)|2\nover mel-frequency intervals. These intervals have a con-\nstant frequency bandwidth below 1000 Hz and a constant\noctave bandwidth above 1000 Hz. The MFSCs can thus be\nwritten\nMTx(t,j) =1\n2œÄ/integraldisplay\n|ÀÜxt,T(œâ)|2|ÀÜœàj(œâ)|2dœâ (1)\nwhere each ÀÜœàj(œâ)covers a mel-frequency interval indexed\nbyj. Applying Parseval‚Äôs theorem yields\nMTx(t,j) =/integraldisplay\n|xt,T‚ãÜœàj(u)|2du. (2)\n657Poster Session 6\nIt results that MTx(t,j)is the energy of xin a neighborhood\noftof sizeTand in the mel-frequency interval indexed by\nj. It is unable to capture non-stationary structures of dura-\ntion shorter than T, which is why Tis chosen to be small,\ntypically 23 ms .\nAt high frequencies, the Ô¨Ålters œàjare constructed by di-\nlating a single Ô¨Ålter œàwhose octave bandwidth is 1/Q:\nœàj(t) =a‚àíjœà(a‚àíjt)witha= 21/Qandj‚â§J. (3)\nThese Ô¨Ålters can thus be interpreted as dilated wavelets. The\nÔ¨Ålterœàis normalized so that its support is about 1 s. It is a\ncomplex Ô¨Ålter whose transfer function approximately covers\nthe frequency interval [2QœÄ‚àíœÄ,2QœÄ+œÄ]. Forj < J ,\nthe time support of œàjis thus smaller than aJand it covers\nthe frequency interval [2QœÄa‚àíj‚àíœÄa‚àíj,2QœÄa‚àíj+œÄa‚àíj].\nFrequencies below 2œÄQa‚àíJare covered by PÔ¨Åltersœàj(for\nJ‚â§j < J +P), having the same frequency bandwidth\nasœàJ, which is 2œÄa‚àíJ, and a time support equal to aJ.\nAlthough these low-frequency Ô¨Ålters are not dilations of œà,\nfor the sake of simplicity we shall still call them wavelets.\nThe resulting wavelet transform is a Ô¨Ålter bank deÔ¨Åned by:\nWJx(t) =/parenleftbiggx‚ãÜœÜJ(t)\nx‚ãÜœàj(t)/parenrightbigg\nj<J +P.\nThe Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ålter œÜJis a low-pass Ô¨Ålter covering the interval\n[‚àíœÄa‚àíJ,œÄa‚àíJ], which is not covered by other wavelet Ô¨Ål-\nters and whose temporal support is about aJ.\nWavelet Ô¨Ålters are designed so that for all frequencies œâ\n1‚àí/epsilon1‚â§|ÀÜœÜJ(œâ)|2+1\n2/summationdisplay\nj<J +P|ÀÜœàj(œâ)|2+|ÀÜœàj(‚àíœâ)|2‚â§1(4)\nfor a small/epsilon1. The squared norm of a signal is written /bardblx/bardbl2=/integraltext\n|x(t)|2dtand the norm of its wavelet transform is deÔ¨Åned\nby:\n/bardblWJx/bardbl2=/bardblx‚ãÜœÜJ/bardbl2+/summationdisplay\nj<J +P/bardblx‚ãÜœàj/bardbl2.\nThus by applying Parseval‚Äôs theorem one can verify that the\nÔ¨Ålter admissibility condition (4) implies that\n(1‚àí/epsilon1)/bardblx/bardbl2‚â§/bardblWJx/bardbl2‚â§/bardblx/bardbl2.\nThe wavelet Ô¨Ålter bank is thus contractive and if /epsilon1= 0, it\nis also unitary. This energy equivalence also implies that x\ncan be recovered from its wavelet transform.\nIn numerical applications we use Gabor Ô¨Ålters œà(t) =\nŒ∏(t)ei2œÄQtwhereŒ∏is Gaussian, with Q= 16 andP= 23 ,\nwhich satisfy (4) for /epsilon1= 0.02. The resulting Ô¨Ålter bank is\nshown in Figure 1.\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 600001!Figure 1 .

Let us choose the maximum wavelet\nscale to beaJ=T. The square does not play an important\nrole on the derived MFCC audio descriptors which are cal-\nculated with a logarithm. Replacing the squared amplitude\nby the amplitude yields similar measurements which can be\ncomputed directly by averaging the wavelet coefÔ¨Åcient am-\nplitudes ofx:\n|x‚ãÜœàj|‚ãÜœÜJ(t). (5)\nThis measures the signal amplitude in the frequency interval\ncovered byœàj, averaged over a neighborhood of tof dura-\ntionT=aJ. The larger T, the more information is lost by\nthis averaging.\nTo recover the information lost by averaging, observe\nthat|x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœÜJcan be written as the low-frequency com-\nponent of the wavelet transform of |x‚ãÜœàj1|:\nWJ|x‚ãÜœàj1|(t) =/parenleftbigg|x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœÜJ(t)\n|x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœàj2(t)/parenrightbigg\nj2<J+P.\nSince the wavelet transform is invertible, the information\nlost by the convolution with œÜJis recovered by the wavelet\ncoefÔ¨Åcients|x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœàj2(t). Averaged measurements are\nobtained with a low-pass Ô¨Åltering of the modulus of these\ncomplex wavelet coefÔ¨Åcients:\n||x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœàj2|‚ãÜœÜJ(t). (6)\nThese provide co-occurrence information at the scales aj1\nandaj2. Such coefÔ¨Åcients are called scattering coefÔ¨Åcients\nbecause they compute the interferences of the signal xwith\ntwo successive wavelets œàj1andœàj2. They measure the am-\nplitude of time variations of |x‚ãÜœàj1(t)|in the frequency\nintervals covered by the wavelets œàj2.

Indeed, since œà(t) =\nŒ∏(t)ei2œÄQt, it results that\n|x‚ãÜœàj1(t)|=|xj1‚ãÜŒ∏j1(t)|withxj1(t) =x(t)e‚àíi2œÄQa‚àíj1t.\nThe Fourier transform of |x‚ãÜœàj1(t)|is thus approximately\nlocated in the low-frequency interval covered by ÀÜŒ∏j1where\nŒ∏j(t) =a‚àíjŒ∏(a‚àíjt). One can verify that if j2< j 1+\nlogaQ/2then the supports of ÀÜœàj2andÀÜŒ∏j1barely overlap,\nwhich implies that ||x‚ãÜœàj1|‚ãÜœàj2|‚ãÜœÜJ(t)‚âà0.

Using FFTs, these\ncoefÔ¨Åcients are computed with O(Nlog(N/Q ))operations.\nSince the scattering transform is computed by iterating\nthe wavelet modulus operator UJ, its inversion is reduced toinvertingUJ. The wavelet transform WJis invertible with a\nstable inverse but UJloses the complex phase of wavelet\ncoefÔ¨Åcients. Inverting UJthen amounts to retrieving the\ncomplex phase from the modulus information. A surpris-\ning new result [12] proves that for appropriate wavelets, the\noperatorUJis invertible and that its inverse is continuous,\nwhich is a weak stability result. This inversion is made pos-\nsible because of the redundancy of wavelet signals x‚ãÜœàj(t),\nwhich can be exploited with a reproducing kernel projector.\nNumerical reconstructions are computed with an alternating\nprojection algorithm, which alternates between a projector\non the modulus constraint and the wavelet transform repro-\nducing kernel projector [12]. However, this algorithm does\nnot compute the exact inverse of UJbecause it is a non-\nconvex optimisation which can be trapped in local minima.\nEven though UJis invertible, xcannot be recovered ex-\nactly fromSJxcalculated at a Ô¨Ånite order mbecause all\nscattering coefÔ¨Åcients of order larger than mare set to 0.\nForT‚â§100 ms most of the audio signal energy is con-\ncentrated in Ô¨Årst-order coefÔ¨Åcients according to Table 1 and\nthe reconstruction from these Ô¨Årst-order coefÔ¨Åcients (which\ncorrespond to MFSCs) is indeed of good audio quality. As T\nincreases, reconstructions from Ô¨Årst-order coefÔ¨Åcients pro-\ngressively lose more information on transient structures and\nlose all melodic structures for T‚â•3 s. Second-order coef-\nÔ¨Åcients recover this transient information and fully restores\nmelodic structures when T= 3 s . Reconstruction examples\nare available at http://www.cmap.polytechnique.\nfr/scattering/audio/ .\n2.4 Cosine Log-Scattering\nMFCC coefÔ¨Åcients are computed as a cosine transform of\nthe logarithm of MFSC coefÔ¨Åcients. Indeed, many musi-\ncal and voiced sounds can be approximated by an excita-\ntione(t)Ô¨Åltered by resonator corresponding to a Ô¨Ålter h(t):\nx(t) =e‚ãÜh(t)[2]. MFCCs separate hfromewith a log-\narithm and a discrete cosine transform (DCT). The same\nproperty applies to scattering coefÔ¨Åcients, which are there-\nfore retransformed with a logarithm and a DCT.\nThe impulse response h(t)is typically very short so ÀÜh(œâ)\nis a regular function of œâ. Supposing that ÀÜh(œâ)is nearly\nconstant over the frequency support of ÀÜœàj1, one can verify\nthat\nx‚ãÜœàj1(t)‚âàÀÜh(2œÄQa‚àíj1)¬∑e‚ãÜœàj1(t).

The Ô¨Årst term, depending only on j1,\nonly contributes to the zero DCT coefÔ¨Åcient ( k2= 0) along\nj2. The second DCT along j1separates the remaining low-\nfrequency components along j1from high-frequency ones.\nFigure 4 indicates that the DCTs efÔ¨Åciently decorrelate\nlog-scattering coefÔ¨Åcients and concentrate the energy over\nfewer coefÔ¨Åcients. Variances were calculated for q= 1and\nq= 2on part of the GTZAN dataset in three bases: standard\nlog-scattering (solid), a PCA basis computed on another part\nof the dataset (dashes), and the DCT basis (dotted). The\nPCA basis decorrelates the log-scattering coefÔ¨Åcients and\nsince the variances in the DCT basis closely follow those in\nPCA basis, the DCT basis decorrelates them as well.\nFor classiÔ¨Åcation, the Ô¨Ånal representation using cosine\nlog-scattering (CLS) coefÔ¨Åcients is obtained by keeping only\nthe low-frequency DCT coefÔ¨Åcients as with MFCCs.

The size\nof the representation is then at most 100 coefÔ¨Åcients for\nm= 1 and380coefÔ¨Åcients for m= 2.

CLASSIFICATION\nMusic and speech classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms are often based\non MFCCs computed over 23 ms time windows. To capture\nlonger-range structures, these MFCCs are either aggregated\nin segments [1] that cover longer time intervals or are com-\nplemented with other features such as Delta-MFCCs [5].\nSophisticated GMM, HMM, AdaBoost, sparse coding clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers have been developed on such feature vectors to op-\ntimize audio classiÔ¨Åcation. The next section studies classi-\nÔ¨Åcations results obtained with simple classiÔ¨Åers to concen-\ntrate on the properties of feature vectors as opposed to a\nspeciÔ¨Åc classiÔ¨Åer.\n3.1 Musical Genre ClassiÔ¨Åcation\nThe performance of MFCC and log-scattering vectors are\ncompared for musical genre classiÔ¨Åcation, on the GTZAN\ngenre database [11]. This database includes 10genres, each\ncontaining 100clips of 30seconds each.\nDelta-MFCC coefÔ¨Åcients [5] are deÔ¨Åned as the differ-\nence between MFCC coefÔ¨Åcients of two consecutive au-\ndio frames and thus cover a time interval of twice the size.\nThese complement the ordinary MFCCs, providing infor-\nmation on the temporal audio dynamics over longer time\nintervals. The classiÔ¨Åcation performances of feature vectors\nare evaluated with an SVM classiÔ¨Åer computed with a Gaus-\nsian kernelk(x1,x2) = exp(‚àíŒ≥/bardblx1‚àíx2/bardbl2)or an afÔ¨Åne\nspace classiÔ¨Åer.\nEach audio track is decomposed in frames of duration\nTwhich are represented using MFCCs, Delta-MFCCs, or\ncosine log-scattering. A multi-class SVM is implemented\nover the audio frames with a 1vs1 approach which trains\nan SVM to discriminate each pair of classes.

Second-order CLS vectors achieve\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly higher accuracy since they recover lost non-\nstationary structure of the signal. Delta-MFCC perform bet-\nter than regular MFCCs, but are outperformed by CLS vec-\ntors which provide richer representations. With increasing\nT, the error decreases as larger-scale musical information is\nencoded, yielding the lowest error of 18% forT= 1.5 s\nwith an SVM. At larger time scales, however, classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion suffers since even second-order CLS vectors are un-\nable to accurately represent the signal, as seen during recon-\nstruction. Incorporating third-order scattering coefÔ¨Åcients\n(m= 3) marginally improves the classiÔ¨Åcation results while\ngreatly increasing the computational load.\nState-of-the-art results on GTZAN are obtained with clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers better adapted than SVMs. These classiÔ¨Åers can also\nbe applied to CLS vectors to improve classiÔ¨Åcation results.\nWith MFCCs on 23 ms and other local features, an Ad-\naBoost classiÔ¨Åer yields an error of 17% in [1]. The cascade\nÔ¨Ålter bank of cortical representations in [10], which is simi-\nlar to a scattering representation, yields an error of 7.6%[9]\nwith a sparse coding classiÔ¨Åer.\n4. CONCLUSION\nScattering representations are shown to provide complemen-\ntary co-occurence information which reÔ¨Ånes MFCC descrip-\ntors. We demonstrated that second-order scattering coefÔ¨Å-\ncients can bring an important improvement over MFCCs for\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. The ability to characterize non-stationary sig-\nnal structures opens the possibility to discriminate more so-\nphisticated phenomena such as transients, time-varying Ô¨Ål-\nters and rhythms with co-occurrence scattering coefÔ¨Åcients,\nwhich is not possible with MFCCs. It opens a wide range of\napplications for music and speech signal processing.5. REFERENCES\n[1] J. Bergstra, N. Casagrande, D. Erhan, D. Eck, and\nB.

The system uses a database with real\nsongs and does not need another type of symbolic represen-\ntation of them. The system employs an original Ô¨Ångerprint\nbased on chroma vectors to characterize the humming and\nthe references songs. With this Ô¨Ångerprint, it is possible t o\nget the hummed songs without needed of transcription of the\nnotes of the humming or of the songs. The system showed\na good performance on Pop/Rock and Spanish folk music.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, along with the development of Internet, peo -\nple can access to a huge amount of contents like music. The\ntraditional information retrieval systems are text-based but\nthis might not be the best approach for music. There is a\nneed for retrieving the music based on its musical content,\nsuch as humming the melody, which is the most natural way\nfor users to make a melody based query [3].\nQuery by humming systems are having a great expansion\nand their use is integrated not only in computer but also in\nsmall devices like mobile phones [10]. A query by hum-\nming system can be considered as an integration of three\nmain stages: construction of songs database, transcriptio n of\nusers‚Äô melodic information query and matching the queries\nwith songs in the database [5].\nFrom the Ô¨Årst query by humming system [3] to nowa-\ndays, many systems have appeared. Most of these systems\nuse Midi representation of the songs [2], [6], [9] or they pro -\ncess the songs to obtain a symbolic representation of the\nmain voice [8] or, also, these systems may use special for-\nmats such as karaoke music [11] or other hummings [7] to\nobtain the Midi or other symbolic representation [9] of the\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval .main voice of the songs in the database. In all the cases the\nmain voice or main melody must be obtained because it is\nthe normal content of the humming. Somehow, the normal\nquery by humming systems are based on the melody tran-\nscription of the humming queries [5], [7], [11] to be com-\npared with the main voice melody obtained from the songs\nin the database.\nThe approach employed in this paper is rather different\nfrom other proposals that can be found in the literature. The\ndatabase contains real stereo songs (CD quality). These\nsongs are processed in order to enhance the main voice.\nThen, the humming as well as the signal with the main voice\nenhanced, follow the same process: Ô¨Ångerprints of the hum-\nming and of the main voice are obtained. In this process, it\nis not necessary to obtain the onset or the exact tone of the\nsound, so, this Ô¨Ångerprint is a robust representation for th e\nimprecise humming or main voice enhancement.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will present\na general overview of the proposed method. Section 3 will\npresent the method of enhancement of the main voice of a\nstereo sound Ô¨Åle. Next, section 4 will propose the Ô¨Ånger-\nprint used to compare the humming and the songs. Section 5\nwill present the comparison and search methods used in the\nproposed system. Section 6 will present some performance\nresults and Ô¨Ånally, Section 7 draws some conclusions.\n2. OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED METHOD\nIn this section, a general overview of the structure of the\nhumming method for MIR is given. Figure 1 shows the\ngeneral structure of the proposed method in which both the\nhumming and the songs with the main voice enhanced fol-\nlow the same process.\nAs Figure 1 shows, a phrase fragmentation is needed for\nthe songs. The reason for this is the following: when people\nsing or hum after hearing a song, they normally sing certain\nmusical phrases, not random parts of the songs [11]. So, the\nmain voice enhancement will be performed in the phrases\nof the songs. The result of the main voice enhancement\nof the phrases of the songs and the humming pass through\na preprocessing stage that obtains a representation of thes e\n49Poster Session 1\n/g44/g437/g373/g373/g349/g374/g336 /;###\n/g87/g396/g286/g393/g396/g381/g272/g286/g400/g400/g349/g374/g336 /;### /g87/g396/g286/g393/g396/g381/g272/g286/g400/g400/g349/g374/g336 /;###\n/g38/g349/g374/g336/g286/g396/g87/g396/g349/g374/g410/;###\n/g272/g258/g367/g272/g437/g367/g258/g410/g349/g381/g374/;###/g38/g349/g374/g336/g286/g396/g87/g396/g349/g374/g410/;###\n/g272/g258/g367/g272/g437/g367/g258/g410/g349/g381/g374/;###\n/;##################/g381/g373/g393/g258/g396/g349/g400/g381/g374/;###\n/g920/;###\n/g94/g286/g258/g396/g272/g346/;###/g68/g258/g349/g374/;###/g448/g381/g349/g272/g286/;###\n/g286/g374/g346/g258/g374/g272/g286/g373/g286/g374/g410/;###/g87/g346/g396/g258/g400/g286/;###\n/g296/g396/g258/g336/g373/g286/g374/g410/g258/g410/g349/g381/g374/;###/;########################/g258/g410/g258/g271/g258/g400/g286/;###/g381/g296 /;###\n/g396/g286/g258/g367/;###/g400/g381/g374/g336/g400/;###\n/g75/g396/g282/g286/g396/g286/g282/;###/g367/g349/g400/g410/;###/g381/g296/;###\n/g396/g286/g367/g286/g448/g258/g374/g410/;###/g400/g381/g374/g336/g400/;###\nFigure 1 .

The Ô¨Ångerprints are the representation used fo r\nthe comparison and search of the humming songs and hum-\nming. Note that, the proposed method does not perform any\nconversion to Midi or other symbolic music representation.\nFinally, the system provides a list of songs ordered by their\nsimilitude with the humming entry.\n3. ENHANCEMENT OF THE MAIN VOICE\nThe reference method selected to enhance the main voice is\nbased on the previous knowledge of the pan of the signal to\nenhance [1]. The database considered contains internation al\nPop/Rock and Spanish folk music. In this type of music the\nmain voice or melody of the songs is performed by a singer\nand this voice is placed in the center of the audio mix [4].\nIn Fig. 2, the general structure of the algorithm of en-\nhancement of the main voice is presented. The base of this\nalgorithm is the deÔ¨Ånition of the stereo signal produced by\na recording studio.

This selec-\ntion is a balance between temporal resolution ( 0.18s) and\nfrequency resolution ( 5Hz).\nThe panning mask, Œ®(m,k), is estimated using the me-\nthod proposed in [1], based on the difference of the ampli-\ntude of the spectrograms of the left channel ( SL(m,k))and\nright channel ( SR(m,k)). The values of Œ®(m,k)vary from\n‚àí1to1. To avoid distortions due to abrupt changes in ampli-\ntude between adjacent points of the spectrogram produced\nby the panning mask, Œ®(m,k), a Gaussian window func-\ntion is applied to Œ®(m,k)[1]:\nŒò(m,k) =ŒΩ+(1‚àíŒΩ)¬∑e‚àí1\n2Œæ(Œ®(m,k)‚àíŒ®o)2(2)\nwhereŒ®ois the panning factor to locate (from ‚àí1totally left\nand1totally right), Œæcontrols the width of the window that\nhas an inÔ¨Çuence in the distortion/interference allowed, th at\nis, the wider the window, the lower distortion but the larger\nthe interference between other sources and vice versa. ŒΩis\na Ô¨Çoor value to avoid setting spectrogram values to 0.\nThe enhancement of the main voice is made as:\nSvc(m,k) = (SL(m,k)+SR(m,k))¬∑Œò(m,k)¬∑Œ≤(3)\nwhereSvc(m,k)is the spectrogram of the signal with the\nmain voice enhanced. Once the spectrogram Svc(m,k)is\nobtained, the reverse spectrogram is calculated to obtain t he\nwaveform of the enhanced main voice (Figure 2).\n5012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nThe parameters of equation 2, have been set experimen-\ntally to achieve a good result in our humming method. The\nselected values are: ŒΩ= 0.15,Œ®o= 0 due to the fact that\nthe desired source is in the center of the mix and Œæis calcu-\nlated with the following equation:\nŒæ=‚àíŒ®c‚àíŒ®2\no\n20logA(4)\nwhereŒ®c= 0.2is the margin around Œ®owhere the mask\nwill have an amplitude Asuch that 20logA=‚àí60dB[1].\nThere are several conditions that are going to negatively\naffect the localization of the main voice; the overlapping o f\nsources with the same panning and the addition of digital\neffects, like reverberation. However, since the aim of the\nproposed method is just the enhancement of the main voice,\ncertain level of interference can be allowed to avoid distor -\ntions in the waveform of the main voice.\n0 2 4 6 8 10‚àí0.4‚àí0.3‚àí0.2‚àí0.100.10.20.30.4\nTime [s]Amplitude [V]\n(a) Left channel of an stereo\nsignal0 2 4 6 8 10‚àí0.4‚àí0.3‚àí0.2‚àí0.100.10.20.3\nTime [s]Amplitude [V]\n(b) Right channel of an stereo\nsignal\n0 2 4 6 8 10‚àí0.25‚àí0.2‚àí0.15‚àí0.1‚àí0.0500.050.10.150.20.25\nTime [s]Amplitude [V]\n(c) Original main voice signal\nwithout any mixer0 2 4 6 8 10‚àí1‚àí0.8‚àí0.6‚àí0.4‚àí0.200.20.40.60.81\nTime [s]Amplitude [V]\n(d) Signal with the enhace-\nment of the main voice\nFigure 3 .

In subsection 4.1,\nthe preprocessing stage is presented and then, in subsectio n\n4.2, the estimation of the chroma matrix, the Ô¨Ångerprint, is\npresented.\n4.1 Preprocessing of humming and music database\nIn the preprocessing, the Ô¨Årst step consists on calculate th e\nspectrum of the whole signal, to determine the threshold.\nThe threshold is Ô¨Åxed to the 75thpercentile of the values of\nthe power spectrum. This threshold determines the spec-\ntral components with enough power to belong to a voice\nfragment. Now, the signal is windowed without overlap-\nping with a Hamming window of 8192 samples. For each\nwindow the spectrum is computed. Then, we select the fre-\nquency range from 82Hzto1046Hz, that corresponds to\nE2toC6, because this is a normal range for signing voice.\nIn this range, a peaks detection procedure is performed.\nThe local maxima and minima are located and the ascend-\ning and descending slopes are calculated. We consider sig-\nniÔ¨Åcative peaks the maxima detected over the threshold that\npresent an ascending or descending slope larger than or equa l\nto the25% of the maximum slope found. Between these\npeaks, the four peaks with larger power are selected to rep-\nresent the tonal distribution of the window. Ideally, the fo ur\npeaks selected should correspond to the fundamental fre-\nquency and the Ô¨Årst three harmonics of the signing note. The\nnumber of peaks has been restricted to four because the ob-\njective is just to gather information of the main voice (mono -\nphonic sound), which has several interferences from other\nsound sources, or because of the enhacement process of the\nmain voice (Section 3). If we selected more peaks, these\npeaks would corresponding to other notes different from the\nnotes sung by the main voice and then, the comparison with\n51Poster Session 1\nthe humming would be worse. In Fig. 5, an example of this\nprocess is shown.\n200 400 600 800 1000 120000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91\nFrequency [Hz]Normalized power spectrum\n  \nPower spectrum\nLocal maximum\nLocal minimum\nDetected peaks\nThreshold\nFigure 5 . Example of peaks selected.\nNext, the new signal spectrum that contains just the se-\nlected peaks, is simpliÔ¨Åed making use of the Midi numbers.\nThe frequency axis is converted to Midi numbers, using:\nMIDI= 69+12 log2/parenleftbiggf\n440/parenrightbigg\n(5)\nwhere MIDI is the Midi number corresponding to the fre-\nquencyf. The simpliÔ¨Åcation consists of assigning to each\nof the selected peaks the nearest Midi number. When two\nor more peaks are Ô¨Åxed to the same Midi number, only the\npeak with the largest value is taken into account. The sim-\npliÔ¨Åed spectrum is represented by Xs(n). In our case, the\nÔ¨Årst element of the simpliÔ¨Åed spectrum, Xs(1), represents\nthe spectral amplitude of the note E2, that corresponds with\nthe frequency 82Hz(Midi number 40). Likewise, the last\nelement of the simpliÔ¨Åed spectrum, Xs(45), represent the\nspectral amplitude of then note C6, that corresponds to the\nfrequency 1046Hz(Midi number 84).\n4.2 Chroma matrix\nNow, to obtain the Ô¨Ångerprint of each signal, the chroma ma-\ntrix, the chroma vector is computed for each temporal win-\ndow. The chroma vector is a 12-dimensional vector (from\nCtoB) obtained by the sum of the spectral amplitudes for\neach tone, spawning through the notes considered (from E2\ntoC6). Eachk‚àíthelement of the chroma vector, with\nk‚àà {1,2,¬∑¬∑¬∑,12}of the window, t, is computed as fol-\nlows:\nchroma t(k) =3/summationdisplay\ni=0Xs((k+7)mod12+12¬∑i+1) (6)\nThe chroma vectors for each temporal window tare com-\nputed and stored in a matrix denominated chroma matrix,C. The chroma matrix has 12rows and a column for each\nof the temporal windows of the signal analyzed.\nIn order to unify the dimensions of all the chroma matri-\nces of all the phrase fragments of the songs and humming,\nthe matrix is interpolated. To perform the interpolation, t he\nnumber of selected columns is 86, this value corresponds,\napproximately, to 16seconds. This number of columns has\nbeen selected taking into account the length of the phrase\nfragments of the songs in the database and the reasonable\nduration of the humming.

Now, the task is to Ô¨Ånd the song in the database that\nis the most similar to a certain humming. To this end, the\nÔ¨Ångerprint of the humming is obtained, then, the search for\nthe most similar Ô¨Ångerprint is made. This search is based\non the deÔ¨Ånition of the distance between the Ô¨Ångerprint of\nthe humming signal and the Ô¨Ångerprints of the songs in the\ndatabase.\nThe objective is to create a distance vector with length\nequal to the number of phrase fragments in the database.\nThen, a list of ordered songs from the most similar song to\nthe less similar one can be obtained. The distance between\nÔ¨Ångerprints is computed using:\nDstk(Chumm,Ck) =median({dkj}) (7)\ndkj=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble¬ØFhumm\nj‚àí¬ØFk\nj/vextenddouble/vextenddouble (8)\nwhereDstkis the distance of the humming to a phrase frag-\nmentk,kis the index of all the phrase fragments in the\ndatabase.

The euclidean\ndistance between columns of the Ô¨Ångerprints dkj, is calcu-\nlated. Afterwards, the median of the set of euclidean dis-\ntances,{dkj}, is stored in Dstk.\nThe distance values Dstkare ordered from the smallest\nvalue to the largest value. Now, since for each song several\nphrase fragments have been considered, the phrase closest\nto the humming is selected to deÔ¨Åne the closest songs. The\nlist of similar songs is created likewise.\nAn illustration of the utilization of the Ô¨Ångerprints to Ô¨Ånd\nsimilar songs to a given humming is shown in Figure 7. The\nÔ¨Ångerprint of a humming (Figure 7(a)), the nearest song,\nthat is, the corresponding song (Figure 7(b)) and the farthe st\nsong (Figure 7(c) ) are presented. It can be observed how the\nÔ¨Ångerprint of the humming and the corresponding song look\nvery similar. On the contrary, the Ô¨Ångerprint of the farthes t\nsong looks totally different.\n(a) Fingerprint of a humming\n(b) Fingerprint of the nearest\nsong\n(c) Fingerprint of the farthest\nsong\nFigure 7 .

RESULTS\nThe music database used in this study contained 140 songs\nextracted from commercial CDs of different genres: Pop/-\nRock and Spanish folk music. The selected phrase frag-\nments of each song are segments of 5 to 20 seconds, de-\npending on the predominant melodic line of each song.\nFor the evaluation of the system, we have used 70hum-\nmings from three male and three female users, whose ages\nare between 25and57years, and 50% of the users have mu-sical knowledge. The hummings were recorded at a sam-\npling rate of 44.1kHz and the duration of each humming\nranges from 5 to 20 seconds.\nThe retrieval performance was measured on the basis of\nSong accuracy . In general, we computed the Top-N accu-\nracy, that is the percentage of humming whose target songs\nwere among the Top‚àíNranked songs. The Top-N accu-\nracy is deÔ¨Åned as:\nTop‚àíN accuracy (%) =#Songs in Top ‚àíN\n#hummings√ó100%\n(9)\nDifferent experiments have been made to test the system ef-\nfectiveness as a function of the musical genre. The musi-\ncal genre has inÔ¨Çuence on the harmonic complexity of the\nsongs, the number of musical instruments played, the kind\nof accompaniment and the presence of rhythm instruments\nsuch as drums. All these musical aspects affect in the main\nvoice enhancement process.\nIn Table 1, the evaluation of the proposed method in the\ncomplete database, for all hummings, for 5different rank-\ning are presented. These results are rather similar to the\nones presented in [7] and [8], with the difference that our\nmethod uses real songs instead of other hummings [7] and\nour method does not need to obtain the symbolic notation of\nneither the database nor the humming [8]. Thus, a mathe-\nmatical comparison against other systems has not been pos-\nsible since other systems found do not use real audio wave-\nforms. The Table 1 also includes the Top-N accuracy for\nmusical genres: Pop/Rock and Spanish folk. It can be ob-\nserved that the performance of the system is better for the\nSpanish folk music. This is due to the fact that in this type\nof music the main voice is the most important part in the mu-\nsic and does not have digital audio effects like reverberati on,\ntherefore the main voice enhancement process performs bet-\nter.\nTable 1 .

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper a humming method for content-based music in-\nformation retrieval has been presented. The system employs\nan original Ô¨Ångerprint based on chroma vectors to character -\nize the humming and the reference songs. With this Ô¨Ånger-\nprint, it is possible to Ô¨Ånd songs similar to humming with-\nout any transcription or Midi data. The performance of the\nmethod is better in Spanish folk music, due to the main voice\nenhancement procedure in relation with the mixing style\nused in this type of music, than in Pop/Rock music. The\nmethod performance could be improved if an estimation of\nthe musical genre is included. Also, the parameters of thepanning window could be tuned for each musical genre to\nimprove the performance of the main voice enhancement.\nFinally, the system could also be made robust to transposed\nhummings, employing a set of transposed chroma matrices\nfor each humming.\n8.

INTRODUCTION\nThe interdisciplinary research area of music information re-\ntrieval (MIR) has developed from two needs: managing in-\ncreasing collections of music material in digital form, and\nsolving fundamental problems related to music analysis and\nperception [1]. Over the past decade, a wide variety of\nMIR techniques and tools have been developed using var-\nious types of music representations (audio, symbolic, vi-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.sual and metadata). However, as Cunningham [2] points\nout, they have often been designed based on anecdotal evi-\ndence, intuitive feelings, or a priori assumptions of user be-\nhaviours and needs. Without a rich understanding of the\nlatter, systems designed using MIR research might not be\nideally suited to their potential users. Bridging the gap be-\ntween the research laboratory and real-world situations is\none of the goals of this study. This requires working with\nspeciÔ¨Åc user groups in order to better understand their activ-\nity and how they interact with technologies.\nWe focused on eliciting some of the strategies used by\nmusicologists to explore musical documents, and the inter-\nactions with music-related technologies during this process.\nBonardi [3] proposed interesting solutions to improve musi-\ncologists‚Äô workstations using MIR technologies by examin-\ning their needs when analysing the contemporary catalogue\nat IRCAM‚Äôs digital library. He stated that the workstations\nshould allow various representations of music (e.g. graphi-\ncal, sound, and symbolic), listening to recordings while con-\nsulting different musical documents (‚Äòactive‚Äô listening), and\nreading (e.g. the score) and writing using the same media.\nIn this study, we sought to obtain evidence to test the\nvalidity of such statements, and whether they would be rel-\nevant in a different context (setting, different types of mu-\nsicological studies, and musical repertoires). We conducted\nan ethnographic study based on the observation of musicol-\nogists working with classical music recordings at the British\nLibrary in London. The ethnographic method is a qualita-\ntiveapproach by which Ô¨Åndings are not inferred from sta-\ntistical tests but from the detailed analysis of the behaviours\nand actions of the participants across a large number of Ô¨Åeld\nobservations. The outcomes of our research are twofold:\nthey give insights on how to adapt or improve existing digi-\ntal music technologies to Ô¨Åt user needs better (e.g. MIR tech-\nniques, software features, user interface design), and they\ncan raise ideas for the development of new systems.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-\ntion 2 presents the setting and methods of the ethnographic\nstudy. Sections 3, 4, and 5 are devoted to thematic analy-\nses based on the observations. We discuss the Ô¨Åndings in\nSection 6 and give a conclusion in Section 7.\n353Oral Session 5: User Studies\n2. SETTING AND METHODS\nVia the Edison Fellowship scheme, the British Library (BL)\nencourages musicological studies devoted to the history of\nrecordings of classical music and music in performance, by\ncreating the conditions for concentrated use of the Library‚Äôs\nrecordings collection to scholars selected on a yearly ba-\nsis. The BL‚Äôs sound archive counts more than 3.5 million\npublished and unpublished recordings of sounds and mu-\nsic including many unique historic items. In an era where\nthe Library develops the access and analysis of digitised\nrecordings, and given the close link between MIR and li-\nbrary science (e.g. representation, classiÔ¨Åcation, metadata),\nthe BL is a good setting for investigating the possible roles\nof music-related technologies in musicological research. We\ncontacted four Edison Fellows with the collaboration of the\nBL‚Äôs music department staff, and obtained their consent to\nparticipate in the study. The names used in the Ô¨Åeldnotes\npresented throughout the article are pseudonyms. The group\nwas formed of two British and two American males (average\nage 38). Their professional activities included research and\nteaching positions (PhD in musicology, lecturer in music,\nsinging teacher), as well as performance (pianist, singer).\nTwo of them had received training in science and technol-\nogy. The musical repertoires they studied were varied: early\nmusic (e.g. medieval dance, vocal and consort music), clas-\nsical and romantic music (e.g. art songs, operas, piano solo\npieces), and contemporary music (electronic music).\nWe chose an ethnographic methodology primarily based\non participant observation [4]. One of the advantages of ob-\nserving the actions of participants performed in a concrete\nsetting is that it gives access to what people do and how\n(behaviours) rather than what people say (attitudes), the lat-\nter being obtained with other qualitative methods such as\nsurvey, questionnaire, or interviews. Furthermore, staying\nfor a relatively long period of time in the environment of\nthe group studied fosters the collection of rich details which\nwould otherwise demand a high degree of self-awareness\nand a great power of recall for people to report out of the\ncontext of the activity. To achieve this level of detail, it is\nnecessary to focus on a small number of participants. This\ntradeoff of quantity for quality is common in disciplines re-\nlying on qualitative methods (e.g. psychology) [4, 5].\nThe observations were made by focusing (i) on the pro-\ncesses underlying musicological research, and (ii) on the re-\nlationships with music-related technologies and their roles\nduring such processes. The observations took place in the\nmusic department of the BL where the Fellows had a re-\nserved desk space at their disposal. They were conducted by\none ethnographer during repeated visits (twice a week, on\naverage) over a period of three months. The observational\ndata were collected by taking Ô¨Åeldnotes using a notebook\nand pen. Due to the regulations of the British Library and\nin order to minimize disturbance to the staff, video/audio\nrecordings were not used. Ancillary sources of informationwere also used in addition to the observations. Ethnographic\ninterviews [4] occurred during the research in the Ô¨Åeld in or-\nder to shed light on speciÔ¨Åc tasks and to have a deeper under-\nstanding of the scope of the studies of the participant. Some\nof the participants‚Äô own working notes were also employed,\nwith their consent. The collected data were analysed using\nthe approach proposed in [6], which draws from methods\ndeveloped by sociologists following the grounded theory:\ncoding of the Ô¨Åeldnotes (identifying and naming speciÔ¨Åc an-\nalytic dimensions and categories), and analysis by themes\nwhich reÔ¨Çect recurrent or underlying patterns of activity.\n3. USE OF RECORDINGS\n3.1 Retrieval and metadata\nMetadata were used to facilitate the retrieval of recordings in\nthe BL‚Äôs catalogue (by using details such as the record num-\nber, the label, or the conductor‚Äôs name). Additional meta-\ndata were fetched during the listening process (see Subsec-\ntion 4.2), using various sources of information: the knowl-\nedge of the Library‚Äôs curators, the web, the recordings‚Äô car-\nriers, liner notes, or accompanying manuscript documents\n(e.g. a paper card system that an original collector had kept).\n3.2 Format and playback technologies\nThe recordings already digitized were immediately accessi-\nble through the British Library Sound Server as MP3 Ô¨Åles.\nWhen the recordings were unique or held on fragile for-\nmats (e.g. reel to reel tapes), the Fellows were provided with\nanalog copies of the recordings or digitized versions on au-\ndio CDs, or less commonly, VHS tapes (PCM). The ana-\nlog formats included reel to reel tapes, compact audio cas-\nsette (K7), as well as long-playing (LP) and 78 rpm discs.\nThe recordings held on a physical support were played us-\ning dedicated playback equipment connected to an ampli-\nÔ¨Åer. The MP3 Ô¨Åles from the Sound Server were played from\nthe desktop computer using Windows Media Player Clas-\nsic. In some cases, they also listened to and analysed owned\ncommercial recordings with their laptops using iTunes to\nplay recordings, and Sonic Visualiser1as a player and anal-\nysis tool (see Subsection 4.2). For some of the Fellows, the\nformat was not an issue since they were interested in the\ncontent of the recordings and not the carrier itself. In that\ncase, they were not bothered by use of MP3 Ô¨Åles rather than\nuncompressed digital or original analog recordings. On the\ncontrary, digital recordings were preferred because the navi-\ngation in recordings was made easier and quicker. However,\nothers preferred to deal with recordings in their original for-\nmat ( ‚ÄúThere is more context when you have the original, the\nlabels, how it was held for instance. With most MP3s you\ndo lose something. I do wonder whether sometimes you‚Äôre\nlosing the core product. ‚Äù ).\n1http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/\n35412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4. LISTENING AND OBSERVING\n4.1 Listening practices\nThe listening process lay at the center of the study of the\nrecordings. The musicologists commonly alternated two\ndistinct but complementary practices of listening. In the\nÔ¨Årst listening practice, the analysis of the recordings was\nperformed exclusively through aural observations. The sec-\nond listening practice was multimodal and characterised by\nan interactivity with musical, textual or visual documents\nenriching or modifying the aural observations.\n4.1.1 Closed listening\nClosed listening was characterised by a careful and focused\nlistening to the recording without using any other source of\ninformation than that provided by the sound: William put\nhis headphones on to listen to Telemann‚Äôs Concerto in F for\n3 recorders, 2 oboes, 2 violins, and continuo, performed by\nthe Early Music Consort. After starting the recording in the\nCD player, he sat back in his chair, closed his eyes, and lis-\ntened carefully to the music. A moment later, I noticed that\nhe was tapping the beat with his foot. This example shows\nhow the aural experience became a physical one (tapping the\nbeat with the foot) while retrieving information about the\ntiming of the musical piece (tempo). In the closed listening\nmode, the musicologists drew aural observations involving\nperceptual and cognitive aspects (a recollection of the score,\nfor instance). Either in parallel or shortly after the listening\nprocess, they wrote down their aural observations by hand\nor using a text editor. Typed notes had the advantage that\nthey could be queried quickly by using keywords such as\nthe name of a composer.\n4.1.2 Multimodal listening\nA different practice was characterised by the use of vari-\nous music-related documents (e.g. the biography of a com-\nposer, information on the recording) and music represen-\ntations (e.g. scores, feature visualisations) while listening.\nThis listening practice can be described as an active pro-\ncess [3], since it does not just consist of receiving musical\ninformation, but is on the contrary based on a set of mul-\ntimodal interactions between the listeners and musical doc-\numents. The advantages of using multiple modalities were\nan increased access to meaning, uncovering the context of\na recording and the intentions of composers, conductors, or\nperformers, and better understanding of the perception of\nthe music. Multimodal listening was performed by varying\nthe media and technologies used to document the musical\nrecordings.4.2 Documenting the music recordings\n4.2.1 Contextual information\nIn the multimodal listening practice, the musicologists com-\nmonly used web resources to seek several types of informa-\ntion related to the recordings: contextual (Ô¨Ånding metadata\nabout a musical piece, for instance), bibliographic (music\nartists‚Äô websites, Wikipedia), as well as visual and icono-\ngraphic (YouTube videos were sometimes used to uncover\nvisual aspects of performance, Google Images was used to\nprovide pictures of speciÔ¨Åc musicians). Such resources were\nalso used without listening to the recordings.\n4.2.2 Scores and lyrics\nThe online music sheet database from the International Mu-\nsic Score Library Project2was often used to retrieve public\ndomain editions of scores, which are provided as scanned\nimages in PDF format. Some of the musicologists read the\nscore using a printed copy, while others used the electronic\nformat and followed the music with the mouse while listen-\ning. When they were available, scores were used both in\norder to retrieve general information such as the key of a\npiece, and more detailed information through a close analy-\nsis of the notes and expressive notation. Singing while read-\ning the score was sometimes used to Ô¨Ånd the scale used by\nthe composer (e.g. Lydian mode). Scores acted as a refer-\nence against which to test whether the intentions of the com-\nposer were respected by performers, as the following notes\nshow: ‚ÄúSeems really consistent with markings in the score.\nBeautifully sung - singing the note values and generally the\ndynamics written by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. ‚Äù ,‚ÄúIs much\nfreer with the interpretation of the score. Interpolates a high\nnote at the end and changes the melodic line at the end of\nthe song. ‚Äù In the case of vocal music compositions, reading\nthe lyrics while listening also helped to follow the musical\nstructure and to understand the expression, as shown in this\nnote describing the timbre of the performer‚Äôs tones by ref-\nerence to the lyrics rather than the pitch: ‚Äúquite shrill and\nshaky on ‚ÄòA wind comes and let me be‚Äô, and more mellow\non ‚Äòsaid it slow‚Äô. ‚Äù\n4.2.3 Sound visualisation, acoustical analyses, and\ntime-stretching\nMusicologists with previous background in music technolo-\ngies (coming either from their education, personal training,\nor from collaboration with computer scientists) also used\nsoftware (Sonic Visualiser) to analyse and visualise music\nrecordings. The visualisation of the waveform was help-\nful to navigate digital recordings by jumping between sec-\ntions that have different dynamics (e.g. between a spoken\npart and the start of an orchestral part, for instance). Spec-\ntrogram representations were used to analyse the subtleties\nof expressive effect such as the vibrato: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm looking at\n2http://www.imslp.org/\n355Oral Session 5: User Studies\na waveform [the one from a tone‚Äôs partial] and I can see\nthere is vibrato in the note, I hear it much better‚Äù . Such\nacoustical analyses helped to understand the perceptual ef-\nfects experienced when listening: ‚ÄúThe spectrogram shows\nyou that the real skill to her [Emma Kirkby‚Äôs] vibrato use\nis that the note starts with very very minimal vibrato. So\nyour mind is fed a very accurate pitch, before the pitch is\nthen decorated by vibrato. So that‚Äôs why you hear it as such\na pure voice, because she‚Äôs already told you the informa-\ntion about exactly what the note is before it vibrates, so your\nbrain somehow keeps on that central tuning issue during the\nvibration [...] Whereas singers that immediately start with\nvibrato, you can never really tell what they‚Äôre singing. ‚Äù\nAcoustical measurements were performed from the spec-\ntrogram representations (a measure tool is provided in Sonic\nVisualiser) in order to characterise the properties of vibrato\n(frequency, and pitch extent). These measurements were\nconducted in a systematic way for various performers by\ncomparing long sustained notes. The resulting quantitative\ndata gave clues to understand or nuance aural observations\nmade on vibrato by other musicologists: ‚ÄúThe minimal vi-\nbrato sounds that Munrow listed [...] were all faster and\nshallower than the other examples of vibrato. When this is\ncombined with Munrow‚Äôs own explicit disapproval of con-\nstant vibrato, we begin to understand that he is suggesting a\npreference for ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô vibrato‚Äù.\nThe time-stretching technique provided by Sonic Visu-\naliser which preserves the original pitch and timbre was also\nused to produce slowed-down versions of notes or musical\npassages. These slowed-down excerpts were played while\nvisualising scrolling spectrogram representations giving the\ntime to the ear and the eye to uncover Ô¨Åne details: ‚ÄúI knew\nsomething was up through listening but I couldn‚Äôt tell what\nwas up, and then when I visualised ... when I slowed down,\nmore of it made sense, I realised the vibrato was not consis-\ntent, but I couldn‚Äôt work out that it started without vibrato\nwithout the spectrogram‚Äù . Spectrogram analyses and time-\nstretching were also used to validate intuitions obtained with\naural observations to explain the technique and expression\nof a pianist. By looking at the alignment of the notes on the\nspectrogram while listening to a slowed-down passage, sub-\ntle differences of timing between chord notes played by the\nleft and the right hands were noticed.\n5. MUSICAL FEATURES\n5.1 Instrumentation and tuning\nDetails about the instrumentation were retrieved in several\nways: from the recordings‚Äô metadata, from the announcer\nin the case of broadcast music programmes, or by ear when\nlistening to a musical piece. The choice of instrumentation\nwas an important aspect in the study of historically informed\nperformances of early music (e.g. choice of epoch instru-\nments rather than modern ones), especially since early mu-sic scores do not indicate instruments. The recognition of\nmodern versus epoch instruments in musical performances\nwas not a trivial process to perform aurally ( ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming\nthese are modern instruments, 440 etc. ‚Äù ). Similarly, iso-\nlating a speciÔ¨Åc instrument amongst an ensemble (e.g. the\nviolin in a string ensemble: ‚Äú‚ÄòQuan je voy le duc‚Äô - most at-\ntractive instrumental piece of collection but horrid scratchy\nstring playing, Ô¨Åddle?‚Äù ), or retrieving the number of musi-\ncians playing a part in a speciÔ¨Åc register ( ‚ÄúTwo sopranos?‚Äù )\nwere not easy tasks. The tuning of the instruments was also\nused to judge musical interpretations (e.g. ‚ÄúLamento della\nNymfa particularly telling with too many harpsichords I feel\n- each one slightly out of tune. ‚Äù ,‚ÄúTuning of violins not great\nin second track‚Äù ).\n5.2 Musical expression\nVarious musical features correlated to musical expression\nwere recurrently analysed, including: dynamics (e.g. ‚ÄúDeller\nusing great sweeping phrases with many dynamic nuances. ‚Äù ),\ntiming (e.g. tapping the beat while listening to increase the\nsensation of the tempo, measuring the duration of a perfor-\nmance, detailed analyses of pianists‚Äô hand asynchronies us-\ning spectrograms), timbre (e.g. ‚ÄúWhen she sings softer, she\ndoesn‚Äôt have the same quality. The notes sound mellower. ‚Äù ),\npitch (e.g. ‚ÄúThe King‚Äôs Singers‚Äô style hasn‚Äôt changed much\nbut alto sound is Ô¨Çat!‚Äù ), vocal style (e.g. ‚ÄúOverabundance\nof rolled ‚ÄòR‚Äôs - stylistically ok, but a bit obtrusive in an oth-\nerwise beautiful rendition. ‚Äù ), vibrato (e.g. ‚ÄúDeller consort\nstill has a lot of vibrato in tenor(s) but very good ensem-\nble singing. ‚Äù ), and phrasing (e.g. ‚ÄúReminiscent of baroque\nphrasing rather than renaissance. ‚Äù ).\nMusical expression was analysed either by considering\na speciÔ¨Åc performer (e.g. the singer Deller), or by consid-\nering an ensemble (e.g. the King‚Äôs Singers, the tenors), by\nfocusing on the notes, or on phrases, the latter showing the\nuse of different time scales in the analyses. Some features\nwere more difÔ¨Åcult to describe solely based on aural obser-\nvations than others. If dynamics variations seemed to be\neasily perceived, some variations of pitch and timbre were\nmore difÔ¨Åcult to detect conÔ¨Ådently (e.g. ‚ÄúNot sure it stays\nin tune too well, sinking over the whole perf, less than a\nsemi. ‚Äù ,‚ÄúMay be because of the choice of quality for notes\nof the same pitch on two different pieces, the voice doesn‚Äôt\nsound the same: it doesn‚Äôt sound as shrill as it did on the G.\nMay be due to the key D /flat.‚Äù). Often the expertise of the musi-\ncologists as performers was employed to Ô¨Ånd causal expla-\nnations of sound effects based on instrumental techniques:\nsingers were able to associate vocal timbre variations with\nthe vocal technique used to produce them ( ‚ÄúDeller seems\nto use chest voice for the second, lower, ‚ÄòZion‚Äô. ‚Äù ), pianists\nwere able to detect timing effects between notes by focusing\non the hand technique (hand asynchrony in chords) charac-\nteristic of the style of the performer. Musical expression was\nalso described in a critical way by using aesthetic judgments\n35612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(‚ÄúSoprano sound is rather lovely it must be said‚Äù ,‚Äú‚Äòdes-\nolata‚Äô is quite seasick‚Äù ,‚ÄúI love the bottom of her voice‚Äù ,\n‚ÄúBeautiful - very clear rendition‚Äù ,‚ÄúVery rousing and exhil-\narating rendition by Webster Booth‚Äù ).\n6. DISCUSSION\n6.1 Visualisation and computational analysis enrich the\nempirical evidence\nEven though, as educated and expert listeners, musicolo-\ngists were able to perceive extremely Ô¨Åne details, visuali-\nsation and computational analysis conveyed empirical ev-\nidence which helped them to conÔ¨Årm and prove aural ob-\nservations ( ‚ÄúThe tools on one hand, I don‚Äôt need them, I\ncould describe that, on the other hand I can‚Äôt prove it. This\ntool [Sonic Visualiser] is allowing me to express that in\nsome way it [the Ô¨Ånding] is objective. ‚Äù ). As put forward by\nCook [7], computational methods bring the potential for mu-\nsicology to be pursued as a more data-rich discipline. The\nobservations reported in Subsection 4.2.3 show the utility\nof multiple sources of information to analyse music perfor-\nmance practices. Visualisations and quantitative data re-\ntrieved through signal measurements were helpful in dis-\ncussing, interpreting, or proving hypotheses about qualita-\ntive data collected through aural observations. Furthermore,\nthese analyses enabled systematic comparison of the mu-\nsical expression of various performers in different musical\npieces (e.g. measurement of the rate and extent of the vi-\nbrato on long sustained notes based on spectrogram analy-\nses) and led to explanations of expressive techniques which\ncould not be reached through aural observations alone ( ‚ÄúYou\ncan only hear the pitch aspect of the vibrato as an educated\nlistener with no software or technology. ‚Äù ).\n6.2 Cross-modal effects exist between auditory and\nvisual feedback\nMany of the examples given in Subsection 4.2.3 also show\nthat the visualisation and listening processes (either at the\noriginal speed or using slowed playback) affect each other.\nFor example, the spectrogram helps to hear vibrato much\nbetter, the slowed playback of a tone helps to uncover that\nthe vibrato is not constant, while the spectrogram aids in\nunderstanding that the variation comes from the fact that the\nnote starts without vibrato. Hence, new empirical evidence\nemerges from the cross-modal effects between auditory and\nvisual feedback. Visualisation was described by one of the\nFellows as a ‚Äúlearning process‚Äù ( ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôve seen the spec-\ntrogram, I can only hear it [the vibrato], it‚Äôs there now ...\nin my understanding. ‚Äù). However, cross-modal effects be-\ntween auditory and visual feedback also raise a paradox: if\nvisualisation brings to the aural experience an ‚Äúincreased\nemphasis on what you can see‚Äù , it concomitantly ‚Äúdeem-\nphasises what you can‚Äôt see‚Äù . Therefore the ear may dis-card relevant aspects when the eye focuses on a spectrogram\nrepresentation while listening. After performing analyses\nbased on spectrograms, one Fellow noted ‚ÄúI completely for-\ngot about the bassoon, it feels like it is unimportant now,\nbut I was once struck by it. ‚Äù . For this reason, being able to\nlisten to a musical piece at Ô¨Årst without visuals was deemed\nto be important, otherwise visualisation may ‚Äúirreversibly\nedit stuff out of your brain that you can‚Äôt see‚Äù . The design-\ners and users of music feature visualisation software need to\nbe aware of cross-modal interactions which might affect the\nobjectivity of their observations [8].\n6.3 Software for musicologists should support closed\nand multimodal listening practices\nWe suggest that software designed for assisting musicolo-\ngists in their analyses of recordings should be in line with\ntheir listening practices by supporting both closed and mul-\ntimodal listening. Due to the cross-modal effects mentioned\nin the previous section, it would be helpful for the user in-\nterface Ô¨Årst to provide a closed listening mode without visu-\nals, and then offer the possibility of switching to a more ad-\nvanced listening mode offering multimodal feedback. The\nmultimodal mode should link the music documents and rep-\nresentations using aural, visual, textual, and symbolic in-\nformation (see Subsection 4.2). Different software or user\ninterfaces may be needed to handle primary (e.g. scores and\nsound visualisations) and secondary (e.g. music biographies)\ninformation sources.\nOne way of providing textual and visual information re-\nlated to a recording (e.g. metadata, pictures) is via semantic\nweb technologies. Linked data offer promising ways to fa-\ncilitate the retrieval of metadata describing the recordings\n(date, album art covers, etc.) and the musicians (biogra-\nphies, photos, etc.). In addition to visualisations of acoustic\nparameters (see Subsections 4.2.3 and 6.1), the visualisation\nof scores and/or lyrics within the software would facilitate\nthe analysis of music recordings. Semantic web technolo-\ngies may also provide ways to retrieve scores from online\ndatabases directly from the audio player. Scores could then\nbe used as a reference to compute the performers‚Äô expres-\nsive deviations using content-based MIR techniques. The\nvisualisation of expressive deviations could help musicolo-\ngists to determine the extent to which expressive markings\nin the score are followed in the performance (see the note\nmentioned earlier: ‚ÄúSeems really consistent with markings\nin the score. ‚Äù ), and to characterise the artistic intentions of\nthe conductor and/or performers.\nBased on the observations reported in Subsection 4.2,\nthe alignment of scores, lyrics or other time-based meta-\ndata to audio recordings could also aid performance prac-\ntice analysis, by facilitating multimodal listening and pro-\nviding better navigation of audio documents. For annota-\ntion of recordings, the inclusion of text editing function-\nality into analysis and playback software would be a wel-\n357Oral Session 5: User Studies\ncome feature, since musicologists generally write down ob-\nservations while listening. This could indeed be a means to\nconnect notes up with the actual point-in-time of the mu-\nsic which would ease further proof-reading or enrichment\nof the notes. Controlling the audio playback, with either the\nkeyboard or with a transcription foot pedal, would facilitate\ntasks such as the transcription of interviews from broadcast\nrecordings including speech and music, and avoid the con-\nstant switches between various computer software or differ-\nent devices which are time-consuming ( ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so irritating\ntranscribing from a computer Ô¨Åle because you‚Äôre also try-\ning to write on the same computer, so you have to keep go-\ning into that program to move the recording back a bit, go\nback to the word program to type up that sentence more ac-\ncurately. So [...] if it‚Äôs my Ô¨Åle on my iPod, I can start and\nstop using a different device than the computer, or here I‚Äôm\nusing the CD player. ‚Äù ).\n6.4 Can content-based MIR aid musicological study?\nSeveral areas of content-based MIR are relevant for musico-\nlogical purposes. For instance, automatic speech/music seg-\nmentation would help the navigation between spoken and\nmusic parts of documentaries and other broadcast material.\nSpeech recognition software would also be of considerable\nhelp to automatically transcribe interviews, enabling search\nof the non-music audio segments for conversations about\nspeciÔ¨Åc topics or musicians. Regarding the analysis of per-\nformance practices, automatic source separation techniques\ncould facilitate separate analysis of the musical expression\nof different performers or groups of performers (see Sec-\ntion 5.2). Variations of timbre are more difÔ¨Åcult to qualify\naurally than other variations such as in timing. Therefore\nMIR techniques improving timbre characterisation (e.g. at\nthe note level) and identiÔ¨Åcation of instrumentation or per-\nformers could help answer questions like: ‚ÄúIs that Janita\nusing some vibrato in the solos?‚Äù\n7. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we presented and analysed ethnographic ob-\nservations of musicologists studying classical music record-\nings. The observed patterns revealed the importance of: (i)\nthe alternation of closed and multimodal listening modes;\n(ii) the use of visualisation and computational methods to\nprovide empirical evidence about listeners‚Äô impressions; (iii)\nscores and lyrics acting as a reference in performance analy-\nsis; and (iv) web sites and speech recordings supplying his-\ntorical and extra-musical information.\nThese Ô¨Åndings give clues regarding how to improve soft-\nware designed for musicologists. Such software should both\nsupport closed and multimodal listening, minimising dis-\ntractions and allowing the user to decide on the display of\nany feature visualisations during listening. The features ofinterest for computer-assisted musicology are those charac-\nterising artistic choices such as performers‚Äô expressive in-\ntentions (e.g. tuning, temperament, timing, pitch, timbre,\ndynamics, articulation and vibrato), most usefully displayed\nin conjunction with scores and lyrics. Content-based meta-\ndata soniÔ¨Åcation should be handled to facilitate the interpre-\ntation of the features (e.g. pitch). Interfaces managing the\nretrieval of contextual information (e.g. metadata, biogra-\nphies, articles, pictures) during multimodal listening would\nbeneÔ¨Åt the historical approach to musicology. Linked data\noffers a promising way to connect such extra-musical in-\nformation with the recordings by exploiting web resources\nsuch as the open music encyclopedia MusicBrainz3.\n8.

In the clinical setting, care providers can suffer from alarm fatigue, a condition in which audible alarms in an operating room are perceived as a nuisance. In this study, we explore the auditory features associated with current audible alarms using tools from the music information retrieval communi-ty, and then we examine how those auditory features corre-late to listeners‚Äô perception of urgency. The results show that aperiodic changes in the auditory spectrum over time are the most salient contributor to the perception of urgen-cy in sound. These results could inform the development of a novel standard regarding the composition of medical au-dible alarms. 1. INTRODUCTION The need to reevaluate audible medical alarms has been identified by several organizations, including The Joint Commission (www.jointcommission.org, the accreditation and certification organization of U.S. hospitals), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov), the Anes-thesia Patient Safety Foundation (www.apsf.org), and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (www.asahq.org). Serious errors associated with audible medical alarm per-ception have also received much recent press [1‚Äì4]. Previ-ous attempts have been made by the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) to standardize these alarms by providing normative and informative guidelines [5]. These recommendations stipulated that alarms should consist of a series of pulsed tones, each forming a three-note melody.  Under IEC guidelines, melodies are reserved for one of several sentinel events for two levels of priority: caution-ary and emergency. Emergency status, which is meant to Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that cop-ies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval   engender a greater sense of urgency in the listener, is dif-ferentiated from cautionary status by simply lengthening and repeating the melodies and increasing the tempo. However, several previous studies have suggested that the-se IEC alarms are ineffective at conveying the appropriate level of urgency and are difficult to learn [6‚Äì8]. Worse yet, these alarms are often perceived as a nuisance in the in-traoperative environment, often leading to physicians‚Äô manual silencing of audible alarms, which presents a po-tentially serious patient safety issue [9]. In this study, we sought to observe the acoustic features of audible alarms currently used in intraoperative environ-ments. Because alarm sounds vary by equipment manufac-turer, the current IEC-recommended alarms were used [5]. As mentioned, IEC alarms are differentiated by various short melodies. For example, a cardiovascular event is rep-resented by a major triad in first inversion and ventilation by a major triad in second inversion. (For a complete list of examples, see Table 1.) In addition to the IEC alarms, an experimental alarm set that incorporates additional audito-ry features besides melody and tempo was synthesized and used in this study for comparison.  Event Melody Description General 1‚àí1‚àí1 Ostinato Oxygenation 8‚àí7‚àí6 Falling pitch Ventilation 1‚àí6‚àí4 NBC chime Cardiovascular 1‚àí3‚àí5 Kumbaya Temperature 1‚àí2‚àí3 Major scale Drug Infusion 8‚àí2‚àí5 Quartal Perfusion 1‚àí4#‚àí1 Tritone Power 8‚àí1‚àí1 Octave Table 1. IEC alarms by source with melodic and descrip-tive annotations.   \n771Poster Session 6\n   The first objective of this study was to observe the primary salient auditory features of the IEC alarm set and to com-pare it to those of the experimental set. The researchers hypothesized that features would differ significantly be-tween the two sets because the IEC group uses only two auditory dimensions (melody and tempo), and the experi-mental group employs additional dimensions. The second objective was to investigate the acoustical correlates of ur-gency perception, thereby laying a foundation for a more robust and comprehensive audible medical alarm protocol. In this paper, we first present our experimental methods, followed by results and a discussion of the results. We conclude with a description of ongoing and future work. 2. METHODS 2.1 Stimuli Two sets of alarm sounds were used: IEC alarms and ex-perimental alarms. The experimental alarm set was synthe-sized by applying various audio effects to a pure-tone car-rier; we devised this second set of sounds in order to intro-duce additional auditory dimensions. These additional au-ditory effects included amplitude modulation, waveshap-ing, frequency modulation, phase randomization, and other basic sound synthesis and processing techniques. We con-structed a listening test in which alarm sounds were pre-sented to users in a random order; while listening to the alarms, users completed a simple questionnaire. Stimuli were presented once to the subject as 16-bit, 44.1-kHz WAV files and presented over two loudspeakers in a mu-sic-rehearsal space. Section 2.1 summary: IEC/ISO alarms were used as the control set and newly developed alarms as the experi-mental set.  These were played to subjects who completed a questionnaire about the alarm sounds. 2.2 Subjective Experimental Protocol A total of 21 undergraduate and graduate students in our music technology program were enrolled. Subjects were presented with eight IEC alarms and seven experimental alarms total.  Each IEC alarm was presented at both the cautionary and emergency levels, and each experimental alarm was presented at nine levels of auditory effect strength (20% to 100%, in steps of 10%). As an example of effect strength, consider amplitude modulation, in which the effect strength is determined by the modulation depth. These sounds can be found online at http://mue.music.miami.edu/soundSurvey. Subjects were asked to perceptually rate the alarms on a nine-point Likert scale [10] according to their perceived sense of urgency, anxiety, attention, and severity. These terms were prede-fined for subjects according to the definitions given in Ta-ble 2.   \nTable 2. Definitions of emotional descriptors used in the Likert questionnaire. Section 2.2 summary: Music students were asked to rate the IEC and experimental alarm sets on a Likert scale based on their perceived sense of urgency, anxiety, atten-tion, and severity.  2.3 Data Analysis Subject responses were first tested for normality by apply-ing a Lilliefors test. If the responses were tagged as being significantly different from normal distribution, then those responses were normalized using a power transformation to reduce intra-subject variability [11]. A power transform is rank-preserving but stabilizes the variance to make the distribution more Gaussian. This was useful for comparing responses across subjects. Next, inter-subject statistics were calculated to tag those responses that fell outside of ¬±3 standard deviations from the inter-subject mean. These outliers were removed from further analysis. Finally, to deal with missing responses, the intra-subject mean was used in place of an empty element for statistical computa-tions.  Section 2.3 summary: Subjects‚Äô emotional response ratings were normalized, then outliers were removed, and finally blank responses were filled in. 2.4 Auditory Feature Selection Auditory feature selection consisted of three primary phas-es: automatic feature extraction, automatic feature selec-tion, and informed feature parsing. Automatic feature ex-traction was conducted using MIRToolbox [12]. Each alarm was segmented using one-second frames, and we computed 25 common audio features for each frame. These features describe the dynamics, rhythm, spectral, timbral, and tonal characteristics of each frame. In order to make direct comparisons between features, the inter-frame statis-tics for each feature were analyzed instead of the feature Descriptor Definition Urgency A sense of requiring immediate action Anxiety A sense of apprehension due to uncer-tainty or doubt Attention A sense of drawing your focus or ob-servation Severity A sense of harshness or intensity \n77212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   vectors themselves. These statistics included mean, stand-ard deviation, slope, and periodicity.  After obtaining the feature statistics, automatic feature se-lection was performed. Features were parsed and included for consideration only if the following criteria were met: features were significant at p<0.05, features and urgency ratings had a correlation coefficient œÅ>0.25, and linear re-gression of the features against the urgency ratings pro-duced a square correlation coefficient of R2>0.25. These minimum criteria ensured that the selected auditory fea-tures would be at least moderately and reproducibly corre-lated to the four perceptual dimensions of urgency, anxiety, attention, and severity. Features were then sorted using a statistical mapping between the subjects‚Äô emotional ratings and the two sets of alarm sounds using methods developed by Lartillot, et al. [13]. Section 2.4 summary: Several auditory features were com-puted for each alarm sound. Next, these features for each alarm were compared to how that alarm was rated by the subjects on average. Features were removed if they were not significantly correlated to one of the emotional scales. The remaining features were ranked in order of correla-tion. 3. RESULTS 3.1 Subject Responses In our initial analysis of subject responses, we performed a squared multiple correlation to test for collinearity among the descriptor dimensions. The results showed that urgency was collinear (!!=0.95) with all of the other descriptors. As a result, the other descriptions (anxiety, attention, and severity) were removed from further analysis. Next, scale validity was confirmed by testing for inter-subject correlation (œÅ) and Cronbach‚Äôs Œ±. In general, œÅ in-dicates the degree of linear dependence across subjects and varies from ‚Äì1 (anti-correlated) to +1 (perfect positive cor-relation), while Œ± measures the internal consistency or agreement of a psychometric test score across a population, and it varies from 0 (inconsistent responses) to 1 (perfect consistency). A high degree of internal consistency be-tween subject responses was found, both in œÅ (0.39) as well as Œ± (0.92). Section 3.1 summary: The test methodology was validated by exhibiting consistent subject responses. ‚ÄòUrgency‚Äô was highly collinear with the remaining emotional scales, so the others were removed from further analysis.  3.2 Independent Analysis of Alarm Sets  After the combined subjective data were shown to exhibit internal consistency, we proceeded to analyze the features computed within the IEC and experimental alarm sets. The mirmap command from MIRToolbox was used to discov-er which of approximately 300 standard audio features (in-cluding statistics on feature vectors) showed strongly posi-tive or negative correlation to the mean urgency rating. Additionally, only features exhibiting statistical signifi-cance and sufficient independence (rxy>0.6) were selected. On the IEC alarm set, the only feature that correlated strongly to urgency was the magnitude of the spectral cen-troid periodicity (œÅ=0.9). For the IEC alarm set, the cardi-ovascular alarm at the emergency level exhibited the strongest perceptual urgency and the highest rhythmic at-tack slope. Analysis of the experimental data set yielded a more robust and descriptive set of correlated features. Five features ex-hibited strong correlation to mean urgency rating: standard deviation and mean of the rhythmic attack slope (i.e., var-iation in the ‚Äútransientness‚Äù over time), entropy of the ‚Äúma-jorness‚Äù/‚Äúminorness,‚Äù variation of the tonal centroid, and the mean spectral roughness. These correlations are illus-trated in Figure 1. Section 3.2 summary: IEC alarms exhibited one auditory feature correlated with urgency, and the experimental alarms exhibited five (as shown in Figure 1).  \n Figure 1. The five most significantly correlated features relating to perceived urgency in the experimental alarm set.  3.3 Post-Hoc Analysis of the Combined Alarm Set Data from the listening tests of each alarm set were then combined and analyzed together instead of separately to seek additional insights. We performed automatic feature selection by statistically mapping the combined set of fea-tures to the combined set of perceived urgency ratings. We found eleven features that met the criteria of œÅ>0.25 and p<0.05. Next, R2 values were computed by determining how linearly the feature correlated to urgency. However, after removing those features with poor R2 values, only three features remained, as shown in Figure 2: periodic en-\n773Poster Session 6\n   tropy of spectral flatness (œÅ=‚Äì0.56*, R2=0.45), standard deviation of tonal chromagram centroid (œÅ=‚Äì0.49*, R2=0.32), and standard deviation of spectral irregularity (œÅ=‚Äì0.36*, R2=0.31). Curiously, the three most correlated features in the combined data set were different than those reported by the analysis of each alarm set individually. However, of these, the standard deviation of spectral irreg-ularity ranked sixth in the IEC alarm set and fourth in the experimental alarm set. Section 3.3 summary: When the IEC and experimental alarm sets and responses were combined, it was found that three features correlated linearly with perceived urgency.  These three features were all related to the change of spec-tral characteristics over time.   \n Figure 2. Linear regression of auditory features against perceived urgency.  3.4 Multivariable Linear Regression Perceptual urgency responses were used to sort the alarms from lowest perceived urgency to highest perceived urgen-cy. The same sorting order was used for each of the three selected auditory features that were highly correlated to perceived urgency. Next, linear regression was calculated from these two data sets to produce a line of best fit (Fig-ure 2) for each feature. We performed multivariable linear regression to compute the vector of weighting coefficients, W, that best fits the equation !=!‚àô!  (1) Here, u represents the mean inter-subject urgency rating vector, where u[0] is the collective mean rating of the first alarm, and so on for every alarm sound.  The vector f con-tains the three auditory features described in ¬ß3.3, whereby f T = {SFE, SIS, TCS}, and SFE is the spectral flatness en-tropy, SIS is the spectral irregularity standard deviation, and TCS is the tonal chromagram centroid standard devia-tion.  Performing a least-squares regression results in the follow-ing weighting coefficients yields  !={7.5,‚àí2.8,‚àí0.4}.  (2) Together, SFE and SIS account for 80% of the predicted urgency. These two features were plotted against perceived urgency in a 3D scatter plot, along with a mesh of predict-ed urgency, in Figure 3.  Section 3.4 summary: An equation for predicting perceived urgency was formulated based on the three most correlated features selected from a set of hundreds of features.  The weighting coefficients for those features, W, was deter-mined.  \n Figure 3. Perceived urgency (‚Ä¢) and predicted urgency (‚Å´) are shown. Urgency can be predicted based on the auditory features of inter-frame spectral irregularity standard devia-tion and inter-frame spectral flatness entropy.  4. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK Our hypothesis that an experimental alarm set could be constructed that utilized more auditory dimensions was validated by independent objective and subjective analysis of the IEC alarm set and a new, experimental alarm set. The IEC set exhibited only one statistically significant fea-ture that correlated to user perception of urgency, whereas the experimental data set exhibited five. This indicates that a broader set of features can be considered when construct-ing audible alarms, thereby providing a larger number of ‚Äúhandles‚Äù to manipulate when constructing new alarms.  This could be a useful tool in addressing the alarm prob-lem, as it has been suggested that more heterogeneity among alarms could improve identification of alarms [14]. \n77412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   Combined analyses of both data sets indicate that changes in an alarm‚Äôs spectral features over time are the largest contributor to perceived urgency. In each case (periodic entropy of spectral flatness, standard deviation of tonal chromagram centroid, and standard deviation of spectral irregularity), the feature represents an inter-frame statistic. Furthermore, in each case, the feature is anti-correlated to urgency, indicating that fluctuating spectral content is a key to determining perceived urgency.  There are a large number of audible alarms present in the clinical arena, and many of these are false alarms.  This large number of false alarms leads to clinicians routinely ignoring them by suffering from alarm fatigue (a concept similar to listener fatigue) [15].  It has been suggested that improving the encoding of alarm information and reducing the number of false alarms could help reduce alarm fatigue [16].  This study provides the framework for establishing new audible alarms that do properly convey urgency, thus augmenting the transfer of information to the clinician. This study ties together concepts from music information retrieval, such as auditory feature selection, with auditory displays commonly found in a clinical setting. Leveraging these findings, we are currently working on a comprehen-sive syntax for operating room alarms that is able to con-vey multiple usable dimensions of data in addition to ur-gency. This might be done, for example, by mapping one auditory feature to urgency and another feature to indicate the alarm recipient (e.g., anesthesiologist, surgeon, nurse). Ultimately, we hope this work will lead to a robust alarm protocol that will minimize alarm fatigue in the operating room, thereby increasing patient safety. 5. REFERENCES [1] L.

INTRODUCTION \nGiven its numerous applications, the automatic infe rence of \nmusical structure is a key subject in MIR [1], whic h has been \nfocusing significant research effort in the past ye ars [2-10]. It \nhas also triggered several studies [11,12] and proj ects [13,14] \nsupporting this research with the investigation of methodo- \nlogical issues and the collection of annotated data . \nIn this context, the structural description approac h called de- \ncomposition into autonomous and comparable blocks  was \nrecently introduced [12] in terms of general concep ts, in- \nspired from structuralism and generativism. It has been de- \nsigned to be applicable to a wide range of ‚Äúconvent ional‚Äù \nmusic, including pop music. \nThe present follow-up paper develops further this a pproach, \nwith the purpose of facilitating the usability and the reproduci- \nbility of the method.

This paper also announces the release o f 500 an- \nnotated and partially commented music pieces in acc ordance \nwith the proposed conventions. \n2.  PROBLEM STATEMENT \n2.1  Levels of musical organization \nIt is commonly agreed that the composition and the percep- \ntion of music pieces rely on simultaneous processes  which \nvary at different timescales. Similarly to [15], we  consider \nthe three following levels corresponding to three d ifferent \nranges of timescales : \n‚Ä¢ the low-level elements which correspond to fine-gra in \nevents such as notes, beats, silences, etc‚Ä¶ We call  this \nlevel the acoustic level  and its time scale is typically be- \nlow or around 1 second. \n‚Ä¢ the mid-level organization of the musical content, based \non compositional units such as bars or hyper-bars o r on \nperceptual units such as musical cells and phrases,  rang- \ning typically between 1 and 16 seconds. We will ref er to \nthis level as the morpho-syntagmatic  level. \n‚Ä¢ the high-level structure of the musical piece, whic h de- \nscribes the long term regularities and relationship s be- \ntween its successive parts, and which we will call the lev- \nel of the semiotic structure , typically at a time scale \naround or above 16 seconds. \nThe figure of section 6 provides an illustration of  these three \nlevels. Note that we use the term semiotic  in a quite restricted \nscope, (compared for instance to that of Nattiez [1 6]) as de- \nnoting the high-level symbolic  and metaphoric  representation \nof musical content 1. \n2.2  Semiotic structure \nWhat we consider as the semiotic structure  of a music piece \nis something that may look like :  \nA B C D E F B C D E G D E D E H \n                                                           \n1 We thus avoid the term semantic , referring to some musical mean- \ning  of objects (for instance, chorus, verse, etc‚Ä¶) : s uch a notion \nfalls completely outside the scope of this paper. \n \n287Poster Session 2\n  \nthus reflecting : \n1)  some sort of high-level decomposition/segmentation of \nthe whole piece into a limited number of blocks (he re 16 \nblocks) of comparable size, and \n2)  some form of similarity or equivalence relationship  be- \ntween blocks bearing identical labels (here, 8 dist inct \nsymbols) \nProviding a semiotic description for a music piece requires \nprimarily the identification of the most adequate granularity  \n(block size and number of blocks) which then condit ions the \ninventory of labels. \nFrom the example below, choosing a finer granularit y could \nlead to a sequence of labels such as: \nAA‚ÄôBB‚ÄôCC‚ÄôDD‚ÄôEE‚ÄôFF‚ÄôBB‚ÄôCC‚ÄôDD‚ÄôEE‚ÄôGG‚ÄôDD‚ÄôEE‚ÄôDD‚ÄôEE‚ÄôHH‚Äô \nwhere any symbol X is systematically followed by symbol X‚Äô, \ntherefore yielding a rather redundant semiotic desc ription. \nConversely, a coarser granularity would require eit her the \nuneven grouping of the units into irregular  segments (i.e. of \nmore diverse sizes)  :  \nA  BC  DE  F  BC  DE  G  DE  DE  H \nor a very misleading representation such as : \nAB  CD  EF  BC  DE  GD  ED  EH \nwhich completely hides the similarities existing be tween por- \ntions of the piece which had identical labels at a lower scale. \nThis example thus illustrates a simple case where t here exist \nclearly a preferable granularity at which the semio tic level of \nthe music piece can be described with some form of optimal \ncompromise  between : \n- The minimality of the set of labels \n- The informativeness of the sequence of labels \n- The regularity of the block size \nThe goal of this work is to present a set of method ological \nprinciples for : \n1)  identifying the most appropriate granularity for de scrib- \ning the semiotic structure, and  \n2)  locating as univocally as possible the correspondin g \nblock boundaries. \nIn this article, the granularity referred to in ite m 1 is defined \nas the structural metric  of the music piece and the actual bor- \nders of the segmental units (item 2) as the realization  of the \nstructural meter.  \nThe proposed process relies on the listening of a m usic piec- \nes, but can be extended to music in written form (s cores). \nHowever, note that scores may not be available and some- \ntimes are even meaningless w.r.t. the type of music al content \nunder consideration. \n3.  BASIC CONCEPTS \n3.1  Definitions \nAs exposed in the previous section, the hypothesis of this work \nis that the semiotic structure of ‚Äúconventional‚Äù mu sic pieces is \nbuilt on structural blocks , characterized by the content of their \nmusical layers. One of the aim of semiotic structur e annotation is therefore to locate the block boundaries  (with the convention \nthat they are synchronized with the first beat of a  bar). We call \nsize  the dimension of the blocks relative to a snap  scale propor- \ntional to that of the beat (see 3.3). \nWe call structural metric pattern , the underlying high-level \norganization of the musical content which is the mo st ade- \nquate for representing economically the semiotic le vel, and \nwe assume that block boundaries rest on the (potent ially ir- \nregular) realization  of that structural metric pattern. The an- \nnotation task thus consists in jointly inferring th e structural \nmetric pattern and its realization. \n3.2  Musical information layers \nEven though this is a simplified view of reality, w e consider \nthat a piece of music is characterized by 4 main reference \nproperties , potentially evolving over time 1 : \n‚Ä¢ intensity (amplitude / sound level) \n‚Ä¢ tonality/modality (reference key and scale) \n‚Ä¢ tempo (speed / pace of the piece) \n‚Ä¢ timbre (instrumentation / audio texture) \nWe also consider that a piece of music shows 4 main levels of \ntemporal organization :  \n‚Ä¢ rhythm (relative duration and accentuation of notes ) \n‚Ä¢ melody (pitch intervals between successive notes) \n‚Ä¢ harmony (chord progression) \n‚Ä¢ lyrics (linguistic content and, in particular, rhym es) \nThese levels of description form 8 musical layers 2.  \nBecause of their cyclic properties in conventional music, the \nlevels of temporal organization are central to the determina- \ntion  of block boundaries, in our approach. Indeed, as e x- \nplained in section 4.1, we assume that block bounda ries coin- \ncide with the convergence of cyclic behaviors takin g place \nsimultaneously in the 4 levels of temporal organiza tion. \nOn the opposite, blocks may globally differ in term s of inten- \nsity, tonality, tempo or timbre but these propertie s may hap- \npen to change within a block without corresponding to a \nstructural boundary.  \n3.3  Block size \nA primary property of blocks is their size, which w e describe \nin a custom unit that we call snap , and which is defined as the \nnumber of times a listener would snap his fingers t o accom- \npany the music, at a rate which is as close as poss ible to 1 bps \n(beat per second). As opposed to the beat (which is  a compo- \nsitional notion), the snap is a perceptual unit. \nAlthough we may come to consider the blocks from a variety \nof perspectives during their identification, their ultimate de- \nscription within the scope of this paper is their s ize in snaps. \nThe definition of the snap requires further consoli dation, \nsince a tempo-invariant unit would be desirable. Ho wever, an \nevolution of the definition of the snap would not a ffect the \nstructural segmentation per se , as the snap is only a measure \nof the block size. \n                                                           \n1 In previous work, we identified 3 reference propert ies only, but we \nconsider now that intensity  should also be part of the list.  \n2 These layers may not all be active simultaneously a nd some addi- \ntional layers may be observed in some music pieces.  \n \n28812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n3.4  Structural metric pattern \nA fundamental assumption of the proposed method is based \non the hypothesis that the semiotic structure can b e described \nin reference to a structural metric pattern , i.e. a prototypical \npartition of the beat or the snap scale. As an exam ple, a very \ncommon structural metric pattern is the repetition of blocks \nof 16 snaps (structural pulsation period Œ® = 16) \nThe high-level structure of the music piece is gove rned by the \nstructural meter but actual semiotic blocks result from the re- \nalization  of the structural meter and this realization may l ead \nto blocks of irregular  size. For example, even if the structural \nperiod of a piece is equal to 16, the size of some blocks may \ndeviate from the prototypical value (for instance, 18). We de- \nvelop further the fact that, in a large number of c ases, irregu- \nlar blocks can be reduced to regular stems that conform to the \nstructural metric pattern.  \nThe structural metric pattern is analogous to the b ar, but op- \nerates at a higher level : whereas the bar is the o rganizational \nentity of low-level elements such as beats and note s, the \nstructural metric pattern governs the organization of mid-\nlevel elements (bars, cells, phases, etc‚Ä¶). \n4.  ANNOTATION CRITERIA AND NOTATION \n4.1  Detection of cycles (syntagmatic analysis) \nIn conventional music, the various temporal organiz ation lay- \ners tend to show (quasi-)cyclic behaviors, which we  define as \nthe recurrent return of the considered layer to som e specific \nstate or set of states 1. For instance, rhythmic patterns general- \nly show a short-term recurrence which participates to the \nmid-level organization of the music piece, melodies  tend to \nreturn to tonic or to exhibit particular intervals (depending on \nthe piece), specific chords sequences conclude harm onic pro- \ngressions (cadences), etc‚Ä¶ \nWe consider that, in conventional music pieces, the re exist \ntime instants for which the 4 levels of temporal or ganization \nexhibit some phase convergence  towards their respective \nends of cycles, which creates identifiable cues  of the piece \nstructure. In other words, block boundaries should corre- \nspond to some form of recurrent convergence of all levels of \ntemporal organization. \nThese instants of convergence take very versatile f orms, as \nthey can be signaled in the music content by very d iverse \ncombination of structuring cues , such as a particular rhyth- \nmic pattern combined with the return to a specific note or \nchord, the completion of a system of rhymes in the lyrics the \nconclusion of a carrure  and a recurrent sound effect‚Ä¶ \nEven though these cues and their combinations are p artly con- \nventional (at least within a particular music genre ), they gener- \nally vary from one piece to another and their ident ification is \npart of the empirical analysis conducted by the ann otator. \nIn our approach, cyclicity plays a central role for  identifying \nstructural blocks through the 2 ensuing properties : \n1)  iterability  : structural blocks can be looped to yield a \nconsistent (larger) musical stream \n2)  suppressibility  : structural blocks can be skipped in the \n                                                           \n1 Note that cyclic  does not necessarily mean periodic, the latter be-\ning a stronger property. For example, the zero-cros sing of a se- \nquence of values form a set of cycles which may not  be periodic.  music piece without creating the perception of a di scon- \ntinuity in the remaining musical stream \nIndeed, if one thinks of a periodic signal, each pe riod can be \nrepeated indefinitely and can be removed from the s ignal \nwithout disrupting seriously the organization of th e remain- \ning signal. This generalizes conceptually to quasi- cyclic pro- \ncesses, as defined above. \nThe property of cyclicity gives a founded ground fo r the syn- \ntagmatic definition of structural blocks. It establ ishes more \nclearly the criterion formerly based on the preserv ation of \n‚Äúmusical consistency‚Äù [12] and also brings addition al sub- \nstance to the concept of Constitutive Solid Loop [1 1]. \nThe listener‚Äôs ability to identify iterable and sup pressible \nsegments in the music piece is a key point in the p roposed \nanalysis and it does not require the annotator to b e able to ex- \npress in musicological terms the actual properties of the \nstructuring cues. \nWhen necessary, the analysis can be complemented by  an \nexplicit designation of the structuring cues, but a ttention must \nbe paid that these cues should not be expected to b e univocal- \nly associated to blocks boundaries : all structurin g cues are \nnot systematically observed at all segment borders and some \ncues can also be observed within block boundaries.  \n4.2  Detection of similarities (paradigmatic analysis) \nThe identification of actual block boundaries is fu rther (or, in \npractice, simultaneously) carried out by performing  paradig- \nmatic analysis on the musical content, for reinforc ing and \ndisambiguating the set of candidate borders hinted by the de- \ntection of cyclic segments. \nIt consists in searching for ‚Äúrepeating‚Äù patterns a cross the \nmusical content, which are identical, similar or, m ore gener- \nally speaking, easy to explain economically  relative to one \nanother (for instance, transposition, change in the  level of in- \nstrumental support, superimposition of a melodic mo tif, in- \nsertion of a musical segment, ‚Ä¶). \nAs for the syntagmatic analysis of section 4.1, the  locations \nof such paradigms do not coincide univocally with b lock \nboundaries : they only constitute additional cues o f such \nboundaries. \nNote that the paradigmatic analysis performed at th is stage \ncalls for similar processes to those that are neede d for label- \ning the segments. However, whereas the labeling sta ge re- \nquires the determination of a global system of cont rasts be- \ntween segments, the extraction of paradigmatic stru ctural \ncues simply requires pairwise  comparisons of musical seg- \nments for the only purpose of identifying and locat ing candi- \ndate blocks. \n4.3  Regularity and reduction \nFor many conventional music pieces, it can be assum ed that a \nmajority of blocks within the piece have a comparab le size in \nsnaps, hence corresponding to some structural pulsa tion peri- \nod (Œ®). Blocks whose size is equal to the structural pul sation \nperiod are called regular  blocks. \nSome blocks have a smaller size than Œ®, which can generally \nbe interpreted as corresponding to a shortened real ization of a \nregular block. This is especially true for half-siz e target seg- \nments, which can often be matched with the first or  second \n289Poster Session 2\n  \nhalf of a regular block observed somewhere else in the piece. \nAlternatively such blocks may be considered as a ha lf reali- \nzation of the structural metric (this is often the case for pre-\nchorus and bridges). \nIn a significant number of cases, blocks are longer  than the \nstructural period. However, in these cases, they ca n often be \nreduced into a stem  of size Œ® and an affix . An affix is a subset \nof snaps which can be viewed as having been inserte d into a \n(regular) stem and affixes are therefore suppressib le from the \noriginal block (but not necessarily iterable), i.e. , the stem \nforms, on its own, an admissible block. If the inse rtion of the \naffix takes place at the beginning (resp. at the en d) of the \nblock, it is called a prefix (resp. suffix).  \nAffixes are particularly easy to identify and locat e within a \nblock when there exist, somewhere else in the song,  another \nblock which corresponds to the realization of the s tem alone.  \nBut sometimes, the stem has to be hypothesized base d on \nmore subtle considerations, because it is not attes ted alone in \nthe piece (but, for instance, with a different affi x). \nFrequent examples of suffixes are observed when for  instance \na block is extended by lengthening the last snap ov er 2 more \nsnaps (resulting in some form of break), by doublin g the dura- \ntion values of the notes on the last 2 snaps of the  block or by \nrepeating the last 4 snaps twice (thus rendering an  insistence \neffect). Affixes within blocks can be more tricky t o detect, and \nmay take versatile forms, for instance the repetiti on of a p-snap \nsegment, a tonal excursion of a few snap or a segme nt with to- \ntally different properties from the rest of the blo ck. \nBy convention, prefixes and suffixes should be of m aximum \nsize equal to half of that of the block (preferably  strictly less) \nand they should not alter the harmonic valence  of the block, \ni.e. the harmonic properties at the block boundarie s \n4.4  Structural metric pattern notation \nTo describe the structural metric pattern, we use t he follow- \ning notation : \nn a constant stem size of n snaps throughout the piec e \n{n 1,n2}  2 stem sizes in the piece, n 1 and n 2, occurring in any \norder but in decreasing frequency (can be generaliz ed \nto more than 2 values)  \n(n 1,n 2)  a systematic alternance of stem sizes n 1 and n 2, starting \nwith n 1 (can be generalized to more than 2 values)  \nThese notations are superscripted with a star (n*, {n 1,n2}*, \netc‚Ä¶), if the piece contains only within-blocks irr egularities, \nor very few short blocks considered by the annotato r as non-\nrepresentative of the dominant structure of the pie ce (in par- \nticular, in intros, outros, re-intros, etc‚Ä¶). If re levant, the an- \nnotator can combine further the notations, for inst ance \n{16,(12,8)}, but these needs are quite exceptional‚Ä¶  \nIn conventional pop music, the most common segmenta l struc- \nture is m x 16 * (m being the number of blocks, which is itself \nusually close to 16), but pieces from the genre blues  have usu- \nally block sizes based on 24 snaps. More complex pa tterns \nsuch as {16,12}, (16,8) or (16,16,8) happen to be o bserved. \n4.5  Block size notation \nFollowing are the corresponding notation convention s which \nwe use to designate the size of (realized) blocks, in reference \nto a structural pulsation period of n snaps: \n [n+p] Insertion of a p-snap suffix after stem  \n[p+n] Insertion of a p-snap prefix before stem  \n[n&p] Insertion of a p-snap infix (somewhere) inside stem \n[p-n] Omission of p snaps at the end of stem \n[-p+n] Omission of p snaps at the beginning of stem \n[n\\p] Omission of p snaps (somewhere) inside stem \n[n/2] Half-size block (undetermined place of missing half)  \n[x] Undeterminable size (usually owing to a lack of snap)  \nSometimes, two structural blocks may overlap over p  snaps, \nwhich we call block tiling . This is the case when the realiza- \ntion of a new block starts while the previous block s is still p \nsnaps before its final boundary and continues in th e mean- \ntime (for instance, in canons). It is also the case  when some \nsnaps function simultaneously as the end of a given block and \nthe beginning of the next one. The notation convent ion for \ntiling situations is : [n-p [p] ‚Äìp+n]. \nNote that the internal structure of blocks could be  further \nspecified by decomposing the block size into sub-bl ocks ac- \ncording to paradigmatic properties within the block  (for in- \nstance 4x4 as the internal structure of a size 16 b lock), but \nthis goes beyond the scope of the current paper. \n5.  GENERAL METHODOLOGY \n5.1  Annotation process \nBased on the notions introduced in the previous sec tion, the \nannotation of a music piece X can be understood as an (em- \npirical) joint estimation task, namely the determin ation of  : \n‚Ä¢ The most likely structural metric pattern (M) for t he piece  \n‚Ä¢ The most likely decomposition of the piece into a s et of \nblocks (S), i.e. the realization of M. \nIn practice, the annotator proceeds iteratively as follows : \n1.  hypothetize  a structural period Œ®, or (more generally) a \nstructural metric pattern M from the listening of X  \n2.  (attempt to) decompose  X into blocks following M, by \nintroducing, if and only if necessary, irregulariti es (af- \nfixes, irregular blocks) so as to satisfy cyclicity  of \nblocks and to maximize similarities across blocks ( resp. \nsections 4.1 and 4.2). \n3.  consider  possible alternatives to Œ® or M \n4.  if such alternative(s)  seem to be worth considering , re- \nturn to step 2 and test the new hypothesis \nThe understanding of step 2 is crucial to the propo sed meth- \nodology : at that stage, the annotator is actually trying to es- \ntimate the realization of M via the minimization of  the neces- \nsary distortion that M should undergo to make it ma tch the \nproperties of the actual musical content of X. \nUltimately, among various hypotheses for M and the corre- \nsponding decompositions, the annotator retains that  which \nseems globally more economical for describing the s emiotic \nlevel, i.e. the solution which results in a satisfa ctory com- \npromise between : \n‚Ä¢ the simplicity and typicality of the structural met ric \n‚Ä¢ the regularity of the decomposition \n‚Ä¢ the non-redundancy of successive blocks \n‚Ä¢ the closeness of the structural period(s) to a refe rence val- \nue (currently set to 15 seconds) \n29012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \nFigure 1 : illustration of the case study of sectio n 6.     5.2  Hypothesizing the structural metric pattern \n5.2.1  A priori properties and typical values \nPrevious work [12] has put forward arguments based on the \n‚ÄúPredictive Information Context‚Äù (PIC) suggesting t hat an a \npriori  economical description of the structure of a music  \npiece is based on segments of typical length equal to the \nsquare root  \u0001\u0002‚àö\u0004  of \nthe length of the piece. In \nthe annex section, we pro- \npose complementary con- \nsiderations based on in- \nformation theory concepts, \nwhich strengthen this \npoint. \nWe assume that structural \nblocks of approximate size \n‚àö\u0004  happen to be a rea- \nsonable initial assumption  \nwhen estimating the struc- \ntural pulsation period. \nHowever, the actual analy- \nsis of the musical content \nmay lead to a final ( a pos- \nteriori ) result which devi- \nates significantly from this \ninitial guess. \nOn the basis of an average song length of 240 secon ds, ‚àö\u0004 \nfalls in the range of 15.5 s. With a snap around 1 s, the size of \na block will therefore typically be of 16 snaps. He re again, \nthis property should only be considered an a priori  hypothe- \nsis (the one to start with). \nFrom these consideration, a canonical model  which summa- \nrizes all the a prioris  can be laid down : it consists in 16 \nblocks of 16 snaps of 1s each. For a given piece, t he structur- \nal metric pattern and its realization are thus sear ched as the \nminimal deviation from this canonical model , which enables \na structural description compatible with the musica l content. \n5.2.2  Estimating plausible snap and structural period(s) \nBy definition, the snap is the multiple of the beat  correspond- \ning to a duration as close as possible (in logarith mic scale) to \n1 s (in fact, it usually corresponds to the downbea t, but not \nalways). Identifying the snap is, in general, rathe r straight- \nforward from the listening of parts of the piece, p referably \naway from the beginning or the end, which may exhib it par- \nticular beat and tempo properties. Depending on the  type of \nbar, admissible intervals for the snap are  : [0.71 , 1.41] for \nbinary bars and [0.58, 1.73] for ternary ones (for more com- \nplex, odd bars, the snap can be unevenly alternatin g between \ndifferent numbers of beats). \nOnce the snap is determined, plausible values of th e structur- \nal pulsation period(s) are hypothesized by listenin g to the \npiece and considering in priority its most salient and steady \nparts : typically the chorus (if any), the developm ents of re- \ncurring motifs or phrases, the parts of the piece p erceived as \nhomogeneous, etc‚Ä¶ From these segments, the annotato r can \ngenerally infer rapidly one or two plausible values  of pulsa- \ntion period(s), from which he/she will start a more  compre- \nhensive analysis of the piece, looking for particul ar patterns \nand locating irregularities. Given the central role played by the canonical mode l, the \nvalue of 16 is usually investigated in priority, un less obvious \nevidence in the musical content direct the annotato r towards \nanother hypothesis (for instance, 24 in many pieces  of blues). \n6.  A CASE STUDY \nFigure 1 illustrates the analysis of song Genre 08 from the \nRWC database [17] (labeled as Rock ). Structural blocks are \ndepicted both as \ntheir span on the \nx-axis (time in \nsnap) and their \nheight on the y-\naxis (in log \nscale). Each \nblock is identi- \nfied by a distinct \nroman number. \nThe duration of \nthe song is 3‚Äô26‚Äù \n(including initial \nand final silenc- \nes) and the size \nof the song in \nsnaps is 200 \n(snap is almost \nequal to 1 s).  \nSegments IV, VII, XII and XIII present a clear para digmatic \nrelationship (chorus of this piece). Three of them last 18 \nsnaps but XII lasts only 16 snaps and can be consid ered as \nthe stem on which the three other blocks are built by length- \nening the harmonic content over the last 2 snaps. \nSegments II, V, X form a second paradigm, with the return to \ntonic as a clear (conventional) structuring cue. Be ing of size \n16, they are in line with the Œ®=16 hypothesis. An alternative \nhypothesis would be to consider them as the repetit ion of 2 al- \nmost identical (half-)blocks of 8 snaps, but i) thi s would need \nthe introduction of a second structural period, ii)  no occurrence \nof such a half-block alone  is observed in the song and iii) it \nwould split the rhyme pattern of block V.  \nSegments III, VI and XI constitute a third paradigm . Their raw \nform amounts for 14 snaps, but they can be describe d as a 4x4 \nsnap carrure  of the abab  type, whose last quarter has been trun- \ncated of the last 2 snaps, hence the notation 16-2,  This comforts \n(or at least does not contradict) the hypothesis Œ®=16. \nSegments I and IX are very similar, I being an inst rumental \nintro of 16 snaps and IX the second half of I, used  as an in- \nstrumental bridge (hence the notation -8+16). Final ly, VIII is \na solo, which conveniently lasts exactly 16 snaps. \nThe segmental structure of the piece is therefore c onsidered to \nbe 13 x 16 *, i.e. a basic 16-snap pattern realized 13 times wi th \na few within-block irregularities. Alternative opti ons could \nhave been 25 x 8*, but this would introduce much redundancy \nin the underlying semiotic description, since almos t all seg- \nments would be observed in systematical pairs, with out bring- \ning significantly down the number of irregular segm ents (only \nIX would thus become regular). A pattern such as (1 6,14,18) * \ncould be envisaged given the recurrence of this par ticular size \nsequence in II-III-IV and V-VI-VII but the existenc e of XII as \na 16-snap realization of the chorus just in between  XI and XIII \nmakes this complicated alternative a non-sustainabl e option. \n291Poster Session 2\n  \n7.

Firstly, we propose a purely content-based ap-\nproach, working on low-level (timbral, temporal, and tonal)\nand inferred high-level semantic descriptions of music. Sec-\nondly, we consider its simple reÔ¨Ånement by adding a mini-\nmum amount of genre metadata. We compare the proposed\napproaches with one content-based and three metadata-based\nbaselines. As such, we consider content-based approach\nworking on inferred semantic descriptors, a tag-based rec-\nommender exploiting artist tags, a commercial black-box\nrecommender partially employing collaborative Ô¨Åltering in-\nformation, and a simple genre-based random recommender.\nWe conduct a listening experiment with 19 participants. The\nobtained results reveal that although the low-level/semantic\ncontent-based approach does not achieve the performance\nof the baseline working exclusively on the inferred seman-\ntic descriptors, the proposed reÔ¨Ånement provides signiÔ¨Åcant\nimprovement in the listeners‚Äô satisfaction comparable with\nmetadata-based approaches, and surpasses these approaches\nby the number of novel relevant recommendations. We con-\nclude that the proposed content-based approach reÔ¨Åned by\nsimple genre metadata is suited for music discovery not only\nin the long-tail but also within popular music items.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMusic recommendation is a challenging topic in the Music\nInformation Research community. A rapid growth of digital\nmusic industry has led to vast amounts of music available\nfor easy and fast access. Nevertheless, Ô¨Ånding relevant and\nnovel music is a difÔ¨Åcult task for listeners, especially in the\nsituation when new music appears every day. To fulÔ¨Åll their\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.needs, researchers and practitioners strive for better recom-\nmendation systems, which are able to facilitate music search\nand retrieval based on aggregated user proÔ¨Åles, or simple\nqueries-by-example speciÔ¨Åed by users. To this end, im-\nprovements of suitable underlying user models and/or music\nsimilarity measures are necessary. Currently, the state-of-\nthe-art approaches to music recommendation exploit both\nmetadata information about music items (metadata-based\napproaches) and the information extracted from the audio\nsignal itself (content-based approaches). Moreover, there\nexist hybrid approaches utilizing both types of information.\nPossible metadata includes editorial information, social\ntags, and user listening/consumption behavior in form of\nlistening statistics, such as playcounts and artist charts, sell\nhistories, and user ratings. This information is found to be\neffective to provide satisfactory recommendations for users\nwhen dealing with popular music and operating on large\ncollaborative Ô¨Åltering datasets. Nevertheless, the disadvan-\ntages of using metadata lie in the long-tail and cold-start\nproblems [6]. A system may not have sufÔ¨Åcient and correct\nmetadata, including social tags, user ratings, or even edito-\nrial information, for unpopular items. This can signiÔ¨Åcantly\nlimit the quality of recommendations or even make them im-\npossible. Moreover, gathering such metadata requires time\nand a large user base, which complicates the workability of\nthe system on initial stages even for popular items.\nIn contrast, content-based information, extracted from\nthe audio itself, can be valuable to overcome these prob-\nlems as it can be used independently of the popularity of\nmusic items or availability of a user base. A number of re-\nsearch works exist on both content-based music similarity\nmeasures, or distances,1suitable for music recommenda-\ntion, and approaches to user modeling. Objective content-\nbased distances generally employ sets of low-level timbral,\ntemporal, and tonal descriptors and/or high-level descriptors\ninferred from the low-level ones [2, 4, 5, 16, 17, 20]. Dif-\nferent works evidence usefulness of high-level semantic de-\nscriptions employed in place of, or in addition to, low-level\nmusic descriptions in the task of assessing music similar-\nity [2, 4, 5]. There are also evidences that content-based\n1We will refer to any music similarity measure with a term ‚Äúdistance‚Äù.\n97Poster Session 1\napproaches can be close, or even comparable, to success-\nful metadata-based approaches in terms of the relevance of\nrecommendations [1, 3, 15], especially in the long tail. In\naddition to objective distances, their personalization accord-\ning to a concrete user is considered in some works. Al-\nternatively, there exist research on user models for music\nrecommendation which employ classiÔ¨Åcation into interest\ncategories using content-based information [8,10] or hybrid\nsources [19], apply distances starting from a set of preferred\nitems in a content-based vector space [3, 13], or propose\nmore complex hybrid probabilistic approaches [12, 21].\nOne of the problems of existing research on music rec-\nommendation lies in a difÔ¨Åculty to conduct comprehensive\nsubjective evaluations with real listeners. Up to our knowl-\nedge, few existing research works involve evaluations with\nreal participants, and they are signiÔ¨Åcantly limited by the\nnumber of participants [3,10] or by the number of evaluated\ntracks per approach [1, 14], being in a trade-off situation.\nIn the present work, we consider music recommendation\napproaches which are based on sets of music tracks explic-\nitly given by users as an evidence of their musical prefer-\nences (the henceforth called ‚Äúpreference sets‚Äù ). We focus\non content-based and hybrid approaches, striving for both\nrelevance and novelty of recommendations. It is important\nto highlight the novelty aspect, as the existing metadata-\nbased approaches working on collaborative Ô¨Åltering princi-\nples are known to have a drawback to produce recommen-\ndations already familiar to listeners [6]. We follow the re-\nsearch presented in [3,9] in another peculiarity of this work,\nnamely, using explicitly given preference examples. Such\nan explicit strategy was shown to capture the essence of\nusers‚Äô musical preferences being suitable for preference vi-\nsualization and distance-based music recommendation. Al-\nthough requiring additional user effort to provide a list of\npreferred tracks, this strategy does not require any ‚Äúadapta-\ntion‚Äù period, which is common to the cold-start prone sys-\ntems gathering implicit user information. Starting from this\nstrategy, we strive to improve distance-based approaches to\nmusic recommendation, working on content, evaluate them\nin comparison to metadata-based approaches on real listen-\ners, and understand to what extent metadata is necessary to\nmake a satisfactory music recommender.\nWe propose two distance-based approaches to music rec-\nommendation working on content-based and hybrid infor-\nmation (Section 2.1). Firstly, we consider a complex dis-\ntance combining a set of low-level (timbral, temporal, and\ntonal) and inferred high-level semantic descriptors. This\ndistance has been successfully evaluated in the task of ob-\njective music similarity [4], but it requires additional atten-\ntion in the context of music recommendation. Secondly,\nwe consider how a minimum amount of metadata can im-\nprove purely content-based recommendations, and propose\na Ô¨Åltering approach relying on single, but sufÔ¨Åciently de-scriptive, genre tags to reÔ¨Åne recommendations. We eval-\nuate these approaches against four baselines (Section 2.2).\nAs such, we consider a content-based distance working on\nsemantic descriptors, being a component of the proposed\ncomplex distance, and three approaches working purely on\nmetadata. We employ a semantic tag-based approach, which\noperates on artist tags obtained from the Last.fm2service,\nand a state-of-the-art commercial recommender on the ex-\nample of iTunes Genius ,3which relies on a collaborative\n‚Äúwisdom of crowds‚Äù. We also consider genre-based recom-\nmendations as the simplest metadata-based baseline. Char-\nacterization of subjects is presented in Section 3.1, while\nSection 3.2 explains the listening experiment instructions,\nstimuli and procedure. Section 3.3 presents and discusses\nthe evaluation results, and we conclude with general obser-\nvations and lessons learned from this study in Section 4.\n2. STUDIED APPROACHES\nTo provide recommendations from our music collection (the\nhenceforth called music collection ), the approaches we con-\nsider here apply distance measures from a set of tracks, given\nby the user as evidence of his/her musical preferences (a\npreference set ) to the tracks in the collection. In order to\ncreate such a preference set, the user is asked to gather a\nminimal set of music tracks, which he/she believes to be\nsufÔ¨Åcient to grasp or convey his/her musical preferences,\nand submit them in audio format (e.g. mp3) or by edito-\nrial metadata sufÔ¨Åcient to reliably identify and retrieve each\ntrack. The amount of required tracks is not speciÔ¨Åed being\nleft to a decision of the user. We retrieve or clean the edito-\nrial metadata for all provided tracks by means of audio Ô¨Ån-\ngerprinting4to be able to use metadata-based approaches.\nAs the source for recommendations, we employed a large\nin-house music collection, covering a wide range of gen-\nres, styles, and arrangements. This collection contains 68K\nmusic excerpts (30 sec.) by 16K artists with a maximum\nof 5 tracks per artist. For consistency, in our experiments\nwe assume each of the recommendation approaches to out-\nput 15 tracks by different artists (1 track per artist) not be-\ning present among the artists in the user‚Äôs preferences set.\nTherefore, each approach applies an artist Ô¨Ålter.\n2.1 Proposed Approaches\n2.1.1 Semantic/Low-level Content-based Distance\n(C-SEMLL)\nAs our Ô¨Årst proposed approach, we follow the ideas pre-\nsented in [4] and employ a complex content-based distance,\n2http://last.fm , all tags were obtained on March, 2011.\n3http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/ , all experi-\nments were conducted using iTunes 10.1.1.4 on March, 2011.\n4We used MusicBrainz service: http://musicbrainz.org/\ndoc/MusicBrainz_Picard .\n9812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwhich is a weighted combination of three components:\n‚Ä¢A Euclidean distance on a set of timbral, temporal, and\ntonal descriptors with a preliminary principle compo-\nnent analysis.\n‚Ä¢A timbral distance based on the Kullback-Leibler diver-\ngence between single Gaussian models of MFCCs.\n‚Ä¢A simple tempo distance, based on matches of BPM and\nonset rate values.\n‚Ä¢A semantic distance, working on a set of high-level se-\nmantic descriptors (genres, musical culture, moods, in-\nstrumentation, rhythm, and tempo) inferred by support\nvector machines (SVMs) from low-level timbral, tem-\nporal, and tonal features.\nThe latter semantic distance has been previously evaluated\nin the similar context of music recommendation based on\npreference sets [3], and was shown to surpass common low-\nlevel timbral approaches. The interested reader is referred to\nthe aforecited literature for further details about the descrip-\ntors used, the component distances, and their weighting.\nWe retrieve recommendations using this distance by the\nfollowing procedure. For each track Xin the user‚Äôs pref-\nerence set (a recommendation source), we apply the dis-\ntance to retrieve the closest track CX(a recommendation\noutcome candidate) from the music collection and form a\ntriplet (X,CX,distance (X,CX)). We sort the triplets by\nthe obtained distances, delete the duplicates of the recom-\nmendation sources (i.e. each track from the preference set\nproduces only one recommendation outcome), and apply an\nartist Ô¨Ålter. We return the recommendation outcome candi-\ndates from the top 15 triplets as recommendations. If it is\nimpossible to produce 15 recommendations due to the small\nsize of the preference set (less than 15 tracks) or the applied\nartist Ô¨Ålter, we increase the amount of possible recommen-\ndation outcome candidates per recommendation source.\n2.1.2 Semantic/Low-level Content-based Distance ReÔ¨Åned\nBy Genre Metadata (C-SEMLL+M-GENRE)\nWe consider the inclusion of metadata in purpose to reÔ¨Åne\nthe recommendations provided by content-based methods\non the example of C-SEMLL. We strive to include the mini-\nmum amount of metadata, preferably being low-cost to gather\nand maintain, but however sufÔ¨Åciently descriptive for effec-\ntive Ô¨Åltering. The experiments conducted in [3] point us\nto the fact, that simple genre/style tags can be a reasonable\nsource of information to provide recommendations superior\nto the common low-level timbral music similarity based on\nMFCCs. Therefore, we propose a simple Ô¨Åltering to expand\nthe C-SEMLL approach. We apply the same sorting proce-\ndure, but we solely consider the tracks of the same genre\nlabels as possible recommendation outcomes. Moreover,\nwe suppose that increasing the speciÔ¨Åcity of genre tags to\ncertain amount (e.g. from ‚Äúrock‚Äù to ‚Äúprog rock‚Äù) would in-crease the quality of Ô¨Åltering.\nTo this end, we annotate the music collection and the\nuser‚Äôs preference set with genre tags. Such information can\nbe obtained for the music collections by manual expert an-\nnotations, from social tagging services, or can be already\navailable in the ID3 tags for audio Ô¨Åles or in other meta-\ndata description formats generated on the music production\nstage. As a proof-of-concept, we opt for obtaining artist tags\nwith the Last.fm API to simulate manual single-genre anno-\ntations of each track. Last.fm provides tag information for\nboth artists and tracks. We opt for artist tags due to the fact\nthat track tags tend to be more sparse, generally more difÔ¨Å-\ncult to obtain, and can be insufÔ¨Åcient for the music retrieval\nin the long tail, and assign to the tracks the same tags that\nwere assigned to the artists.\nWe analyze a set of possible tags suitable for the music\ncollection. For each track, we select the Last.fm artist tags\nwith the maximum weight (100.0) and add them to the pool\nof possible tags for genre annotation (‚Äútop-tags‚Äù). We then\nÔ¨Ålter the pool deleting the tags with less than 100 occur-\nrences (this threshold was selected in accordance with the\ntop-tag histogram and the collection size) and blacklisting\nthe tags which do not correspond to genres (‚Äú60s‚Äù, ‚Äú80s‚Äù,\n‚Äúunder 2000 listeners‚Äù, ‚Äújapanese‚Äù, ‚Äúspanish‚Äù, etc.) We then\nrevise the music collection to annotate each track with a\nsingle top-tag. For each track, we consider the candidates\namong its artist tags, selecting the tags with the maximum\npossible weight, which are also present in the top-tag pool.\nIf there are several candidates (e.g. both ‚Äúrock‚Äù and ‚Äúprog\nrock‚Äù have weight 100.0 and are present in the top-tag pool),\nwe select the top-tag, which is the least frequent in the pool.\nThereafter, we annotate the tracks from the user‚Äôs preference\nset in the same manner using the created pool. The idea be-\nhind this procedure is to select the most salient tags (top-\ntags) for the music collection, skip possible tag outliers, and\nannotate each track with the most speciÔ¨Åc of these top-tags\nkeeping the maximum possible conÔ¨Ådence level.\n2.2 Baseline Approaches\n2.2.1 Semantic Content-based Distance (C-SEM)\nAs our Ô¨Årst baseline, we employ a content-based distance,\nworking on a set of inferred high-level semantic descriptors,\nwhich was used as a component of the complex distance in\nthe C-SEMLL approach (see Section 2.1.1). Using this dis-\ntance, we retrieve recommendations with the same sorting\nprocedure as followed for the C-SEMLL approach.\n2.2.2 Artist Similarity based on Last.fm Tags (M-TAGS)\nAlternatively, we consider a metadata-based distance work-\ning on the artist level. We gather social tags provided by\ntheLast.fm API for the artists from the preference set and\nthe music collection. For each artist, the API provides a\n99Poster Session 1\nweight-normalized tag list with weights in the [0,100.0]in-\nterval. We select a minimum weight threshold of 10.0to\nÔ¨Ålter possibly inaccurate tags. We assign the resulting tags\nto each track in the preference set and the music collection.\nWe then apply the latent semantic analysis [11,18] to reduce\nthe dimensionality to 300 latent dimensions. We apply the\nPearson correlation distance [6] on the resulting topic space,\nand retrieve recommendations with the same procedure as\nfollowed for the C-SEMLL.\n2.2.3 Black-box Similarity by iTunes Genius (M-GENIUS)\nWe consider commercial black-box recommendations ob-\ntained from the iTunes Genius playlist generation algorithm.\nGiven a music collection and a query, this algorithm is capa-\nble to generate a playlist by means of the underlying music\nsimilarity measure, which works on metadata and partially\nemploys collaborative Ô¨Åltering of large amounts of user data\n(music sales, listening history, and track ratings) [1]. From\nthe preference set we randomly select 15 tracks annotated\nby artist, album, and track title information, sufÔ¨Åcient to be\nrecognized by Genius . For each of the selected tracks (a\nrecommendation source), we generate a playlist, apply the\nartist Ô¨Ålter, and select the top track as the recommendation\noutcome. We increase the amount of possible outcomes per\nsource when it is impossible to produce 15 recommenda-\ntions.\n2.2.4 Random Tracks From the same Genre (M-GENRE)\nFinally, as the simplest and low-cost metadata-based base-\nline, we consider random recommendations relying on genre\ncategories of the user‚Äôs preference set. We annotate the mu-\nsic collection and the user‚Äôs preference set with genre labels\nby the same procedure as in the C-SEMLL+M-GENRE ap-\nproach (see Section 2.1.2). We randomly preselect 15 tracks\nfrom the preference set and for each of the tracks we re-\nturn a random track of the same genre label from the music\ncollection. Again, we increase the amount of possible rec-\nommendation outcomes per recommendation source when\nit is impossible to produce 15 recommendations.\n3. EVALUATION\n3.1 Subjects\nA total of 19 voluntary subjects (selected from the authors‚Äô\ncolleagues, their acquaintances and families) were asked to\nprovide their respective preference sets and additional in-\nformation, including personal data (gender, age, interest for\nmusic, musical background), and a description of the strat-\negy and criteria followed to select the music pieces. The\nparticipants were not informed about any further usage of\nthe gathered data, such as giving music recommendations.\nThe participants‚Äô age varied between 26 and 46 ( ¬µ= 33.72,\nœÉ= 4.65). All participants showed a very high interest inmusic (rating with ¬µ= 9.24andœÉ= 1.01, where 0 means\nno interest and 10 means passionate). In addition, 17 par-\nticipants play at least one musical instrument. The number\nof tracks selected by the participants to convey their mu-\nsical preferences was very varied, ranging from 10 to 178\nmusic pieces ( ¬µ= 67.26,œÉ= 42.53) with the median\nbeing 61 tracks. The time spent for this task also differed\na lot, ranging from half an hour to 60 hours ( ¬µ= 6.22,\nœÉ= 15.06) with the median being 2 hours. The strategy\nfollowed by the participants to gather preference sets var-\nied as well. Driving criteria for the selection of tracks in-\ncluded musical genre, mood, uses of music (listening, danc-\ning, singing, playing), expressivity, musical qualities, and\nchronological order. Taking into account this information,\nwe expect our population to represent music enthusiasts.\n3.2 Evaluation Methodology\nWe performed subjective listening tests on the 19 partici-\npants using our in-house music collection (see Section 2).\nOne recommendation playlist per each of the 6 considered\napproaches was generated for each participant. Each playlist\nconsisted of 15 tracks returned by the respected approach\nspeciÔ¨Åcs. Due to the applied artist Ô¨Ålter, the playlists nei-\nther contained more than one track of the same artist nor\ncontained artists present in the preference set. We merged,\nrandomized, and anonymized all playlists. This allowed\nto avoid any response bias due to presentation order, rec-\nommendation approach, or contextual recognition of tracks\n(e.g. by artist names) by participants. Moreover, the par-\nticipants were not aware of the amount of recommendation\napproaches, their names and their rationales.\nA questionnaire was given for the subjects to express dif-\nferent subjective impressions related to the recommended\nmusic. A ‚Äú familiarity ‚Äù rating ranged from the identiÔ¨Åcation\nof artist and title (4) to absolute unfamiliarity (0), with inter-\nmediate steps for knowing the title (3), the artist (2), or just\nfeeling familiar with the music (1). A ‚Äú liking ‚Äù rating mea-\nsured the enjoyment of the presented music with 0 and 1\ncovering negative liking, 2 being a kind of neutral position,\nand 3 and 4 representing increasing liking for the musical\nexcerpt. A rating of ‚Äú listening intentions ‚Äù measured pref-\nerence, but in a more direct and behavioral way than the\n‚Äúliking ‚Äù scale, as an intention is closer to action than just\nthe abstraction of liking. Again this scale contained 2 posi-\ntive and 2 negative steps plus a neutral one. Finally, an even\nmore direct rating was included with the name ‚Äú give-me-\nmore ‚Äù allowing just 1 or 0 to respectively indicate a request\nfor, or a reject of, more music like the one presented. The\nusers were also asked to provide title and artist for those\ntracks rated high in the familiarity scale. The textual mean-\ning of the ratings was presented to the participants together\nwith the rating values.\n10012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3.3 Evaluation Results\nFirst, we manually corrected the familiarity rating when the\nartist/title, provided by the user, was wrong (hence a famil-\niarity rating of ‚Äú3‚Äù or, more frequently, ‚Äú4‚Äù, was sometimes\nlowered to 1). These corrections represented less than 3%\nof the total familiarity judgments.\nConsidering the subjective ratings used and our focus on\nmusic discovery, i.e. relevant and novel recommendations,\nwe expect a good recommender system to provide high lik-\ning, listening intentions, and ‚Äúgive-me-more‚Äù ratings for a\nmajority of the retrieved tracks and, most importantly, for\nlow-familiarity tracks. We recoded user ratings for each\nevaluated track into 3 main categories - hits,fails, and trusts\n- referring to the type of the recommendation. In the case of\nliking, hits were the tracks which received low-familiarity\nrating (<2) and a high ( >2) liking rating. Fails were the\ntracks having a low ( <3) liking rating. Trusts were the\ntracks which got a high familiarity ( >1) and a high ( >2)\nliking rating. We similarly recoded the intentions and ‚Äúgive-\nme-more‚Äù ratings, and obtained three different recommen-\ndation outcome categories per recommended track. We then\ncombined the into a Ô¨Ånal category requiring the coincidence\nof all three outcome categories in order to consider it to be\na hit, a fail, or a trust. Otherwise, the recommendation was\nconsidered as ‚Äúunclear‚Äù (e.g. when a track is a hit using the\nliking, but it is a fail by other two indexes), which, in total,\namounted to 20.4% of all recommendations. We excluded\nthese recommendations from further analysis.\nTable 1 reports the percent of each outcome category\nper recommendation approach. As we can see, the pro-\nposed C-SEMLL+M-GENRE approach yielded the largest\namount of hits (32.0%), followed by M-TAGS (29.7%) and\nM-GENIUS (28.2%). The C-SEMLL+M-GENRE was the\nonly (partially) content-based approach that provided con-\nsiderably large amount of successful recommendations. We\ncan evidence that inclusion of genre metadata improved the\namount of hits by 11% for the C-SEMLL, making its re-\nÔ¨Åned version comparable to the metadata-based baselines.\nOn the other side, the M-GENIUS and M-TAGS approaches\nprovided the largest amount of trusts (18.3% and 10.6% re-\nspectively), while the rest of approaches yielded only scarce\ntrusts (5.3% for C-SEMLL+M-GENRE, the rest below 3%).\nTrusts, provided their overall amount is low, can be use-\nful for a user to feel that the recommender is understanding\nhis/her preferences [1,7]. Nevertheless, their amount should\nnot be excessive, especially in the use-case of music discov-\nery. Finally, we can see that all recommendation approaches\nprovided more than 33% of fails, which means that at least\neach third recommendation was possibly annoying for the\nuser. In order to test if the approach and the outcome are\nassociated (i.e. if certain approaches provide hit, fails or\ntrust percents that are statistically different than those pro-\nvided by other methods) we performed a chi-square test thatApproach fail hit trust unclear\nC-SEMLL+M-GENRE 41.9 32.0 5.3 20.8\nM-TAGS 38.9 29.7 10.6 20.8\nM-GENIUS 33.1 28.2 18.3 20.4\nM-GENRE 51.2 26.0 2.8 20.0\nC-SEM 53.3 23.9 2.8 20.0\nC-SEMLL 58.1 21.1 0.4 20.4\nTable 1 .

The effect was conÔ¨Årmed in all of them\n(F(5,1705) = 15 .237,p < 0.001 for the liking rating,\nF(5,1705) = 14 .578,p < 0.001 for the intentions rat-\ning, andF(5,1705) = 11 .420,p < 0.001for the ‚Äúgive-\nme-more‚Äù rating). Pairwise comparisons using Tukey‚Äôs test\nrevealed the same pattern of differences between the ap-\nproaches, irrespective of the 3 tested indexes. It highlights\nthe following groups with no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differ-\nence inside each group: 1) M-GENIUS, M-TAGS, and C-\nSEMLL+M-GENRE having the highest ratings, 2) C-SEM\nand C-SEMLL+M-GENRE, and 3) C-SEM, M-GENRE, and\nC-SEMLL having the lowest. Note, that these groups are\npartially intersected with the C-SEMLL+M-GENRE and C-\nSEM both belonging to two different groups. The mean lik-\ning and listening intentions ratings are presented in Figure 1.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have considered different distance-based approaches to\nmusic recommendation, working on content information and\nmetadata to generate recommendations from a set of music\n101Poster Session 1\ntracks explicitly provided by a user as an evidence of her/his\nmusical preferences. We proposed a complex content-based\nlow-level/semantic approach and its simple reÔ¨Ånement us-\ning genre labels as a minimum amount of metadata. We\nhypothesized that such single-genre information is consid-\nerably low-cost to gather and maintain meanwhile it is suf-\nÔ¨Åciently descriptive for effective Ô¨Åltering.\nThe proposed approaches were evaluated against the four\nbaselines on a population of 19 music enthusiasts. Con-\nsidering purely content-based approaches, we did not Ô¨Ånd\nany improvements over the baseline semantic recommender\nusing a complex low-level/semantic distance instead. This\nsuggests that such a complex distance, previously found to\novercome the semantic distance in the task of music simi-\nlarity, is not well suited for the music recommendation use-\ncase. Further study to reveal its nature will be necessary.\nNevertheless, the reÔ¨Åning of the proposed complex distance\nby simple genre labels showed a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement.\nFurthermore, such a reÔ¨Åned approach surpasses the consid-\nered metadata-based recommenders in terms of successful\nnovel recommendations (hits) and provides satisfying rec-\nommendations, comparable to these baselines with no sta-\ntistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference.\nThe conducted evaluation corroborates a similar study\npresented in [3], in which similar patterns of no statisti-\ncally signiÔ¨Åcant difference between a content-based seman-\ntic distance and a simple genre-based baseline were found.\nThe gap between both of them and commercial metadata-\nbased recommendations, partially exploiting collaborative\nÔ¨Åltering data, was also shown there. We extend this results\nnow with the proposed reÔ¨Åning approach making possible to\novercome such a gap. We may conclude that the proposed\napproach, operating on complex content-based distance, re-\nÔ¨Åned by simple genre metadata is well suited for the use-\ncase of music discovery not only for the long-tail but also\nfor popular items.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThough signiÔ¨Åcant attention has been devoted to segmenta-\ntion and labeling algorithms for discovering chords [14, 16,\n19] and keys [4,16,18] in music scores, little work has been\ndone on automating higher-level music analysis. One reason\nfor the small body of research on this topic is that such anal-\nysis is highly subjective and relies heavily on musical intu-\nition. Another reason is that there are numerous methods of\nanalysis, which are often best suited to a particular corpus\nof music. We take a step toward bridging this gap between\nlabeling and higher-level analysis by tackling the problem\nof Ô¨Ånding neo-Riemannian cycles in chord sequences using\na Ô¨Ånite-state approach.\nNeo-Riemannian music theory [17] posits that harmonies\nare related by means of transformations, rather than a com-\nmon tonic. The theory deÔ¨Ånes three primary transformations\nP,L, andRthat operate over the set of 24 major and minor\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.triads (assuming enharmonic equivalence). Each transfor-\nmation involves two triads that share two common tones.\nPtransforms a triad to its parallel major or minor triad, L\ntransforms a major triad to a minor triad whose root is four\nsemitones higher (and vice-versa), and Rtransforms a triad\nto its relative major or minor triad. A cycle is generated by\nobtaining a triad, and repeatedly applying an identical per-\nmutation of either LP,RP,LRP , orLRat least until the\noriginating triad is reached again. These cycles partition the\nharmonic space and give structure to certain musical works.\nWhen neo-Riemannian theorists analyze a musical work,\nthey locate a passage and identify harmonies that ‚Äúpartici-\npate‚Äù in a cycle. There are several motivations for automat-\ning this process. The Ô¨Årst is to attempt to formalize the task,\nand in the process arrive at a more rigorous deÔ¨Ånition and\nunderstanding of what constitutes a cycle‚Äîand by exten-\nsion what musical judgements are made during an analysis.\nThe second is to facilitate a more comprehensive study of\nthese cycles than currently exists [3]. Computer-aided anal-\nysis could provide a critique of the theory itself, as well as\nshed light on other music theoretic issues.\nThe existence of insertions and deletions presents chal-\nlenges to accurately Ô¨Ånding neo-Riemannian cycles. Sup-\nposeTnis the composition of ntransformations along a cy-\ncle. In theory, a cycle consists of a sequence of triads, such\nthat each successive triad is generated by a single T1trans-\nformation. In practice, inserted harmonies intermix with the\ntriads that participate in the theoretical cycle; and, triads\nin the theoretical cycle can be missing from the observable\ncycle due to the use of compound operations ( Tn, where\nn>1), or because the cycle is incomplete. On the surface,\nthis problem may appear best solved by string matching\nalgorithms. Approximate string matching algorithms [12]\ncan handle insertions and deletions, and some methods have\nbeen developed to search for multiple strings [2]. The main\nproblem with this approach is the representation of the search\nstrings.LPcycles, for instance, consist of all strings begin-\nning withLPLPLP orPLPLPL and continuing in like\nfashion, of which there are many. LPcycles alone partition\nthe set of triads into four distinct cycles, each of which has\nsix distinct originating triads and two directions of motion.\n399Poster Session 3\nIn contrast, a Ô¨Ånite-state model facilitates the concise en-\ncoding of a cycle using transformations. It also enables us to\nrepresent transformational music theory in a visual and in-\ntuitive way. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we propose a noisy channel model\nto represent the task of Ô¨Ånding an intended message (a cy-\ncle) given an observation sequence (of chords). Our imple-\nmentation of the model uses weighted Ô¨Ånite-state transduc-\ners (WFSTs). [15] describes this method, as applied to the\nrealm of speech recognition.\nFinite-state transducers (FSTs) are used extensively in\nlanguage and speech processing [9], with potential applica-\ntions to music. WFSTs, which are used to represent proba-\nbilistic Ô¨Ånite-state machines in speech processing [11], could\nbe used similarly in audio music processing. [10] uses WF-\nSTs in the task of audio music identiÔ¨Åcation as both an acous-\ntic model and a compact language model. Drawing on ef-\nforts in language processing that implement the noisy chan-\nnel model with WFSTs [13], our model is a novel applica-\ntion of this technique to symbolic music analysis.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In\nSection 2, we formalize the problem statement and present\nthe noisy channel model. In Section 3, we describe the input\ndata, as well as the training and evaluation methods for our\nmodel. Finally, in Section 4 and Section 5, we present the\nresults of our experiment and discuss our conclusions.\n2. THE MODEL\nOur goal is to design a system that will accurately iden-\ntify and label all strings of harmonies corresponding to neo-\nRiemannian cycles in a music score. The input to the system\nis a string of triad labels representing a harmonic analysis,\nand the desired output is a version of that analysis with all\nmusically salient cycles demarcated and labeled.\n2.1 Problem Statement\nLetŒ£1be the alphabet consisting of symbols representing\nthe 24 enharmonically distinct major and minor triads, and\nletŒ£2={P,L,R}, the alphabet of basic neo-Riemannian\ntransformations. Also let Œ£3={[,]}, an alphabet of special\ndemarcation symbols outside of Œ£1andŒ£2. Now, suppose\nwis a string of symbols in Œ£1, corresponding to a harmonic\nanalysis of a music score. The task is to identify exactly\nthe substrings of wthat correspond to neo-Riemannian cy-\ncles. These cycles should be labeled with the corresponding\ntransformations from Œ£2and bounded by symbols from Œ£3.\n2.2 Noisy Channel Model\nWe implement the proposed noisy channel model with a\ncascade of WFSTs. Each component of the noisy channel\nmodel‚Äîa theory model, a noisy channel, and an observa-\ntion sequence‚Äîis encoded as an FST. For simplicity of im-plementation, we reverse the direction of the model. Our re-\nverse implementation is equivalent to the formal deÔ¨Ånition\ndue to the closure of FSTs under inversion.\nOur implementation is the composition\nScore‚ó¶ScoreEdit‚ó¶Cycles\nof FSTs representing chords in the observation sequence,\nchord edits in the noisy channel, and a model of (theoret-\nical) cycles, respectively. We use the OpenFst library [1]\nimplementation of FSTs and the Viterbi algorithm with the\ntropical semiring to calculate the path of lowest cost from\nScore toCycles . This scheme is appropriate to our transi-\ntions, which use weights rather than probabilities.\n2.2.1 Score\nScore is the FST over Œ£1that represents the observation\nsequence. As shown in Figure 1, Score accepts and outputs\nexactly the string corresponding to our input data with no\npenalty. Its construction is simple to automate, since each\ntransition from the start state to the Ô¨Ånal state corresponds\nto a triad in the input (in order). While we have not used this\ncapability, our model can accommodate multiple weighted\nanalyses of a piece, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 1 . The Score FST representing the score ‚ÄúC G C.‚Äù\nFigure 2 . An FST representing a probabilistic encoding of\ntwo possible analyses of a hypothetical score.\n2.2.2 ScoreEdit\nScoreEdit is the FST that represents the noisy channel (in\nreverse). It transduces from Œ£1toŒ£1‚à™Œ£3and is deÔ¨Åned as\nScoreEdit =AddBrackets‚ó¶TriadsEdit, (1)\nwhere AddBrackets andTriadsEdit are two smaller FSTs\ndescribed below.\nAddBrackets , shown in Figure 3, is a formatting step\nthat demarcates cycles by inserting non-overlapping pairs\nof brackets into the score. In order to prevent an excessive\nnumber of cycles, we associate a cost Bwith the insertion\n40012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nof a bracket pair, denoted /epsilon1: [/B, meaning ‚ÄúDo not read an\ninput chord. Add a bracket, at cost B.‚Äù A transition labeled\nŒ£1: Œ£1/0is shorthand for all possible transitions labeled\nœÉi:œÉi/0such thatœÉi‚ààŒ£1.\nFigure 3 . The AddBrackets FST.\nBracketing cycles in this way enables TriadsEdit to per-\nform edits on the score that are sensitive to cycle boundaries.\nTriadsEdit operates over Œ£1‚à™Œ£3and is deÔ¨Åned as\nTriadsEdit =OutsideEdit¬∑(OpenBracket\n¬∑InsideEdit¬∑ClosedBracket\n¬∑OutsideEdit )‚àó,(2)\nwhere OpenBracket andClosedBracket are simple two-\nstate FSTs that recognize the languages {[}and{]}, re-\nspectively. As shown in Figure 4, OutsideEdit is a single-\nstate FST over Œ£1that deletes any number of triads (with\ncostX), andInsideEdit is a single-state FST over Œ£1that\ndeletes, inserts, and reads any number of triads (with costs\nD,I, and 0, respectively). By construction of Equation (2),\nOutsideEdit operates only outside of cycles, InsideEdit\noperates only inside cycles, and zero or more cycles can oc-\ncur anywhere in the score. We describe a method of training\nthese weights (costs) in Section 3.2.\nFigure 4 . The OutsideEdit (left) and InsideEdit (right)\nFSTs.\n2.2.3 Cycles\nCycles is the FST from Œ£1‚à™Œ£3toŒ£2‚à™Œ£3. It transduces\nneo-Riemannian transformations from the cycles and is de-\nÔ¨Åned as\nCycles = (OpenBracket¬∑Map¬∑ClosedBracket )‚àó\n‚ó¶(OpenBracket¬∑DeÔ¨Ånitions\n¬∑ClosedBracket )‚àó,(3)\nwhere Map andDeÔ¨Ånitions are the FSTs described below.Map transduces from Œ£1toŒ£2and converts triads into\ntransformations. It has a start state with transitions to each\nof the 24 other states corresponding to the major and minor\ntriads. Each state corresponding to a triad is a Ô¨Ånal state, and\nhas outgoing transitions to three other states according to P,\nL, andRtransformations. Whenever Map in the start state\nreads a triad corresponding to a particular state, it moves to\nthat state and outputs /epsilon1(with cost 0). From there, it is able\nto read successive triads and output the appropriate transfor-\nmation symbols. For clarity, Figure 5 shows only a portion\nofMap corresponding to an LRP cycle, which contains 6\nout of the 24 possible triads.\nFigure 5 . The Map FST (abbreviated).\nDeÔ¨Ånitions is the FST over Œ£2that recognizes any de-\nÔ¨Åned neo-Riemannian cycle. By construction, Equation (3)\nensures that one of those cycles occurs within each set of\nbrackets. DeÔ¨Ånitions is the union of all FSTs that represent\na desired cycle, like the one shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6 . TheLPCycle FST. Each transition exiting the\nstart state is shorthand for the transitions and intermediary\n(non-Ô¨Ånal) states necessary to transduce the labeled sub-\nstring to itself with zero weight.\n2.3 Generalizability\nOur model is highly generalizable, and could be adapted to\nrecognize various properties in a variety of music-theoretic\nsystems. One could deÔ¨Åne new edit operations by modifying\n401Poster Session 3\nScoreEdit , incorporate other types of harmonies [6, 7] or\ntransformations [5,8], or change Map to accommodate other\nconceptions of harmonic distance [20]. One could envision\nusing our model to detect cycles in other music features such\nas rhythm (where the symbols might be durations rather than\nneo-Riemannian transformations), and patterns other than\ncycles.\n3. EXPERIMENT\n3.1 Input Data\nWe were able to obtain only a small quantity of input data\nfrom scores in the desired corpus of late Romantic music\nscores, to which neo-Riemannian analysis is typically ap-\nplied. Neither a dataset of harmonic analyses, nor a reliable\nway of automatically converting music scores into analyses\nis presently available. Thus, the Ô¨Årst author performed all\nanalyses manually prior to the automated analysis. Seventh\nand other extended chords were reduced to their underlying\ntriads, and vertical sonorities without a prominent major or\nminor triad identity were ignored.\nOur input data are selections from four works by Franz\nSchubert in which [17] identiÔ¨Åes LPandRPcycles. [17]\nanalyzes two LPcycles in the exposition of the Ô¨Årst move-\nment of the A major Piano Sonata, D. 959, one LPcycle in\nthe fourth movement of the G major Piano Sonata, D. 894,\noneLPcycle in the coda of the Ô¨Årst movement of the E-\nÔ¨Çat major Piano Trio, D. 929, and one RPcycle in the Ô¨Årst\nmovement of the C major String Quintet, D. 956. Since the\nfocus of this experiment is LPandRPcycles, we deÔ¨Åne the\nDeÔ¨Ånitions FST to recognize either one. Given the small\nsize of our dataset, it was not necessary to perform the usual\ndeterminization and minimization algorithms to make the\nFSTs in our model time- and space-efÔ¨Åcient, respectively.\nIn order to describe and classify the cycles that comprise\nour ground truth, we identify properties of cycles that are\nvisible to our model. Let pbe the number of triads in an\nobservable cycle that are labeled with transformations, let o\nbe the number of triads that are not labeled (insertions), and\nletn=o+pbe the overall length. Also, let mbe the number\nof deletions, and let lbe the length of the shortest complete\ntheoretical cycle of the type being labeled (e.g. l= 7forLP\ncycles). Note that p+m=l, except for extended cycles,\nwherep+m>l . Table 1 shows o,m,p, andlfor each of\nthe cycles in our input data.\nWe also calculate two quantities in Table 1 that help us\nto classify cycles.o\no+pis the proportion of insertions rela-\ntive to the observable length, andm\nm+pis the proportion of\ndeletions relative to the length of the corresponding theoret-\nical cycle. We will use these two quantities, also graphed in\nFigure 8, to explain our results.Piece Measures o m p lo\no+pm\nm+p\nD. 959 (ex. 1) 28‚Äì36 9 4 5 7 0.64 0.44\nD. 959 (ex. 2) 82‚Äì103 24 0 9 7 0.73 0\nD. 894 154‚Äì160 21 3 4 7 0.84 0.43\nD. 956 233‚Äì250 9 2 7 9 0.56 0.22\nD. 929 585‚Äì612 9 0 7 7 0.56 0\nTable 1 . Cycles in the ground truth and their properties.\n3.2 Training Method\nTraining our model consists of setting four parameters: B,\nD,X, andI, which are the costs of bracketing cycles, delet-\ning chords inside cycles, deleting chords outside of cycles,\nand inserting chords, respectively (described in Section 2.2).\nWhile systems can be trained with musically-informed rules [19],\nwe calculate weights empirically. Our method involves set-\nting up a system of linear inequalities by determining the\nbehavior of our system over isolated strings of ntriads.\nTo privilege labeling a cycle of ntriads over deletion, we\nuse equations of the form\nB+oD+mI <nX. (4)\nTo privilege deletion, we would simply reverse the inequal-\nity. We generate instances of Equation (4) from a ground\ntruth labeling of a score by selecting each cycle and calcu-\nlatingo,m, andn. In order to prevent our system from\narbitrarily extending cycles it labels, we also require that\nD>X. (5)\nWe solve the resulting system by minimizing the objective\nfunctionB+D+I+X.\n3.3 Evaluation\nThe desired performance metric should measure the success\nof both segmentation and labeling of cycles.\nWe propose an evaluation method that uses global string\nalignment applied separately to each region in the score with\none or more overlapping cycles in either the ground truth or\nthe prediction. Since a string of transformations does not\nuniquely determine the underlying triads, we do not com-\npare those strings. Instead, we calculate the edit distance\nbetween the string of triads labeled with transformations\n(i.e. not insertions) in the prediction with the corresponding\nstring in the ground truth. Allowable edit distance opera-\ntions are insertion and deletion, like in our model. If a cycle\ndoes not exist in one labeling, the edit distance is simply the\ncost of deleting all symbols in the other string. This metric\nhas the property that segmentation errors are proportional to\npand noto; it is a measure of divergence in transformational\ncontent rather than overall observable content.\n40212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nPiece 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 SnSpSt\nD. 959 5 460 5 4 16 20\nD. 894 8 10 6 8 10 22 32\nD. 956 6 5 9 7 07 6 5 0 45 45\nD. 929 6 5 6 7 8 7 7 8 4 7 2 2 65 67\nTable 2 .

SnandSp\nmeasure in some sense the amount of ‚Äúfalse-negativeness‚Äù\nand ‚Äúfalse-positiveness,‚Äù respectively, in a prediction.\nWe use leave-one-out cross-validation on our four pieces\nof input data. Training for validation on D. 959, D. 956,\nand D. 929 each yielded weights I= 1,B= 1,D=\n1.0065 , andX= 1.0055 , and training for validation on\nD. 894 yielded weights I= 1,B= 1,D= 1.003, and\nX= 1.002. Table 2 shows a breakdown of performance by\naligned region for each score.\n4. RESULTS\nIn our experiment, we used the cycles analyzed by [17] as\nour ‚Äúground truth.‚Äù If we deÔ¨Åne successful retrieval of a\ncycle in the ground truth as prediction of a cycle in the\nsame aligned region, our model achieved precision and re-\ncall scores of 0.18 and 1.0. (The model predicted a cycle in\nevery aligned region containing a cycle in the ground truth.)\nThe cycles recalled from the ground truth, on average, had\nlengthp= 6.4and alignment score 3.2.\nOur choice of ground truth cycles impacted our preci-\nsion score and led to many predicted cycles in regions not\nanalyzed. Viewed as strings of harmonies, these predicted\ncycles are difÔ¨Åcult to distinguish from cycles in the ground\ntruth. In particular, our model predicted an RP cycle in\nmeasures 304‚Äì329 (aligned region 7) of D. 929 with dimen-\nsionso= 8,m= 2,p= 7, andl= 9, which almost exactly\nmatch the dimensions of the ground truth RP cycle in D.\n956 (see Table 1). We arrive at the conclusion that either\nthe ground truth is incomplete, or that other factors affect\ntheorists‚Äô decisions on what constitutes a cycle.\nOur model also labels cycles on a more detailed level\nthan is often done in music analysis. In practice, theorists\noften describe transformations acting on a cluster of chords\nwith a prominent harmonic identity, rather than a particu-\nlar chord with that identity. By contrast, our model always\nlabels speciÔ¨Åc chords with transformations. Our evaluation\nmeasure does not penalize this type of over-speciÔ¨Åcation.Aligned region 5 of D. 956, which received one of two per-\nfect alignment scores, illustrates this point. In translating the\nanalysis in [17] to the ground truth labeling, the Ô¨Årst author\nselected the second D major chord shown in Figure 7 for\nparticipation in the theoretical cycle based on cadential and\ninversional information in the score. Our model selected the\nÔ¨Årst D major chord instead, but was not penalized by con-\nstruction of our evaluation method.\nFigure 7 . Aligned region 5 of D. 956 (mm. 233‚Äì250), with\nground truth labels (curved connectors) and predicted labels\n(elbow connectors).\nWhile our model predicted a cycle in each aligned re-\ngion containing a cycle in the ground truth, misalignments\nof varying severity also occurred. The predicted cycles in\naligned region 11 of D. 929, aligned region 2 of D. 959,\nand aligned region 2 of D. 894 received increasingly large\nevaluation scores. These increasing scores reÔ¨Çect the costs\nof identifying an extended cycle, a cycle with the desired\nharmonic content but opposite direction, and a cycle with\naltogether different harmonic content, respectively.\nIn order to understand why these cycles posed challenges\nto our model, consider Figure 8. Distance from the origin\ncorrelates with the alignment scores of these three cycles.\nIn addition, there seems to be a direct link between distance\nfrom thex-axis (corresponding to the relative number of\ndeletions) and poor performance. Tellingly, the three cycles\nwith the best scores (aligned region 4 of D. 959, aligned\nregion 5 of D. 956, and aligned region 11 of D. 929) are\nlocated on or near the x-axis, but not particularly near the\ny-axis, suggesting that the model is able to handle many in-\nserted triads, so long as there are few deletions. The two\nremaining cycles in the Ô¨Ågure, located furthest from the x-\naxis, were more costly to align. Each consists of strictly\nT2transformations, resulting in many deletions. The Ô¨Ånite-\nstate model is not in general well-equipped to reward regu-\nlarity in patterns, and in this case was not able to recognize\nregularity of motion within a cycle.\nTo view the complete set of musical excerpts and ex-\ntracted harmonic analyses, please visit http://www.\njonathanbragg.com/ismir2011 .\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nNetwork analysis has become a signiÔ¨Åcant tool for under-\nstanding the dynamics of complex systems. Social network\nanalysis, in particular, has increasingly garnered the atten-\ntion of researchers across sociology, computer science, and\nstatistics. Within the music information retrieval commu-\nnity, this has led to the creation of artist collaboration, rec-\nommendation, similarity, and inÔ¨Çuence networks.\nEarly music-based networks are found in Cano and Kop-\npenberger [1] and Cano et al. [2]. Similarity networks from\nvarious online data sources are constructed with results show-\ning the potential of how network analysis can help design\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.recommendation systems. Further work of Jacobson [3, 4]\nand Fields [5,6] continued to show applications of automatic\nplaylist generation, artist community detection, musicology,\nand sociology. Most recently, Collins investigated what is\npresumably the Ô¨Årst computational analysis of musical in-\nÔ¨Çuence using web scraping, web services, and audio simi-\nlarity to construct inÔ¨Çuence graphs of a collection of synth\npop music [7]. The work outlines the difÔ¨Åculty of construct-\ning inÔ¨Çuence networks and motivates further investigation.\nFigure 1 . Visualization of Genre Flow. The size and opacity\nof a directed edge indicates the relative Ô¨Çow of samples from\none genre to another.\nThe musicological and sociological impact of musical in-\nÔ¨Çuence has considerable scope. Understanding how artists,\nmusical styles, and music itself evolves over time can help\nus understand the creative process of music-making. Over-\nall inÔ¨Çuence rank is also of considerable attraction, as music\ncritics continually create top artist or producer lists within\n329Oral Session 4: Web\npopular music (e.g. Rolling Stone Magazine). We present\nwork towards this goal by studying inÔ¨Çuence found within\nsample-based music.1Directed inÔ¨Çuence graphs are con-\nstructed using a dataset from WhoSampled.com [8], a music\nwebsite that chronicles sampling behavior via a community\nof contributors. Network analysis metrics and visualization\nsuch as Fig. 1 are employed on song, artist, and genre inÔ¨Çu-\nence graphs in an effort to gain musicological understand-\ning of the compositional act of sampling. In addition, a\nmethod of inÔ¨Çuence rank and analysis is proposed to help\nunify song-level networks to higher-level artist and genre\nnetworks via a collapse-and-sum approach. Empirical re-\nsults found on constructed network graphs suggest musical\ninÔ¨Çuence-based networks follow a power-law degree distri-\nbution; heavy inÔ¨Çuence of funk, soul, and disco music on\nmodern hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music; and various\nother anecdotal discussions of the unique corpus.\n2. UNIQUE DATASET\nThe dataset was provided in agreement with WhoSampled.com\nand provides 42,447 user-generated records of sampling, ex-\ncluding any entry involving cover song sampling. A base-\nline entry or sample of the dataset consists of a song-artist\ndestination (who sampled the musical material) and song-\nartist source (source of the musical material sampled). In\naddition, other meta-data is provided, including destination\nand source release year, collaborating artists, featured artists,\nproducers, genre, and part-sampled (i.e. vocals, drums, etc.).\nFor the purposes of this work, it is assumed that the large,\nhigh-quality dataset is a good representation of sampling be-\nhavior found within modern popular music and independent\nof any form of bias imposed by the user community. Labels\nof genre include hip-hop/R&B (H), electronic dance (E),\nrock/pop (P), soul/funk/disco (F), jazz/blues (J), reggae (R),\ncountry (C), world (W), soundtrack (S), classical (L), spo-\nken word (K), easy listening (Y), gospel (G), and other (O).\nThe part-sampled labels include: whole track (W), drum\nloop (D), bass line (B), vocals (V), hook (H), or other (O).\n2.1 Genre & Part-Sampled Trends\nTo understand the data, we Ô¨Årst take a look at the genre\nand part-sampled trends. The relative proportions of each\ngenre are plotted in Fig. 2. Hip-hop/R&B, electronic dance,\nrock pop, and soul/funk/disco are dominate sources of mu-\nsical samples, while hip-hop/R&B and electronic music are\ndominate destinations. The relative proportions and counts\nof each part-sampled are (W) 7.20% (3060), (D) 37.25%\n(15811), (B) 33.76% (14329), (V) 2.15% (913), (H) 17.25%\n(7321), (O) 2.39% (1013). Drum and bass components are\n1Within this work, sample-based music is deÔ¨Åned as a musical work\nthat in borrows material from another musical source, whether it be a direct\nmanipulation of a recorded sound or less direct transcribed material.\nFigure 2 .

The size and\nopacity of a directed edge indicates the relative Ô¨Çow of part-\nsampled type to different genres.\nthe most dominant part-sampled followed by hook compo-\nnents.\nFig. 1 and Fig. 3 show more advanced visualizations em-\nphasizing the Ô¨Çow of inÔ¨Çuence between genres [9]. Node\nsize represents the destination proportions, while the directed\nedge opacity and thickness represent the conditional distri-\nbution of source genre given the destination genre. As seen,\nhip-hop/R&B consumes the most samples out of all genres,\nand within hip-hop/R&B most of the source material is from\nsoul, funk, and disco as well as prior hip-hop/R&B material.\nIn addition, it is also noticeable that electronic dance mu-\nsic more likely samples vocal material, while hip-hop/R&B\nmore likely samples an entire portion of a song.\nTo measure how homogeneous the source material is for\neach destination genre, it is useful to employ the concept\nofgenre entropy H , similar to discussions found in Jacob-\nson [3] and Lambiotte [10]. Within this work, genre entropy\nis deÔ¨Åned as\nHgk=‚àí/summationdisplay\ngj‚ààŒìPgj|gklogPgj|gk, (1)\nwheregkis thekthgenre in the set of genres ŒìandPgj|gk\nis the probability of source genre gjgiven the destination\ngenregk.

A closer look at\nelectronic music reveals a near equal split of source ma-\nterial from hip-hop/R&B, electronic music, rock/pop, and\nsoul/funk/disco with a slight preference towards the latter.\nSuch evidence suggests differences in the creative process\nof sampling between genres.\n2.2 Time-Based Trends\nInitial observations of time-based trends are found when we\nview the proportion of samples per year within each genre.\nThe trends can be viewed for both unique source and des-\ntination material normalized by the total instances of sam-\npling as shown in Fig. 4. Plotting unique instances of source\nand destination material indicates general trends within each\ngenre and eliminates the effect of a single popular sample\nswaying the proportions (as is the case without uniqueness\nenforced).\nThe general shape of the source material plot (upper) out-\nlines the musical time frame of each genre (in terms of sam-pled source material), showing a rough outline of the rise\nand fall of soul/funk/disco and the rise of hip-hop/R&B.\nThe general shape of the destination material (lower) out-\nlines the increased popularity of sampling and/or listener\ntrends within the WhoSampled.com user community. In-\nterestingly, there is a sharp decrease in sample-based mu-\nsic centered around 2003. While further investigation is re-\nquired, it interesting to note that this event directly coin-\ncides with the Recording Industry Association of America\n(RIAA) Ô¨Årst litigation on Internet piracy and music copy-\nright infringement [11]. Such legal policy would have cre-\nated a more conservative and limited view of the musical\npractice of sampling, thus signiÔ¨Åcantly affecting the music-\nmaking process.\n3. NETWORK ANALYSIS\nA discussion of network analysis, inÔ¨Çuence measures, and\nrank is presented with the motivation of observing how in-\ndividual songs, artists, and genres inÔ¨Çuence one another.\nComplex network analysis provides signiÔ¨Åcant tools for such\ncharacterization and begins with the formulation of a net-\nwork graph. A graph G= (N,E )is deÔ¨Åned by a set of\nnodesNand edgesEor equivalently an adjacency matrix\nA. A weighted directed edge between node iandjis de-\nÔ¨Åned via Aij=wijand0otherwise, where wijis the cor-\nresponding weight. For unweighted networks, all weights\nare either zero or one.\n3.1 Degree Distributions\nFor a Ô¨Årst general measure of how the music sample-based\nnetworks are constructed, degree centrality can be used to\nmeasure the inÔ¨Çuence from each node (song, artist, or genre)\nof a network. For a given node, the in- and out-degree\ncentrality is deÔ¨Åned as the respective in or out edge counts\nnormalized by the total number of nodes |N|. The in- and\nout-degree distribution is then the proportion of degree k=\n1,2,3,...nodes and can be used to characterize the network.\nPower-law distributions f(k)‚àùk‚àíŒ≥are an important\nfamily of distributions. Such distributions promote the con-\ncept of preferential attachment and are referred to as scale-\nfree. To test the hypothesis that musical sampling follows\na power-law, we can construct an unweighted acyclic song\nnetwork using unique songs as nodes and sampling instances\nto create directed edges from destination to source. The\nin-degree distribution can then be computed and tested to\nfollow a power-law distribution or not. Using methods de-\nscribed in [12], we Ô¨Ånd that the network is consistent with\nthe hypothesis (p-value =.16fork‚â•3andŒ≥= 2.72) and\nshow the cumulative in-degree distribution in Fig. 5.\nIn terms of networks based on musical sampling, a scale-\nfree network suggests the idea that very popular samples\nwill only continue to increase in popularity. In addition, if\n331Oral Session 4: Web\nFigure 5 . Cumulative In-degree Distribution P(k)of the\nSample-Based Song Network (log-log scale).\nany of the very popular samples were to be removed, large\nportions of sample-based music would cease to exist (or at\nleast be altered).\n3.2 InÔ¨Çuence Measures\nTo analyze and rank inÔ¨Çuence within each network, four\nclosely related measures are commonly used: degree cen-\ntrality, eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, and PageR-\nank. Degree centrality does not capture any indirect form of\ninÔ¨Çuence (as in the case of sample chains), motivating alter-\nnative methods. Eigenvector centrality extends degree cen-\ntrality by weighting the importance of neighboring nodes to\nallow for indirect inÔ¨Çuence, but has limited application for\nacyclic networks [13].2Katz centrality and PageRank ap-\npropriately modify eigenvector centrality. Both also provide\na mechanism to capture indirect inÔ¨Çuence between nodes,\ncompute an overall inÔ¨Çuence rank among each node, and\nobserve the inÔ¨Çuence of one node to another. PageRank,\nhowever, down-weights inÔ¨Çuence created by a destination\nnode that samples more than once, or in the case of artist\nnodes, down-weights inÔ¨Çuence from artists with lengthy ca-\nreers. While this is desirable in numerous other contexts\nsuch as web search, we wish to equally weight each instance\nof sampling and restrict ourselves to Katz centrality.\nThe Katz inÔ¨Çuence matrix IKis deÔ¨Åned via\nIK= (I‚àíŒ±A)‚àí1‚àíI (2)\nwhereIis an identity matrix, Ais the adjacency matrix as\nbefore, andŒ±is a decay factor which scales the indirect in-\nÔ¨Çuence allowed to propagate though the network (larger Œ±\nimplies greater weight on indirect inÔ¨Çuence). This can be\nwritten in equivalent form as\nIK=Œ±A+Œ±2A2+...+Œ±kAk+..., (3)\nwhere we can see that the inÔ¨Çuence is a weighted sum of\nthe powers of the adjacency matrix [14]. When the values\nofAare zero or one, the powers of the adjacency matrix\n2The song network is exactly acyclic and the artist network is nearly\nacyclic.Akhave elements representing the number of sample chains\nof corresponding length kcapturing various levels of indi-\nrect inÔ¨Çuence. For stability, 1/Œ±must be greater than the\nlargest eigenvalue of Aand for large networks, (2) becomes\nincreasingly difÔ¨Åcult to invert. Typically, only the overall in-\nÔ¨Çuence rank is desired and is computed iteratively in a fash-\nion to avoid a large memory footprint and matrix inverse\nrequired for IK.\nFor our purposes, it is desirable to have both the entire in-\nÔ¨Çuence matrix and overall rank. Given IK, we can view the\ncolumn of a node to Ô¨Ånd who inÔ¨Çuenced the node, or view\nthe row of the node to Ô¨Ånd who the node inÔ¨Çuenced [15].\nSumming the columns of the inÔ¨Çuence matrix produces a\nranking of the most inÔ¨Çuential nodes, while summing the\nrows results in a ranking of the most inÔ¨Çuenced nodes. Such\nanalysis is nicely suited for musicological analysis and mo-\ntivates further improvements discussed below.\n3.3 Collapse-and-Sum InÔ¨Çuence Rank\nFor the given dataset, we would like to understand and ana-\nlyze song, artist, and genre inÔ¨Çuence individually, as well as\nhow each network relates to one another. To do so, individ-\nual networks can be constructed for song, artist, and genre\nnetworks with inÔ¨Çuence matrices and rank computed via (2)\nor (3). Building separate graphs, however, has several draw-\nbacks. Most notably, there is no straightforward mechanism\nto relate the inÔ¨Çuence matrices of each network together ap-\npropriately. Furthermore, we would like to model the inÔ¨Çu-\nence propagation on the song-level topology and then derive\nartist and genre inÔ¨Çuence measures, as the compositional act\nof sampling is presumably based on the musical material it-\nself, rather than artist or genre connections.\nTo address this issue, a single inÔ¨Çuence matrix is con-\nstructed using the song-level network (see Section 3.1) and\nis used to create the artist and genre inÔ¨Çuence matrices, re-\nsulting in the proposed relational collapse-and-sum approach.\nTo construct the artist-level inÔ¨Çuence matrix IAfrom the\nsong-level network, the song-level network is Ô¨Årst used to\ncompute the song inÔ¨Çuence matrix IS. Given IS, we then\ncompute a derived artist inÔ¨Çuence matrix IA, knowing the\nsource and destination song sets Ss\naiandSd\naibelonging to\neach artistai. To do so, we take each artist aiin the set of\nartistsAand\n‚Ä¢Sum over the destination song sets of each artist Sd\nai,\ncollapsing the appropriate columns of IS.\n‚Ä¢Sum over the source song set of each artist Ss\nai, col-\nlapsing the appropriate rows of IS.\nThe result of the process produces an artist-level inÔ¨Çuence\nmatrixIAwhich is directly derived from the song-level mu-\nsical material, and is done so via linear combinations of the\nsong-level inÔ¨Çuence matrix. The process can be duplicated\n33212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nor further reduced for other relations, such as artist-to-genre\nand song-to-genre inÔ¨Çuence.\nGiven the linear relationship from one network to the\nother, we can compute the relative proportions of inÔ¨Çuence\nbetween networks. As a result, we can analyze how in-\nÔ¨Çuential a given song is to an overall artist‚Äôs inÔ¨Çuence or\nhow inÔ¨Çuential an artist is to a genre by taking ratios be-\ntween the respective inÔ¨Çuence graphs, among other tasks.\nSecondly, by solely computing the inÔ¨Çuence on the acyclic,\nunweighted song-level network, we can compute ISfrom a\nshort, Ô¨Ånite linear combination of the powers of the adja-\ncency matrix without any iterative procedure and by know-\ning that the powers of the adjacency matrix Ak,k= 1,2,3...\nwill go to zero when kis greater than the maximum sample\nchain length of the network. With sparse matrix represen-\ntations, this modiÔ¨Åcation can greatly reduced computation,\nincrease the allowable in-memory network size, and addi-\ntionally releases any restriction on Œ±, allowing the user to\nchoose any suitable weighting function. Application of this\napproach is found below in Section 4.\n4. APPLICATION\nThree levels of inÔ¨Çuence analysis and rank are computed for\nsong, artist, and genre representations, providing a small-to-\nlarge inspection of the data. Various values of Œ±are used to\ncompare direct to indirect inÔ¨Çuence. For this purpose, (3) is\nrescaled to IK=A+Œ±1A2+...+Œ±k‚àí1Ak+..., allowing\nŒ±= 0to only account for direct sampling, Œ±= 1to equally\naccount for direct and all indirect sampling, and values be-\ntween zero and one to preferentially weight direct samples,\nbut also account for indirect sampling.\n4.1 Song InÔ¨Çuence\nThe song-level inÔ¨Çuence matrix ISis computed from the\nsong network described in Section 3.1. The most inÔ¨Çuential\nsongs are found in Table 2. We can observe the presence of\nmany popular samples including ‚ÄúChange the Beat‚Äù by Fab\n5 Freddy and the ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù break by The Winstons. It is par-\nticularly interesting to note that, for the ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù break, as Œ±\nincreases, the credit of inÔ¨Çuence intuitively moves from The\nWinstons to The Impressions, and Ô¨Ånally to Jester Hairston.\nThis is a result of a sample chain between material origi-\nnating from Jester Hairston, that was Ô¨Årst sampled by The\nImpressions, and then massively popularized by The Win-\nstons.\n4.2 Artist InÔ¨Çuence\nStarting with the song-level inÔ¨Çuence, we can collapse IS\nto form an artist-based inÔ¨Çuence matrix IA.

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK\nOptical music recognition (OMR) is an active Ô¨Åeld, but suf-\nfers from a number of technical pitfalls, even in the ‚Äútyp-\nical‚Äù case where only music notation in modern, conven-\ntional western style is considered [3,8,13]. While affordable\ncommercial tools for OMR are available, imperfections in\nscanned sheet music make these error-prone (see Fig. 1).\nOne possibility for improving the accuracy of OMR pro-\ngrams is to use multiple recognizers : Let several programs\n(recognizers ) perform OMR independepently, and combine\nthe results afterwards using a combined recognizer .

Right: The output of Capella-Scan\n1.6.\npractical possibility of using multiple recognizers has been\ninvestigated by Byrd et al. [5‚Äì7], and appears promising, but\nbrings new pitfalls with it; in extreme cases, OMR programs\ncould fail dismally at different tasks, hence‚Äìin theory‚Äìmaking\nthe combined result worse than the output of the individual\nrecognizer.\nIn contrast, we take a workmanlike approach to multi-\nple recognizers: The basic tenet is that every commercially\navailable tool will not fail dismally on a single aspect of\nOMR in most cases (the product would be too poor to use),\nand that different tools are likely to fail in different aspects.\nByrd et al. [6,7] suggest amassing a set of rules, or attaching\nweights to certain single recognizers, based on their prior\nperformance, to obtain maximal increase of accuracy in a\nmulti-recognizer tool; however, they also note that this is\na moving target, due to new versions of existing products\nimproving on some aspect of recognition. In contrast, we\nare simply satisÔ¨Åed if a multi-recognizer is, on average, bet-\nter than any single-recognizer, to a high degree of statistical\nsigniÔ¨Åcance .\nTo account for the fact that different recognizers may\nmake different errors, hence causing misalignment of their\nrespective outputs (see Fig. 2) we align their outputs using\na multiple sequence alignment algorithm and subsequently\nuse a simple voting procedure to resolve conÔ¨Çicts. A pre-\nrequisite for such an approach to work is that no single rec-\nognizer signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the others, as a multiple\nrecognizer would then perform worse as the suboptimal rec-\n405Poster Session 3\nFigure 2 .

Our\nresults are thus restricted to aspects of melody and harmony;\nwe thus consider only notes, rests, bars, keys, etc., but omit\ndynamic indications (p, pp, etc.) and the‚Äìadmittedly more\ndifÔ¨Åcult‚Äìproblem of slurs and complex annotations.\n1.1 Related work\nByrd et al. [5‚Äì7] report on several experiments using an\nOMR system based on several different recognizers, includ-\ning a prototype system for sequence alignment, but do not\ngive details on the numerical improvement of the multi-recog-\nnizer system. Szwoch [15] uses alignment within bars to au-\ntomatically obtain error counts for OMR systems, but does\nnot give numerical evidence. Pardo and Sanghi [12] em-\nploy multiple sequence alignment to Ô¨Ånd optimal matching\nworks in databases of polyphonic music when queried with\nmonophonic pieces; they consider an alphabet where each\nmusical symbol is a note with pitch and duration, and each\npart in a polyphonic score corresponds to a sequence. Al-\nlali et al. substantially extend this approach to encompass\npolyphonic queries [1, 2].\nWhile the work of Byrd et al. is very similar to ours, we\nbelieve our work offers the following incremental beneÔ¨Åts:\n(i) conÔ¨Årmation of the positive results obtained in the exper-\niments of Byrd et al., (ii) comparison of different commer-\ncial tools with each other and with a system based on multi-\nple recognizers with statistical signiÔ¨Åcance testing, (iii) full,\nnumerical reporting of results, (iv) full release of all tools\nas open-source software, including the MusicXiMpLe XML\nSchema DeÔ¨Ånition (XSD) and sequence alignment software.\nMusicXML\nResult in\nMusicXiMpLeResulting\nsequenceAligned\nsequencesSequencesMusicXiMpLe\nSequencerVoterSequence alignerSequencerConverterFigure 3 .

ALIGNMENT OF OUTPUT FROM MULTIPLE\nRECOGNIZERS: PRACTICAL OVERVIEW\nOur combined recognizer takes the output from several rec-\nognizers in a common format, converts the output to sev-\neral sequences of musical symbols which are then aligned\nwith conÔ¨Çicts resolved by majority (colloquially: ‚ÄúThe pro-\ngrams vote for the symbols‚Äù after alignment); the resulting\nsequence is then converted to the common format (see Fig.\n3.\nWe employed four commercial recognizers: Capella-Scan\n6.1, SmartScore X Pro 10.2.6, PhotoScore Ultimate 6, and\nSharpEye 2. VivaldiScan was brieÔ¨Çy investigated, but dis-\ncarded as it (for our purposes) was only a wrapper for the\nOMR procedures of SharpEye. All tools support several\noutput formats; we chose MusicXML as all programs sup-\nport it and the format is amenable to manipulation.\nTheconverter converts MusicXML to a standard format\ncalled MusicXiMpLe (see Section 2.1) with the purpose of\nnormalizing notation. The sequencer converts MusicXiM-\npLe to an internal representation of music as a sequence\nof symbols (see Section 3.1). The Sequence aligner (see\nSection 3.2) uses multiple sequence alignment to align the\nsequences, and the Voter is used to settle disputes among\nOMR programs after alignment. The Sequencer is then used\nagain to convert from the internal sequence representation to\nthe standard format.\n40612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n2.1 A common output format: MusicXiMpLe\nDue to the ambiguities in MusicXML, a piece of music can\nbe represented in different ways, and different recognizers\nmay output starkly different MusicXML, even if all recog-\nnizers read the music correctly. Furthermore, MusicXML\nis quite verbose, containing more information and metadata\nthan needed for our experiment. To address these issues,\nwe created an XML Schema DeÔ¨Ånition (XSD) containing\nsolely those elements needed for analysis. We call the set of\nXML-data conforming to our XSD ‚ÄúMusicXiMpLe‚Äù; note\nthat valid MusicXiMpLe is also valid MusicXML.\nBrieÔ¨Çy, MusicXiMpLe holds the following data. In con-\ntrast to ordinary MusicXML, restrictions are noted in [square\nbrackets]: (i) parts [each part holds exactly one staff], (ii)\nmeasures [only part-wise structures are allowed, not time-\nwise], (iii) notes [only pitch, duration, octave, alternation\nand simultaneity are recorded], (iv) rests [only duration is\nrecorded], (v) the MusicXML ‚Äúmusical counter‚Äù, (vi) re-\npeats and alternative endings, (vii) time-signature, (viii) key,\n(ix) chord symbols.\n3. MUSICAL SYMBOLS AND MUSIC DATA AS A\nSEQUENCE\nSequence alignment is the task of comparing and aligning\nn > 1sequences of symbols. As an example, consider the\nsequencess1ands2constructed using the symbol set {A,B,\nC,D,E}:\ns1=AABBCCDA\ns2=ABCE\nSequence alignment of s1ands2might give the following\nresult (depending on the algorithm used):\na1=AABBCCDA\na2=-AB-CE--\nwherea1anda2represents the aligned sequences of s1and\ns2respectively and ‚Äô -‚Äô represents a gap inserted by the align-\nment algorithm.\nSequence alignment algorithms calculate similarity scores\nfor the elements in the sequences; high similarity will occur\nat points in a score where two recognizers output the same\nsymbols, for instance barlines in the same place. These\nscores are then used to align the sequences. When given\nNsequences as input, multiple sequence alignment returns\nNaligned sequences, possibly with gaps inserted. In our\ncase, this corresponds to Naligned scores; we will reduce\nthese to a single score, by letting each recognizers ‚Äúvote‚Äù for\neach single element in the Naligned sequences (ties broken\nrandomly).3.1 Symbolic music data as a sequence\nWe consider music data as any sequence of elements ewhere\neis generated from the following grammar:\ne:= note+|rest|barline|repeat|ending|key|\ntime|clef\nAnote above is a quadruple (p,a,o,l )wherep‚àà{A,...,G}\nis the pitch class ,a‚àà{Ô¨Çat,natural,sharp}thealterna-\ntion,o‚àà{0,..., 9}theoctave , andl‚ààQtheduration of\nthe note. An element holds one or more notes, hence may\nfunction as a chord. The notes in an element may have dif-\nferent lengths (see Fig. 4). Intuitively, the sequence has an\nelement for each ‚Äúchange‚Äù in the music. With chords con-\ntaining notes of different lengths, a single note missed by a\nrecognizer may lead to very distinct sequences of elements\nfor two different recognizers (this problem is addressed in\nthe sequence alignment, as similarity scores between ele-\nments are computed in such a way that elements that only\ndiffer by ‚Äúfew‚Äù notes are counted ‚Äúalmost similar‚Äù).\nFigure 4 . Bars 11‚Äì12 of ‚ÄúO Christmas tree!‚Äù by E. An-\nsch¬®utz . Elements of the sequence alphabet are indicated by\nred outlines (accidentals and duration are included in each\nelement).\nWe consider each staff to hold a single sequence of sym-\nbols, and perform sequence alignment per-staff. For sheet\nmusic with notes where it is unclear to which staff a given\nnote belongs, different recognizers may assign notes to dif-\nferent staves, negatively affecting subsequent sequence align-\nment.\n3.2 Progressive sequence alignment of symbolic music\ndata and voting\nWe brieÔ¨Çy outline the method for multiple sequence align-\nment below. Note that our choice of algorithms is not due\nto any intrinsic properties of symbolic music; the employed\n407Poster Session 3\nalgorithms could very likely be replaced by other algorithms\nfrom the sequence alignment literature without detrimental\neffect to correctness or performance.\nDue to its tradeoff between speed and precision, we em-\nploy progressive multiple sequence alignment [16] in which\n(a) pair-wise alignment of all sequence-pairs is performed,\nfollowed by (b) computation of a similarity-score Dfor each\npair, and (c) the two most similar are aligned Ô¨Årst, producing\ntwo new sequences that are then (d) progressively aligned\nwith the remaining sequences in descending order of simi-\nlarity score.\nProgressive alignment is greedy and non-optimal‚Äìas op-\nposed to dynamic programming methods‚Äìbut is signiÔ¨Åcantly\nfaster. For pairwise alignment, we use the classic Needleman-\nWunsch algorithm [11]. This method Ô¨Ånds the alignment of\ntwo sequences s1ands2of lengthkandlby Ô¨Årst creat-\ning the similarity matrix MdeÔ¨Åned by the (k+ 1,l+ 1) -\ndimensional matrix Mi,jwhereM0,j=g¬∑j, and\nMi,j= max/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleMi‚àí1,j‚àí1+Œ±(s1[i],s2[j])\nMi‚àí1,j+g\nMi,j‚àí1+g(1)\nwherei‚àà {0,1,...,k},j‚àà {0,1,...,l}, the function\nŒ±(x,y)returns a score based on whether the two elements\nxandyare similar or not, and gis the gap penalty which\nis the score of inserting a gap into one of the sequences. In\naddition, the algorithm maintains a trace matrix Tof iden-\ntical dimensions. This matrix holds information about how\nthe value of each element in Mwas found. If for example\nthe value of M1,2isM0,1+Œ±(s1[1],s2[2]),T1,2will hold\nthe coordinates (0,1).\nFor two musical elements e1,e2, we deÔ¨Åne their similar-\nity asŒ±(e1,e2) =dif the elements are completely distinct,\nandŒ±(e1,e2) =ks/n if the elements are similar, where\nnis the combined number of symbols in e1ande2, andk\nis the number of symbols they have in common (note that\nnotes of identical pitch, but different length are counted as\nbeing distinct). The parameters g,dandscan be set accord-\ning to preference or performance. All our experiments were\nconducted with g=‚àí2,d=‚àí1ands= 1. To avoid spuri-\nous ‚Äúelements‚Äù containing notes in combinations with time\nsignatures, bar lines or clefs, such combinations were heav-\nily penalized by setting their similarity scores effectively to\n‚àí‚àû.\nWhen the matrices MandThave been constructed, pair-\nwise alignment proceeds by following the path from Tk,l\nback toT0,0using the coordinates stored in the cells of T.\nIn the example above, the returned solution is a1=ABBCE ,\na2=A--CD .\nTo extend the pairwise alignment to multiple alignent, a\nso-called guide is constructed that speciÔ¨Åes the sequence in\nwhich pairwise alignments are performed. The guide is con-\nstructed by the standard technique of neighbor-joining [14].ABBC E\n0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10\nA-2 1 -1 -3 -5 -7\nC-4 -1 0 -2 -2 -4\nD-6 -3 -2 -1 -3 -3\nFigure 5 .

For\na symbol to be included in the Ô¨Ånal output, it must have an\nabsolute majority (exceptions are clefs and time signatures\nthat only need half the votes, as we found that the existing\nrecognizers tend to miss them).\n4. EXPERIMENT\nWe collected a corpus ( Corpus A ) of 25 scanned, public do-\nmain, one-page pieces of western classical music. The cor-\npus consisted solely of western classical music ranked in\n5 groups of 5 each according to quality (1 worst, 5 best;\nsee Fig. 7). The corpus was composed prior to any OMR\nscanning by the various recognizers; the music ranged from\n1‚Äì15 staves with either chords or multiple voices present in\nmost staves. We supplemented Corpus A by acquiring the\n24 scanned pages from the original study of Byrd et al. [6]\n(Corpus B ). This corpus consisted mostly of high-quality\nscans (qualities 3‚Äì5 on our scale) with mostly a single voice\non a single staff. In both corpora, we employed 300DPI\nscans, using the ‚Äúuncleaned‚Äù scans of Corpus B. We ap-\nplied the four commercial products to the combined corpus\nA+B, using Finale Songwriter 2010 to read the output Mu-\nsicXML, and performed error counts by hand.\n4.1 Error counting\nError counting in OMR is notoriously difÔ¨Åcult and ambigu-\nous [3, 4, 6, 9]. Droettboom and Fujinaga [9] and Bellini et\nal. [4] argue that error counting at the level of atomic sym-\nbols such as noteheads, Ô¨Çags etc. is markedly different from\nthe case with composite symbols (beamed notes, chords,\netc.), and that a single error in an atomic symbol may cause\n40812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 7 . Scores of quality 5 (left: Bar 12 of ‚ÄúGod save the\nQueen‚Äù by T.A. Arne) and quality 1 (right: Staff 3, Bar 17\nof ‚ÄúLa Baladine Caprice‚Äù by C.B. Lysberg).\nnumerous errors in composite symbols out of proportion.\nIn addition, there are inherent ambiguities in error counting\n(see Tab. 1). There appears to be no consensus in the lit-\nerature on the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to resolve ambiguities, so we\nchose as a guideline that the sound (pitch, duration, etc.) of\nthe music should be preserved, that is, if a recognizer fails\nto read symbols correctly, but replaces them with identically\nsounding ones (e.g. replacing a whole note rest by two half\nnote rests), we do notcount it as an error. However, to avoid\npenalizing OMR tools for missing the beginning clef or key\nsignature (in which case most or all of the notes in the piece\nwould be counted as in error), we only count oneerror for\nsuch a miss. For potential ambiguities in the error count,\nwe followed a strict disambiguation procedure, described in\nTable 1 along with their resolution.\nOriginal score Post-OMR score Ambiguity (A) and Resolution (R)\n/noteheads.s1/noteheads.s1\n/noteheads.s1\nA: Unclear which of the two notes is miss-\ning.

(Non-exhaustive) list of common ambiguities for\nerror counts and their resolution4.2 Qualitative assessment\nNaked-eye inspection during error counts revealed that all\nrecognizers have errors on most pages. Furthermore, the\ncombined recognizer seems to perform better on Corpus B\nthan on Corpus A, containing mostly single-staff, single-\nvoice music. It would thus appear that sequence alignment\nand voting is impaired by chords, and that a reÔ¨Åned distance\nmetric between ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù chords is needed. Another oppor-\ntunity for improvement is that the sequence alignment is af-\nfected negatively if several recognizers misread a clef: All\nnotes will be dissimilar, to the detriment of the alignment al-\ngorithm; this problem could possibly be avoided by letting\neach recognizer output using a notation format or relative\npitch notation, rather than a music format (where pitches\nare absolute).\n4.3 Quantitative assessment\nFor testing whether one recognizer signiÔ¨Åcantly outperformed\nthe other, we performed an experiment with our two cor-\npora (N= 49 ). To avoid spurious assumptions about the\nnormality of the error rate of each recognizer, we eschewed\nparametric tests and instead performed (a) non-parametric\nFriedman tests on the ensemble of all tools, (b) sign tests\non each pair of recognizers against the null hypothesis that\napplying a pair of recognizers to a random score the recog-\nnizers are equally likely to yield fewer errors than the other.\nBoth tests avoid debatable comparisons of the absolute num-\nber of errors per page, comparing only the relative number\nof errors for each pair of recognizers. Tests were performed\nat signiÔ¨Åcance level of p<. 05.\nRanking the Ô¨Åve recognizers from least errors (rank 1)\nto most errors (rank 5), the combined recognizer (CR) per-\nformed best on average: CR: 2.43, Sharpeye: 2.83, Smart-\nscore: 2.86, Photoscore: 3.26, Capella-Scan: 3.62. The\nFriedman test showed a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the set of\nranks of the Ô¨Åve recognizers ( œá2= 16.286, df = 4,p=\n.003) . A post-hoc sign test with Bonferroni correction only\nyielded signiÔ¨Åcance for the pair CR vs. Capella-Scan ( Z=\n‚àí3.166,p < . 005). The sign test on all pairs of recogniz-\ners yielded signiÔ¨Åcant results for CR vs. Photoscore ( Z=\n‚àí1.960,p=.049), CR vs. Capella ( Z=‚àí3.166,p=\n.001), and Capella-Scan vs. Sharpeye ( Z=‚àí2.261,p=\n.023), while the remaining pairwise comparisons were non-\nsigniÔ¨Åcant.\nThe results suggest that Capella-Scan often made more\nerrors than the remaining tools, and that Sharpeye often made\nfewer errors. The sign test also revealed that none of the\nrecognizers consistently outperform each other, for exam-\nple in the 46 scores that both recognizers were able to scan,\nCapella-Scan had fewer errors than Sharpeye in 14, 2 ties,\nand more errors in 30.\nWhile the average rankings of the tools suggest that the\n409Poster Session 3\ncombined recognizer generally performs better, the fact that\nwe can only give reasonable statistical evidence for this sup-\nposition for two of the commercial tools tempers the conclu-\nsion somewhat. We have little doubt that given a test corpus\nof scores in the hundreds we would obtain signiÔ¨Åcant differ-\nences for the remaining tools, but clearly the improvement is\nsmall. Even for high-quality (4 and 5) scores, all recognizers\nhad error counts above 0(only on a single score in Corpus\nB did every tool perform spotlessly). It appears that fully-\nautomated, error-free music recognition is not possible and\nthat human post-correction is almost invariably warranted.\n5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe have shown that a simple OMR system based on multi-\nple recognizers and sequence alignment can outperform the\ncommercially available tools. Our results conÔ¨Årm the ear-\nlier work of Byrd et al. suggesting that recognizers may be\nimproved somewhat by sequence alignment and voting, but\nthat more elaborate methods may be needed to obtain sub-\nstantial improvements. For future work, we suggest tack-\nling dynamics, slurs, articulations, ornaments, arpeggiated\nchords, and other embellishments. We advocate the estab-\nlishment of sizable online repositories of scores both for\nbenchmarking multiple recognizers and for the output of\nsuch systems (i.e., reliable, error-free scores), using a suit-\nable interchange format, e.g. [10].\n6.

WHY CHORDS?\nEver since Alexander Sheh and Dan Ellis‚Äôs Ô¨Årst foray into rec-\nognizing musical chords directly from audio [11], this chal-\nlenging problem has fascinated researchers at ISMIR. From\nthe beginning, however, the challenges have been more than\njust engineering: there has not been nearly enough labelled,\ntime-aligned data to train reliable recognizers. Sheh and Ellis\nworked with just twenty songs. Gradually, more data has be-\ncome available, most famously Christopher Harte‚Äôs transcrip-\ntions of the entire output of the Beatles [8], but even the most\nrecent Music Information Retrieval Evaluation Exchange\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\n¬©2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.(MIREX) contests1have had only 210 songs available [10].\nSome researchers have tried to circumvent the problem by\nsynthesizing audio from MIDI [9], but there has remained a\nsigniÔ¨Åcant interest in developing a larger, human-annotated\ndata set of chords from commercial recordings.\nAudio chord recognition is not the only use for a larger\ndata set. The analysis of harmony in popular music has been\ndrawing more and more attention from music theorists [2, 6].\nDue to the limitations on the amount of available data, these\nanalyses and theories are usually based on a very limited\nnumber of examples and cannot be generalized with statisti-\ncal guarantees of accuracy. A large-scale empirical analysis\nof harmony in popular music would be an enormous contri-\nbution to musicology, but such analysis would require not\nonly more data, just as audio chord recognition does, but also\na wider range of data. Of the 210 songs in the MIREX data\nset, 174 (83 percent) are by the Beatles. While that may be\nadmirable in terms of musical quality, it makes it impossi-\nble to draw more general conclusions about how harmony\noperated in the music of other artists and other periods. We\nbelieve that a single, well-conceived data set can address the\nneeds of both communities.\nWe are pleased to announce the release of a new data set\nthat comprises detailed transcriptions of the chords in more\nthan one thousand songs selected at random from Billboard\nmagazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù charts. Each transcription represents\nthe combined opinion of three or more experts in jazz and\npopular music, and the chord symbols have been time-aligned\nwith the musical meter and with commercially available au-\ndio recordings. This paper describes the methodology for\nselecting songs (section 2), explains the process used to tran-\nscribe them (section 3), and presents some basic descriptive\nstatistics to help readers understand how they might use these\ndata (section 4). In addition to the contribution of the data set,\nwe hope that information about how we produced them‚Äîa\nprocess that was considerably more involved than we had\noriginally expected‚Äîwill beneÔ¨Åt other research groups who\nare interested in transcribing still more chords themselves.\n1http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/\n633Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\n2. THE BILLBOARD ‚ÄúHOT 100‚Äù\nThe Billboard ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù is a weekly compilation of the\nmost popular music singles in the United States, all genres\nincluded, based on a combination of radio airplay and retail\nsales (and more recently, digital downloads).2The ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù\nhas been published continuously in Billboard magazine since\n4 August 1958, replacing earlier charts like ‚ÄúBest Sellers\nin Stores,‚Äù ‚ÄúMost Played by Jockeys,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMost Played in\nJukeboxes.‚Äù Although it is far from a perfect representation of\npopularity, like any ranking, it is generally regarded to be the\ngold standard among charts of popular music in North Amer-\nica [4]. Because it includes all genres, it seemed particularly\nwell-suited to the goals of training broadly-applicable chord\nrecognizers and drawing broadly-applicable musicological\nconclusions. It has also been the basis for several previous\nattempts to draw statistical conclusions about the behavior\nof popular singles over time [1, 4, 7].\n2.1 Sampling Methodology\nThe date of the Ô¨Årst chart, 4 August 1958, is a natural starting\ndate for selecting songs, but choosing an end date is less\nstraightforward. Hip-hop music does not lend itself readily to\nharmonic analysis as traditionally understood, and because\nhip-hop became more popular in the 1990s and 2000s, a\nlarger portion of the music on the ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù chart from these\nperiods falls out of the scope of the data set. Furthermore,\nthere have been several changes to the formula for computing\nthe ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù over time, including a particularly signiÔ¨Åcant\nshift in December 1991, when the data for generating the\ncharts shifted from being self-reported to being generated\nautomatically through Nielsen‚Äôs BDS and SoundScan sys-\ntem.3After this date, songs tended to stay on the charts for\nso much longer than before that Billboard established lim-\nits on how many weeks any given single would be allowed\nto remain on the ‚ÄúHot 100‚Äù chart, added a ‚ÄúRecurrent Sin-\ngles‚Äù chart to capture singles knocked o Ô¨Äthe chart due to the\nnew rule, and has averaged songs pre-1991 di Ô¨Äerently from\nthose post-1991 when generating historical summaries like\nthe ‚Äú50th-Anniversary‚Äù charts [3]. We chose to restrict our\nsample to charts prior to December 1991 in order to avoid\nthese problems.\nAs stated earlier, our goal in constructing this data set\nwas not only to provide a higher-quality set for audio chord\nrecognition but also to provide a data set that would be useful\nfor computational musicology and the analysis of popular\nmusic. As such, it was important to choose a sample of songs\nthat would allow for general questions about how popular\nmusic and the factors that made it popular evolved through-\nout the latter half of the twentieth century. Like most projects,\n2http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100\n3http://nielsen.com/us/en/industries/\nmedia-entertainment.html1. Divide the set of all chart slots into three eras:\n(a) 4 August 1958 to 31 December 1969,\n(b) 1 January 1970 to 31 December 1979, and\n(c) 1 January 1980 to 30 November 1991.\n2.Subdivide the chart slots in each era into Ô¨Åve sub-\ngroups corresponding to quintiles on the chart:\n(a) ranks 1 to 20,\n(b) ranks 21 to 40,\n(c) ranks 41 to 60,\n(d) ranks 61 to 80, and\n(e) ranks 81 to 100.\n3.Select a Ô¨Åxed percentage pof possible chart slots\nat random from each era-quintile pair.\n4. For each selected chart slot:\n(a)attempt to acquire the single at the target slot;\n(b)if that fails, toss a virtual coin to choose be-\ntween either the single directly above or di-\nrectly below the target slot on the chart from\nthe same week;\n(c)if that fails, choose the single that was not se-\nlected by the coin toss in 4b;\n(d)if that fails, toss a virtual coin to choose be-\ntween either the single two ranks above or two\nranks below the target single on the chart from\nthe same week;\n(e)if that fails, choose the single that was not se-\nlected by the coin Ô¨Çip in 4d; and\n(f)if that fails, consider the chart position to be a\nmissing data point.\nFigure 1 . Sampling algorithm for the Billboard ‚ÄúHot 100.‚Äù\nThe algorithm is designed to minimize the distortion from\n‚Äúconvenience sampling‚Äù while reducing the expense of col-\nlecting an audio collection. We believe that this algorithm\nyields a data set that, as cost-e Ô¨Äectively as possible, is\nvalid for drawing conclusions about relative positioning and\nchanges in the behavior of music on the charts over time.\n63412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n020406080100050100150\nHighest rank on any chartNumber of instancesFigure 2 . Histogram of the highest rank achieved on any\nchart among singles in the random sample. Because of the\nbehavior of popular songs‚Äînamely that they tend to stay on\nthe chart for a long time and rise and fall through di Ô¨Äerent\nranks‚Äîour sampling method still weighs the most popular\nsongs more heavily. We consider this behavior desirable.\nhowever, the budget was limited, and we wanted to make the\nbest use possible of the recordings we already had available\nwithout unduly biasing the Ô¨Ånal data set. In consultation with\na professional statistician, we devised the sampling method-\nology detailed in Ô¨Ågure 1. The Ô¨Årst two steps guarantee that\neven the most unfavorable random draw would still provide\nsome information about time and chart position. The Ô¨Ånal\nstep balances the desire to maximize use of recordings on\nhand with the need to achieve a sample that is representative\nof the underlying charts; it works on the assumption that\nsingles within two chart positions of each other in any given\nweek should behave similarly. In limit of an inÔ¨Ånite number\nof samples drawn in this way, one would expect to retrieve\nall recordings on hand weighted proportionally to their be-\nhavior on the charts. The more recordings of ‚Äúmissing‚Äù chart\npositions that one acquires later, the more accurately the Ô¨Ånal\nsample will represent the underlying charts.\n2.2 Properties of the Sample\nOverall, from a sample of 2000 slots, we were able to acquire\naudio for 1365 slots (68 percent): 424 of 683 from before\nthe 1970s, 505 of 664 from the 1970s, and 436 of 653 from\nafter the 1970s. Because the sample was taken over slots\nand not individual singles, some singles, especially popu-\nlar singles, appear more than once (and would need to be\nweighted accordingly for the most accurate statistics). Of the\n1100 unique singles in our sample, performed by 533 unique\nartists, the great majority of singles (869) do appear only\nonce, but 202 appear twice, 24 three times, and 5 four times.\nA more interesting artifact of sampling over slots instead of\nsingles is that even though the original sample was drawn\nevenly across all chart ranks, there is still more weight in the\nsample toward the most popular songs. Songs tend to remain# Love Will Keep Us Together\n# Captain and Tenille\n# 4/4\n# key: B\n| B | B | B | B |\n| B | B | D#:hdim7/b5 | D#:hdim7/b5 | G#:7 | G#:7 |\n| E | E | E:min | E:min |\n| B | B:aug | B:maj6 | B:7 |\n| E E/7 | C#:min7 F#:9(*3,11) . . |\n| B | B | B | B |\n| B | B | D#:hdim7/b5 | D#:hdim7/b5 | G#:7 | G#:7 |\nFigure 3 .

Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of peak ranks in\nour sample, which corresponds well to that of the full set of\nchart slots during the time period spanned in the sample.\n3. THE TRANSCRIPTION PROCESS\nAnnotating such a large data set was a considerably greater\nundertaking than we had expected, ultimately involving a\nteam of more than two dozen people. We began by devel-\noping a Ô¨Åle format for transcriptions that would capture as\nmuch musicologically-relevant information as possible, de-\nsigned a web site to manage transcriptions, and organized a\nseries of auditions to identify musicians with su Ô¨Écient skill\nto transcribe reliably and e Ô¨Éciently at a high level of detail.\n3.1 The Transcription Format\nThe transcription format was a plain-text format in order to\nfacilitate transfer across platforms. The full speciÔ¨Åcation is\navailable for download with the transcriptions themselves,\nbut the basic premises are illustrated in Ô¨Ågure 3. All non-\nmusical material is preceded by a comment character ( #), and\ncomments are allowed at the end of any line. The annotators\nused them freely. Each transcription begins with a four-line\nheader containing the title of the song, the name of the artist,\nthe meter, and the key, and new meter and key lines are added\nas necessary to reÔ¨Çect changes throughout the song. Each\ntranscription is broken with line breaks into phrases, which\nare deÔ¨Åned loosely as any point where a group might choose\nto start playing during a rehearsal. Pipes ( |) denote barlines,\nand although transcribers were allowed to mark chords using\nwhatever notation came most naturally to them, all have since\nbeen converted to the format proposed in [8].\n635Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nFigure 4 . Screenshot of the web site that annotators used\nto manage their work. The page contains a list of all assign-\nments as well as information about to whom each single was\nassigned and when.\nChords are marked for every beat, with some shorthand\nto improve readability. For quadruple meters, which are the\nmost common, a bar with a single chord symbol is assumed to\nhave the same chord for all four beats. Bars with two symbols\nare assumed to have the chord change on beat 3. For bars\nwith less than four chords that follow other patterns, periods\nare used to denote chords that have not changed. For example,\nin the Ô¨Årst bar of the Ô¨Åfth line of the transcription in Ô¨Ågure\n3 contains E on the Ô¨Årst two beat and E /D/sharpon the second\ntwo beats, whereas the second bar contains C /sharpmin7 on the\nÔ¨Årst beat only followed by what might be noted as F /sharp11 in\na fake book on the last three beats. Chord changes that are\nfaster than the beat level are simpliÔ¨Åed. Notable silences in\nthe music are marked with the special tag &pause .\n3.2 Auditions and the Transcription Process\nOver several recruitment periods between April and Decem-\nber 2010, 30 musicians were invited to audition for the project.\nWith one exception (an undergraduate), these musicians were\neither graduate students in music performance or professional\njazz performers (often both). Of those invited to audition, 23\ncompleted the audition and 17 were ultimately hired. We\nprepared a detailed description of the Ô¨Åle format for those\nauditioning, as well as a set of six sample songs with full\ntranscriptions, in order to help the potential transcribers un-\nderstand the format and the level of detail expected. After\nstudying these materials, all those auditioning transcribed a\nset of Ô¨Åve test songs that were chosen to be representative of\nthe more di Ô¨Écult songs one would encounter. We reviewed\nthese test transcriptions, decided whether the annotator had\nsuÔ¨Écient potential to continue, and provided detailed feed-\nback on the audition to each transcriber we hired in order to\nensure as much consistency as possible across transcriptions.\nAfter hiring, following the principle of double-keying to\nminimize mistakes, two annotators were assigned to each\n020406080Minutes to transcribeFigure 5 . Transcribing times for each annotator. Box widths\nare scaled proportional to the square root of the number of\ntranscriptions completed.

The majority of\nsongs took between 8 and 18 minutes to transcribe, although\na few extremely di Ô¨Écult songs took more than an hour.\nsong. Working with a custom-designed web interface (see\nÔ¨Ågure 4), the annotators were able to access the audio for\ntheir assignments and, although they were asked to work in-\ndependently, to see who their partner annotator was in case of\nany di Ô¨Écult questions. Annotators worked at di Ô¨Äerent speeds,\nand in order to reward more e Ô¨Écient annotators, we paid per\nsong with a bonus system to compensate for songs that were\nunusually di Ô¨Écult to transcribe. The majority of songs were\ntranscribed in 8 to 18 minutes (median 12 minutes), but the\nmost di Ô¨Écult songs could take an hour or more (see Ô¨Ågure 5).\nMost annotators also reported that regardless of the amount\nof time spent, it was di Ô¨Écult to do more than a dozen songs\nin a single day: due to the intense concentration necessary, it\nwas simply too exhausting for them to work more.\nAfter the two assigned annotators for any given song had\ncompleted their transcriptions, a third meta-annotator com-\npared the two versions‚Äîinevitably, there were usually dif-\nferences in notation or musical opinion in addition to actual\nerrors‚Äîand combined them into a master transcription. This\ncombined version was then time-aligned and annotated with\nstructural information based on musical similarity, functional\ninformation (verse, chorus, etc.), and instrumentation [12].\nFactoring in the salaries of all involved, it cost more than $20\nper song to arrive at this Ô¨Ånal Ô¨Åle, but we believe that the\nrichness and accuracy of the data justify the cost.\n4. THE DATA SET\nThere are 414 059 labeled beats in our corpus, spread over\n638 distinct chords and 99 chord classes. Each song contains\n11.8 unique chords on average, ranging from a minimum of\n1 to a maximum of 84; songs from the late 1970s exhibit the\nmost harmonic variety.

The most noticeable pattern is a sharp fallo Ô¨Ä\nafter the seven most popular chords (all major): C, D, G, A,\nE, F, and B /flat. Indeed, a milder fallo Ô¨Äbegins even after the\nfour most popular chords. Certainly these chords are a use-\nful set‚Äîthey are su Ô¨Écient to play in the Ô¨Åve most common\nmajor keys‚Äîbut such a sharp decline even for minor chords\nwas unexpected. For chord classes, the fallo Ô¨Äis even more\nextreme, although this is to be expected. The dominance of\nmajor and minor chords and simple seventh chords is con-\nsistent with most approaches to simplifying chords symbols\n(see [10], among others). The ordering suggests that with a\ndata set of this size, it might be reasonable to start training\nsystems that can also recognize simple 9th and 11th chords.\nTo our knowledge, there is no other curated corpus of\npopular harmony that equals this new data set in terms of\nsize or scope. It is roughly Ô¨Åve times the size of the existing\nMIREX set and contains a considerably broader range of\nartists, genres, and time periods. Trevor de Clercq and David\nTemperley have annotated another impressive data set of\n200 songs from Rolling Stone ‚Äôs ‚Äú500 Greatest Songs of All\nTime,‚Äù but their set is not time-aligned with audio [5]. We\nare currently working on a corpus analysis to compare our\nset to theirs and to explore deeper structures that may be\ndiscoverable with a larger data set.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nSeeking to beneÔ¨Åt both researchers interested in audio chord\nrecognition and researchers interested in computational ap-\nproaches to studying harmony in popular music, we have\ncreated a database more than four times the size of any exist-\ning database with detailed, curated musicological information\nand time-alignment with commercial audio recordings. The\ndata set beneÔ¨Åts from a special sampling methodology that\nwas designed to maximize its utility both for musicological\nand for engineering purposes. Other researchers who wish to\nextend this data set or build a similar one of their own should\nbe warned that the process is labor-intensive, but the statis-\ntics in this paper should provide guidelines for planning and\nbudgeting. We are very excited to start working on the many\nquestions this database will allow researchers to answer, and\nwe are proud to make it available to the community at no\ncost and with minimally restrictive licensing.4\n6.

Assuch,a lot ofworkisdevotedto un-\nderstandinghowvariousmusicfeaturesandmusicstructure\nplay a role in inducingemotion. A detailed review of these\nworkscanbefoundin[4,8,11].\nThe work of Livingstone, et al. [11] also demonstrates\nthat by changing speciÔ¨Åc music elements, the emotion per-\nceived by the listener also changes. A similar research is\nalso done in [14] but instead of relyingon verbal reportsof\nfeelings, emotion data is derived from analyzing change in\nactivityinthe autonomicnervoussystem.\nAnother approach to identifying emotion is using psy-\nchophysiological data. Researchers observed that changes\nin musical features lead to a change in physchophysiologi-\ncalresponse. Forexample,changeintempoleadtochanges\ninrespirationrate[3,7].

TIME SERIES MOTIFS\nForclarity,Ô¨ÅrstwedeÔ¨Åneconceptsandterminologyneeded\nto understand our work. These deÔ¨Ånitions are taken from\n[2].

It is possible to Ô¨Ånd many\nmotifs in one time series, the most signiÔ¨Åcant of these is\nreferred to as 1-motif. To ensure that the 1-motifdoes not\nshare elementswith othermotifs, a range Ris deÔ¨Ånedsuch\nthatD(Ci,Ck)>2R,forall1‚â§i < k.\n3.

We consider an-\nalyzing data from : blood volume pulse (BVP), respiration\n(RR), andskin conductance(SC).

MOTIF DISCOVERY\nThe process of motif discovery is illustrated in Figure 2.\nThis algorithm is adapted from the work in [2] where they\nusedaprojectionalgorithmbyBuhlerandTompa[15]. The\nFigure2.

Physiological signals that keep on recur -\nringwouldindicatethatmusicpassagesheardatthesepoint s\nare interesting to the listener (i.e., it makes him relaxed, or\nheenjoysthemusicsegment).\nThe motif discovery algorithm can be separated into 3\nmainparts: datapreparation,conversionofthe datatosym-\nbolic form using the Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation\n(SAX) representation, and motif discovery using the pro-\njection algorithm. Each part is described in the following\nsubsections.\n4.1 Datapreparation\nPrior to motif discovery, the physiological data undergoes\noffset and amplitude scaling transformations using (1) and\n(2), respectively[1,6,17,18].\nQoffset=Q‚àí/summationtextn\ni=1qi\nn, (1)\nwhereQis deÔ¨Åned as a time series with nlength and\nQoffsetisthe timeseriesafteroffsettransformation.\nQscaled=Qoffset\nœÉ, (2)\nwhereœÉis the standarddeviationof the data and Qscaledis\nthetime seriesafteramplitudescalingtransformation.\nInordertoreducefurtherproblemswhencomparingdif-\nferentsubsequences,alldataisnormalizedtotherange[0, 1]\nusing(3).\nQ=Q‚àímin(Q)\nmax(Q)‚àímin(Q)(3)\n4.2 SAX representation\nThe Symbolic Aggregate ApproXimation (SAX) represen-\ntationisusedtoconvertanytimeseriesintoastringofsym-\nbols. By using SAX, powerful algorithms on string pat-\ntern analysis developed in other Ô¨Åelds can be used.

We report and discuss results im-\nportant for mobile applications: Receiver Operating Char-\nacteristic (ROC) performance, size of Ô¨Ångerprints generated\ncompared to size of audio probe, and transmission delay if\nthe Ô¨Ångerprint data were to be transmitted over a wireless\nlink. We hope that the evaluation in this work will guide\nwork towards reducing latency in practical mobile audio re-\ntrieval applications.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nAudio Ô¨Ångerprinting provides the ability to derive a com-\npact representation which can be efÔ¨Åciently matched against\nother audio clips. With smart phones becoming ubiquitous,\nthere are several applications of audio Ô¨Ångerprinting on mo-\nbile devices. A common use case is query-by-example mu-\nsic recognition: a user listens to a song in a restaurant, shop-\nping mall, or in a car, and wants to know more information\nabout the song. Shazam [1] and SoundHound [2] are ex-\namples of popular music recognition applications on cell-\nphones. Other applications of audio Ô¨Ångerprinting on mo-\nbile devices include copyright detection [4], personalized\nentertainment and interactive television without extraneous\nhardware [8].\nMobile query-by-example applications pose a unique set\nof challenges. First, the application has to be low-latency\nto provide users with an interactive experience. To achieve\nlow latency, the retrieval framework has to adapt to stringent\nmemory, computational, power and bandwidth requirements\nof the mobile client. It is important that the size of the data\ngenerated needs to be as small as possible to reduce network\nlatency, which is typically the bottleneck in 3G networks.\nSecond, the length of the audio required to get a match\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc‚Éù2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.should be short for mobile applications (e.g., <10 seconds).\nCurrent applications Shazam [1] and SoundHound [2] often\nrequire >10 seconds for retrieval. For copyright detection,\none might use 30-60 second probes for retrieval [4], which\nis not feasible for interactive mobile applications. Third, the\ndistortions introduced by cell phones tend to be more severe\nthan simple degradations like compression artifacts, time-\noffsets, amplitude compression or structured noise present\nin near-duplicate detection problems [4]. On mobile de-\nvices, we need to be mindful of ambient noise present in\nshopping malls or cafes, errors in sampling through tele-\nphony equipment, low bit-rate voice compression and other\nquality-enhancement algorithms that might be built into the\nmobile device or introduced by the carrier network. In this\nwork, we evaluate the state-of-the-art in content-based au-\ndio retrieval with focus on query-by-example mobile appli-\ncations.\n2. PRIOR WORK AND MOTIVATION\nState-of-the-art audio retrieval applications use a set of low\nlevel Ô¨Ångerprints extracted from the audio sample for re-\ntrieval. The Ô¨Ångerprints are typically computed on the spec-\ntrogram - a time frequency representation of the audio. Hait-\nsma et al. [11] propose Ô¨Ångerprints based on Bark Frequency\nCepstrum CoefÔ¨Åcients (BFCC). Highly overlapping frames\nare considered to ensure that the query probe can be detected\nat arbitrary time-alignment. Each Ô¨Ångerprint is 32 bits and\ncan be compared efÔ¨Åciently with Hamming distances. Ke\net al. [14] improve the performance of the Ô¨Ångerprinting\nscheme in [11] using the AdaBoost technique from com-\nputer vision. Baluja et al. [4] propose a scheme based on\nwavelets. The overlapping spectrogram images are trans-\nformed into a sparse wavelet representation and the pop-\nular min-hash technique [5] is used to obtain a 100 byte\nÔ¨Ångerprint which can be compared directly with byte-wise\nHamming distances. In contrast to the three schemes above,\nWang [17,18] proposes looking only at spectrogram peaks.\nThe authors are not aware of a comprehensive evaluation\nof the different Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes in a common frame-\nwork. In contrast, several such evaluations exist for im-\nage features in the computer vision community for content-\nbased image retrieval [15, 19]. Fingerprints developed for\n801Oral Session 10\napplications like query-by-humming and cover song detec-\ntion are outside the scope of this paper. In particular, we\nare interested in factors affecting practical query-by-exact-\nexample mobile applications. The questions that are most\ncritical for mobile applications are:\n‚Ä¢How much Ô¨Ångerprint data does each scheme generate?\n‚Ä¢How does the size of the Ô¨Ångerprint data compare to\nthe size of the compressed audio needed for accurate re-\ntrieval?\n‚Ä¢What would the transmission delay be if the Ô¨Ångerprints\nwere transmitted over a typical 3G network?\n‚Ä¢How discriminative are the different Ô¨Ångerprinting sche-\nmes?\n‚Ä¢How do the different schemes perform for really short( ‚àº5\nseconds) and noisy query probes captured by cell phones\n?\n‚Ä¢How does the performance of each scheme vary as a\nfunction of probe length in the range of 5 to 15 seconds\ntypical for mobile applications?\n3. CONTRIBUTIONS\nWe survey and evaluate popular audio Ô¨Ångerprinting sche-\nmes in a common framework with short noisy query audio\nprobes captured from cell phones. We report and discuss re-\nsults important for mobile applications: Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) performance, size of Ô¨Ångerprints gen-\nerated compared to size of audio probe, and transmission\ndelay if the Ô¨Ångerprint data were to be transmitted over a\nwireless link. We hope that the evaluation in this paper will\nprovide key insights and guide us towards developing low\nlatency retrieval systems. In Section 4, we survey the differ-\nent audio Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes. In Section 5, we describe\nthe evaluation framework and provide experimental results.\n4. SURVEY OF FINGERPRINTING SCHEMES\nBefore we survey popular audio Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes, we\ndiscuss the typical pipeline for audio retrieval applications.\nFirst, a set of Ô¨Ångerprints are extracted from the query song.\nThe Ô¨Ångerprints could be extracted at uniform sampling rate,\nor only around points of interest in the spectrogram (e.g.,\nspectrogram peaks in the case of Wang [18]). For mobile\napplications, it is critical that individual Ô¨Ångerprints be ro-\nbust against ambient noise, compared to the corresponding\ndatabase Ô¨Ångerprint.\nNext the query is compared with a database of reference\ntracks to Ô¨Ånd candidate matches. To avoid pairwise com-\nparison between the query and all of the reference tracks,\nthe database is partitioned. The partitioning of the database\nis precomputed for the database, and each partition is asso-\nciated with a list of database songs (also called an inverted\nindex). The partitioning on the database could be done bydirect hashing of the Ô¨Ångerprints (e.g., a 32 bit Ô¨Ångerprint\ncould be directly hashed into a table with 4 billion entries),\nLocality Sensitive Hashing or techniques based on Vector\nQuantization. This partitioning allows approximate-nearest-\nneighbor-search as exact-nearest-neighbor search is infeasi-\nble in a database with billions of Ô¨Ångerprints. The inverted\nÔ¨Åle for each cell consists of a list of song IDs and the timing\noffsets at which the Ô¨Ångerprints appear. The timing infor-\nmation is used in the Ô¨Ånal step of the pipeline. Based on the\nnumber of Ô¨Ångerprints they have in common with the query\nprobe from the inverted index, a short list of potentially sim-\nilar database songs is selected from the database.\nFinally, a temporal alignment step is applied to the most\nsimilar matches in the database. Techniques like Expecta-\ntion Maximization [14], RANSAC [9], or Dynamic Time\nWarping [6] are used for temporal alignment. In the case of\nlinear correspondence (i.e., the tempo of the database and\nquery songs are the same), Wang [18] proposes using a sim-\nple and fast technique that looks for a diagonal in the time-\nvs-time plot for matching database and query Ô¨Ångerprints.\nThe existence of a strong diagonal indicates a valid match.\nThe temporal alignment step is used to get rid of false posi-\ntives, and enables very high precision retrieval.\nIn this Section, we review three Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes in\ndetail: Ke [14], Baluja [4] and Wang [18]. In the interest of\nspace, we omit the scheme proposed by Haitsma [11] as the\nÔ¨Ångerprint by Ke improves directly upon their scheme [14].\nFor a comparison of the two schemes by Ke and Haitsma,\ninterested readers are referred to [14]. For each scheme, we\nÔ¨Årst discuss the details of the scheme and the motivation\nbehind the approach, followed by system parameters sug-\ngested by the authors that provide good trade-off between\naccuracy and computational complexity.\n4.1 Ke, Hoiem and Sukthankar\n4.1.1 Description\nKe‚Äôs approach builds on popular classiÔ¨Åcation techniques in\nthe computer vision community. Ke provides the important\ninsight that 1-D audio signals can be processed as conven-\ntional images when viewed in the time-frequency spectro-\ngram representation. The time-frequency spectrogram data\nis treated as a set of overlapping images. To compute a com-\npact Ô¨Ångerprint on each image, the authors Ô¨Årst train simple\nAdaBoost classiÔ¨Åers based on box-Ô¨Ålters, a technique pop-\nular in face detection. The training data for classiÔ¨Åcation\nis obtained by considering audio samples and their corre-\nsponding versions degraded by noise. The output of each\nclassiÔ¨Åer yields a binary value. E.g., each classiÔ¨Åer outputs\na 1 or a 0 based on the differences between values aggre-\ngated in two sub-rectangular regions of the spectrogram im-\nage. The concatenated output of the set of classiÔ¨Åers is then\nused as a Ô¨Ångerprint of the spectrogram image.\n80212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4.1.2 System Parameters\nKe and Haitsma use the same set of parameters for comput-\ning the spectrogram. The spectrogram, obtained by Short\nTerm Fourier Transform (STFT), represents the power in\n33 logarithmically-spaced frequency bands spaced 300 Hz\nand 2000 Hz. Overlapping spectrogram images measured\nover 0.372s windows are considered in 11.6 ms increments\n(‚àº100 Ô¨Ångerprints/second). The short increments coupled\nwith large spectrogram images at each step are used to make\nthe scheme robust to sampling errors and small time-offsets.\nFor a 10 second probe, the scheme produces 860 Ô¨Ånger-\nprints. For the AdaBoosting step, 32 classiÔ¨Åers are chosen\nout of a candidate list of 25000 Ô¨Ålters. We use the training\ndata sets and code provided by the authors at [13]. Two Ô¨Ån-\ngerprints are considered to be a match if they have a Ham-\nming distance <2, in the feature matching step of the re-\ntrieval pipeline.\n4.2 Baluja and Covell\n4.2.1 Description\nSimilar to Ke‚Äôs work, Baluja‚Äôs Ô¨Ångerprint is also inspired\nfrom the image retrieval community. The pipeline for com-\nputing ‚Äúwaveprints‚Äù(the term used by the authors to describe\ntheir wavelet-based Ô¨Ångerprints) is illustrated in Fig. 1, and\nin inspired from [12].\nFirst, the authors compute overlapping spectrogram im-\nages using the same approach proposed by Ke. Next, the\nspectrogram images are decomposed using multi-resolution\nHaar wavelets. Wavelets are chosen due to their effective-\nness in the retrieval work presented in [12]. An image pro-\nduces as many wavelet co-efÔ¨Åcients as pixels. Next, the au-\nthors retain only the top- tfew wavelets, where tis chosen\nto be much smaller than the size of the spectrogram im-\nage. Next, the authors observe that the top- twavelets are\nsparse. To obtain a compact represenation, the authors only\nretain the sign information (an approach also found effective\nin [12]), and use the Min-Hash technique to generate a set\nofpbytes that is used to represent the original spectrogram\nimage. Two spectrogram images can now be compared di-\nrectly by computing the byte-wise Hamming distance of the\npbytes. For this approach to be effective, pneeds to be\nlarge (typically chosen to be 100). Nearest neighbor search-\ning in a 100 dimensional space is non-trivial. Hence, in the\nÔ¨Ånal step, Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is used to Ô¨Ånd\napproximate-nearest-neighbor Ô¨Ångerprints in this space.\n4.2.2 System Parameters\nThe authors optimize system parameters for accuracy and\ncomputational complexity in [3, 4]. We use the parame-\nters recommended by the authors in [3]. Overlapping spec-\ntrogram images measured over 0.372 second windows are\nconsidered in 0.09 second strides ( ‚àº10 Ô¨Ångerprints/second).\nt= 200 top wavelets are considered. pis chosen to be\nFigure 1 .Pipeline for extracting waveprint features proposed by\nBaluja [4]. Spectrogram images are represented as pbytes obtained from\nMin-Hashing, which can be compared byte-wise directly for computing\nsimilarity.\n100, i.e., each Ô¨Ångerprint is represented as 100 bytes. For\nLSH, the 100-byte Ô¨Ångerprint is divided into 25 equal 4-byte\nbands. Each 4-byte band is stored as a 32 bit hash table. In\nthe feature-matching step, two Ô¨Ångerprints are considered to\nbe a match if their 4-byte representations match in at least\none of the 25 LSH bands.\nFigure 2 .Illustration of audio Ô¨Ångerprints proposed by Wang [17].\nTriplet information ( (t2‚àít1, f1,(f2‚àíf1))is quantized to form the Ô¨Ån-\ngerprint.)\n4.3 Wang\n4.3.1 Description\nWhile the schemes by Ke and Baluja use dense sampling\nand compute Ô¨Ångerprints over fairly large spectrogram im-\nages, Wang proposes looking only at spectrogram peaks.\nThere are two reasons for choosing spectrogram peaks: First,\nspectrogram peaks are more likely to survive ambient noise.\nSecond, spectrogram peaks satisfy the property of linear su-\nperposition, i.e., a spectrogram peak analysis of music and\nnoise together will contain spectral peaks due to the music\nand the noise as if they were analyzed separately [17]. The\nÔ¨Ångerprinting scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. For pairs of\npeaks (t1, f1)and(t2, f2), the Ô¨Ångerprint is computed on\na triplet of ((t2‚àít1), f1,(f2‚àíf1)). Each number in the\ntriplet is quantized and the concatenated value is treated as\nthe Ô¨Ångerprint.\n4.3.2 System Parameters\nFor this scheme, we adapt the implementation provided by\nEllis [7]. We optimize over a parametric space, and choose\nthe following set of parameters. The frequency data in the\nspectrogram is divided into 256 levels linearly. We con-\nsider neighboring peaks in an adjacent frequency range of\n64 units, and timing range of 64 units (sampling rate of the\naudio signal is set to 8 KHz). The values ((t2‚àít1), f1,(f2‚àí\n803Oral Session 10\nf1))are represented as 6,8 and 6 bits respectively to ob-\ntain a 20 bit Ô¨Ångerprint. For this data set, the 20 bit Ô¨Ån-\ngerprint works better than a 32-bit Ô¨Ångerprint suggested by\nWang in [18] - note that over quantization could affect per-\nformance adversely. We generate 20 Ô¨Ångerprints per second.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWe use our own data set as we were not able to Ô¨Ånd any\npublicly available data sets captured from mobile phones.\nMost existing data sets introduce artiÔ¨Åcial distortions to the\naudio (e.g., adding noise), and are not representative of dis-\ntortions typical in the mobile scenario. We captured audio\nclips on a Nexus One phone from a set of 39 songs played\non TV and from laptop speakers in noisy environments. In\nour data collection, we tried to capture noise from differ-\nent ambient noise sources. Our song data set contains pop-\nular songs from artists like Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson,\nGreen Day, Avril Lavigne, to name a few. Each of these\nclips is between 60 and 90 seconds long, which we divide\ninto non-overlapping 5, 10 and 15 second snippets to use\nas query probes. This gives us a ground truth data set of\nover a 1000 pairs of query probes and their corresponding\nuncorrupted reference songs. All pairs between query and\nreference, both positive and negative examples, are consid-\nered to generate Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)\ncurves.\n5.1 Receiver Operating Characteristic\nWe evaluate the different Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes Ô¨Årst after\nthe Ô¨Ångerprint indexing step, and subsequently, the temporal\nalignment step.\n5.1.1 Fingerprint Indexing\nThe inverted index on the database enables fast retrieval and\nprovides a shortlist of candidates to be considered for a more\nextensive temporal alignment check. Each query Ô¨Ångerprint\nvotes for all the database Ô¨Ångerprints that it Ô¨Ånds in the in-\nverted index. The similarity between the database song and\nquery song is the number of Ô¨Ångerprints in common be-\ntween them, based on the approximate-nearest-neighbor in-\ndexing strategy. For Ke, the similarity measure is the num-\nber of Ô¨Ångerprints that have <2 Hamming distance. For\nBaluja, the similarity measure is the number of Ô¨Ångerprints\nthat have >=1 matches in the 25 LSH bands. For Wang, the\nsimilarity measure is the number of 20-bit Ô¨Ångerprints that\nget hashed to the same bin.\nWe compute such a similarity score for matching and\nnon-matching pairs of ground-truth query and database songs,\nfor the different schemes. From these similarity scores, we\nform two histograms, one for matching pairs and one for\nnon-matching pairs, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The overlap-\nping between the two histograms depends on the Ô¨Ångerprint-\ning scheme, and more importantly, the length of the queryprobe. The longer the query probe, the lower the overlap be-\ntween the two histograms, and the better the performance of\nthe scheme. Also, the more discriminative the Ô¨Ångerprint,\nthe lower the overlap between the two histograms. From\nthe two histograms we obtain a Receiver Operating Char-\nacteristic (ROC) curve which plots correct match fraction\nagainst incorrect match fraction. The different points on the\nROC curve are obtained by adjusting the similarity measure\nthreshold. The higher the ROC curve, the more effective the\nretrieval system.\n10‚àí410‚àí310‚àí210‚àí110000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91\nIncorrect match factionCorrect match factionROC Curve\n  \nWang et al.

The number in brack-\nets is the length of the query probe in seconds. The performance of each\nÔ¨Ångerprinting scheme increases as the query length increases. Baluja‚Äôs\nscheme performs the best.\nWe plot the ROC performance of the three schemes in\nFig. 4. For each scheme, we note that the ROC performance\nimproves as the length of the query probe increases from 5\nto 15 seconds, as expected. Typically, the returns are dimin-\nishing beyond 10 seconds. Baluja‚Äôs Ô¨Ångerprinting scheme\nperforms the best for all query probe lengths. The Min-\nHash based Ô¨Ångerprints (100 bytes each) are highly discrim-\ninative and capture information over a longer time-duration\nthan Wang‚Äôs scheme.\nThe Wang Ô¨Ångerprints are far more compact - however,\nthe Ô¨Ångerprints are sensitive to small offsets in spectrogram\npeak localization. The low dimensionality of the Ô¨Ånger-\nprint makes it less discriminative, causing the scheme to re-\nquire a longer probe to achieve a comparable performance to\nBaluja‚Äôs scheme. Also, the lower dimensionality of the de-\nscriptor implies that it does not scale well as the size of the\ndatabase grows. As the length of the query probe increases\nto 15 seconds, Wang‚Äôs scheme catches up in performance.\nFinally, we observe that Ke‚Äôs scheme performs poorly\nfor the short query probes that we are interested in. For\nKe‚Äôs scheme to catch up in ROC performance, much longer\nprobes would be required. The scheme also suffers due to\nits dependence on the set of AdaBoost classiÔ¨Åers used to\ngenerate the Ô¨Ångerprint. For our evaluation, we used the\nAdaBoost classiÔ¨Åers provided by the authors in [13].

Longer query probes\nprovide a better separation between the two distributions.\nmismatch between training and test data can affect the per-\nformance of this scheme adversely. We require robustness\nagainst a broad range of mobile environments and noise\nsources, and training a set of AdaBoost classiÔ¨Åers for dif-\nferent environments is not practical.\n5.1.2 Temporal Alignment\nBased on computational resources available, accuracy re-\nquirements and the size of the database, retrieval systems\nchoose an operating point on the curve shown in Fig. 4.\nE.g., state-of-the-art retrieval systems would typically op-\nerate in the 80-90% True Positive Rate regime. At the oper-\nating point, we apply the Temporal Alignment (TA) scheme\nproposed by Wang to get rid of false positives. It is rela-\ntively easy to achieve high precision for audio retrieval ap-\nplications. By requiring a minimum number of Ô¨Ångerprint\nmatches to satisfy TA, we can get rid of most false positives.\nWe set the minimum number of temporally aligned matches\nto 5 for this experiment. We plot the percentage of queries\npassing the temporal alignment check as a function of query\nprobe length in Fig. 5. Again, we observe Baluja‚Äôs scheme\nperforms the best, followed by Wang and Ke respectively.\nThe performance for each scheme improves as the length\nof the query probe increases. We conclude that highly dis-\ncriminative Ô¨Ångerprints help signiÔ¨Åcantly for short 5 second\nquery probes. Next, we study the amount of data generated\nfor each Ô¨Ångerprinting scheme.\n5 10 150.40.50.60.70.80.91\nQuery Probe Length(%) of query probes that pass TA\n  \nWang\nKe\nBaluja\nFigure 5 .Recall as a function of query probe length for different sc-\nhemes. Precision is 100% as the temporal alignment step eliminates false\npositives.5.2 Data Size and Transmission Delay\nThe different Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes generate different amo-\nunts of data. Here, we present results for a 10 second probe,\nas 10 second probes provide a balance between accuracy and\nlatency for all three schemes. Ke‚Äôs scheme produces 729\n4-byte Ô¨Ångerprints, Baluja‚Äôs scheme produces 87 100-byte\nÔ¨Ångerprints, and Wang‚Äôs scheme produces 587 20-bit Ô¨Ånger-\nprints on average for 10 second probes. The amount of data\ngenerated for the different schemes is shown in Fig. 7. We\ncompare the size of Ô¨Ångerprint data to the size of a 10 second\nVorbis compressed audio at 64 kbps (80 KB). We observe\nthat the size of Ô¨Ångerprint data is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than\nthe size of the compressed audio for all Ô¨Ångerprinting sche-\nmes ( <10 KB). This motivates computing the Ô¨Ångerprints\non the device, whenever possible. We note that Wang‚Äôs\nscheme produces less data than Baluja‚Äôs or Ke‚Äôs scheme.\nFor a fair comparison between the different schemes, we\nplot the bitrate-Equal Error Rate (EER) performance in Fig-\nure 6. We note that the reduction in data for Wang‚Äôs scheme\ncomes at the cost of ROC performance shown in Fig. 6.\nIf Ô¨Ångerprinting were to be done on the device, how long\nwould the transmission delay be for sending the Ô¨Ångerprint\ndata? The transmission delay would depend on the wireless\nnetwork used: 3G or WLAN (Wireless LAN). WLAN sys-\ntems provide much higher bandwidth compared to 3G, and\ntransmission delay is negligible even for large packet sizes.\nHere, we present transmission delay numbers only for a 3G\nconnection, as it is the most prevalent on mobile phones to-\nday [16]. For network transmission delay experiments, we\nuse the data presented in [10, 16]. The authors conduct ex-\nperiments in an AT&T 3G wireless network, with a total of\nmore than 5000 transmissions at locations where a typical\naudio retrieval system would be used.\nWe present the time it would take to transmit Ô¨Ångerprint\ndata for the different schemes in Fig. 7(b). Transmitting Ô¨Ån-\ngerprint data takes in the order of a few seconds, while trans-\nmitting the compressed audio could take tens of seconds,\nbased on the wireless link. Note that the delay numbers\nshown here only represent the data transmission delay for\n805Oral Session 10\n0 5 10 150510152025303540\nBitrate (KB)Equal Error Rate (EER) (%)\n  \nWang\nKe\nBalujaFigure 6 .Equal Error Rate (EER) vs. bitrate tradeoff.

The end-to-end system la-\ntency would depend on the streaming protocol, the length of\nquery probe considered, transmission delay and processing\ndelay on the server. Based on the experimental results pre-\nsented here and in [10], we would expect the transmission\ndelay to be the bottleneck in 3G networks, which motivates\ncomputing Ô¨Ångerprints on the device.\n01020304050607080Data Size (KB)\nWang Ke Baluja Audio\n(a)\n024681012141618Network Latency (s)\nWang Ke Baluja Audio (b)\nFigure 7 .Fig.(a) shows size of data generated by different schemes.\nFig.(b) shows the associated transmission delay if the data were to be trans-\nferred over a 3G network. The data and transmission delay numbers are\npresented for 10 second query probes. Data for 5 and 15 second probes can\nbe extrapolated linearly.\nFinally, we draw some parallels between mobile image\nretrieval and audio retrieval. We note that Ke and Baluja\nwere both inspired by work in computer vision literature.\nInterest point detectors and descriptors have been well stud-\nied in computer literature: readers are referred to the sur-\nvey papers [15, 19]. What has pushed the Ô¨Åeld forward is\nthe availability of good image and patch level data sets that\ncapture the distortions (e.g., perspective and lighting in im-\nages) that interest point detectors and descriptors need to\nbe robust against. The availability of similar ground-truth\ndata sets will be useful for designing interest point detectors\nand descriptors for audio retrieval. Spectrogram peaks pro-\nposed by Wang is one example of interest point detection,\nbut other schemes need to be explored. Interest point de-\ntectors are the Ô¨Årst step in the pipeline, and improvements\nhere could affect blocks further down the pipeline. Next,\nwe note that the best descriptors in the vision literature are\nhigh-dimensional and capture salient characteristics in a lo-\ncal neighborhood around the interest point. In the case of\naudio retrieval, we need descriptors around interest points tobe robust against small timing offset errors, and distortions\nintroduced by ambient noise. Both interest point detectors\nand descriptors for audio retrieval in highly noisy environ-\nments are interesting areas for future work. We conclude by\nnoting that techniques and algorithms developed in recent\nimage retrieval literature can be used to further improve ef-\nÔ¨Åciency and performance of audio retrieval systems.\n6. CONCLUSION\nWe perform a thorough survey and evaluation of popular\naudio Ô¨Ångerprinting schemes in a common framework. We\nreport and discuss results important for mobile applications:\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) performance, size\nof Ô¨Ångerprints generated compared to size of the compressed\naudio sample, transmission delay if the Ô¨Ångerprint data were\nto be transmitted over a 3G wireless link and computational\ncost of Ô¨Ångerprint generation.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nIdentifying music structural segmentation is one of the most\nimportant and difÔ¨Åcult problems in music information re-\ntrieval (MIR). Its goal is to automatically locate the musi-\ncally repetitive parts within a piece of music (e.g. verse,\nbridge and chorus in popular music). It has applications\nsuch as music thumbnail, segment-based editing and segment-\nbased navigation. It may also facilitate other MIR tasks like\nbeat tracking and chord detection.\nThere are some noteworthy existing systems, which in-\nspire our proposed model. Foote [1] proposed self-similarity\nmatrix for structure representation. Levy et al [2] proposed a\ntwo-level model for structural segmentation problem. In the\nThis work was performed while interning at Institute of Acoustics,\nChinese Academy of Sciences.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.lower level, they introduced Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\nto quantize audio feature vectors into discrete states; in the\nupper level, they formed histograms by counting the HMM\nstates in local windows and designed a clustering algorithm\nto quantize histogram vectors into segment labels. Weiss at\nel [3] showed the potential of Non-negative Matrix Factor-\nization (NMF) in the structural segmentation problem. No-\ntably, they make use of sparseness constraint to automat-\nically determine the number of segment types in a song.\nKaiser et al [4] exploited NMF on self-similarity matrix and\nclustering to differentiate segment types.\nUndoubtedly, music structure is perceived based on many\nsources of information, among which harmony and timbre\nare primary players. Some existing systems use multiple\nfeatures as starting points, listed in [5], but few found a good\nmodel to combine them. As is shown in [4], combining har-\nmonic and timbral information works even worse than using\ntimbral information alone. In this paper, we focus on build-\ning a model to combine the two sources to reach higher seg-\nmentation performance.\nOur model is comprised of two parts. The Ô¨Årst part is a\ntwo-level clustering algorithm, which produces segment la-\nbels using either harmonic or timbral information. The sec-\nond part is a novel algorithm to bring segment labels from\ntwo different aspects together into a score matrix, and ex-\nploiting NMF to extract segment labels and sparseness to\nautomatically determine the number of segment types in a\ngiven song. We call the score matrix and NMF based algo-\nrithm SM-NMF for short.\nIn Section 2 we describe our two-level clustering algo-\nrithm. In Section 3 we describe the SM-NMF algorithm. In\nSection 4 we present our experimental results and explain\nfor them. In Section 5 we introduce possible extension of\nour model in future research. For convenience, we deÔ¨Åne the\nfollowing symbols that will be used in the paper. n: number\nof frames in a song, each corresponds to a state label. m:\ndimension of feature vectors. N: number of windows in a\nsong, each corresponds to a segment label. k: number of\nsegment types.\n477Poster Session 4\n2. TWO-LEVEL CLUSTERING\nOur two-level clustering algorithm is shown in Figure 1. From\nthe feature extraction module we get frame-based feature\nvectors used for the lower-level feature clustering module,\nwhich quantizes feature vectors into states. The histogram\nmodule counts states in windows and forms histogram vec-\ntors used for the higher-level histogram clustering module,\nwhich quantizes histogram vectors into segment labels. This\nalgorithm is similar to [2], except that we substitute HMMs\nwith another clustering and no constraint is imposed.\nfeature \nextraction  \nfeature \nextraction \nfeature \nclustering histogram histogram \nclustering two-level clustering \n  \n    \n       \n      frame \nframe window \nwindow \nFigure 1 . The Ô¨Çowchart and illustration of intermediate re-\nsults of two-level clustering. The lower two graphs‚Äô colors\nonly illustrate different labels for better looking.\n2.1 Feature Extraction\nWe extract two types of vector features separately from au-\ndio Ô¨Åles. Chroma is a 12-dimension representation indicat-\ning the power within each of the 12 pitch classes. So chroma\nhas a close relationship with the harmonic characteristics of\nmusic. See [6] for algorithm of extracting chroma. Mel-\nfrequency Cepstrum CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC) is usually a 13-\ndimension representation describing the spectral envelope.\nIt is easy to calculate and potential to reveal timbral simi-\nlarity in feature space. See [7] for algorithm of extracting\nMFCC.\nWe divide the whole song with Ô¨Åxed frame length of Lf\nms and hop size of Lfhms, then calculate feature for each\nframe.\n2.2 Clustering Algorithm\nClustering is a process of gathering points in the feature\nspace to a Ô¨Åxed number of clusters so that hopefully neigh-\nboring points would have the same cluster label. K-means\nis one of the most straightforward algorithms to perform\nclustering [8]. Firstly, a Ô¨Åxed number of kcluster centers\n¬µ1,¬µ2...¬µ kare initialized, often randomly. Then two stepsalternate iteratively: a) assign each point xjto its closest\ncluster center; b) recalculate each cluster center, until the\nobjective function\nG(x,¬µ) =k/summationdisplay\ni=1/summationdisplay\nxj‚ààCiDistanceMeasure (xj,¬µi)\nconverges, where Ciis the set of feature vectors assigned to\ntheith cluster. Note that k-means is the coordinate descent\nofG(x,¬µ)so only local minimum is guaranteed.\nIn our experiments, we Ô¨Ånd that using uniform distribu-\ntion to randomly initialize cluster centers sometimes con-\nverges to unreasonable local minima, so we apply an ‚Äúini-\ntial guess by splitting‚Äù method described in [9] instead. If\nthe target number of clusters is not power of 2, we split the\ncluster with largest variance until we achieve the right num-\nber. We Ô¨Ånd that using this technique most unreasonable\nresults are avoided.\nWe have described one level of clustering. Now we move\nto two-level clustering. Firstly, we perform clustering on ei-\nther chroma or MFCC into klclusters, using Euclidean dis-\ntance as distance measure, to obtain a state label for each\nframe, which can be interpreted as harmonic unit or timbre\nunit. Then we slide a window with length of Lwframes\nand hop size of Lwhframes throughout the whole song, and\ncount the occurrence of every state. Now we have an ar-\nray of histogram vectors, which are further normalized to\nbe probabilistic. We perform clustering on histogram vec-\ntors intokhclusters, using symmetric Kullback-Leiber (KL)\ndivergence [10] as distance measure.\nKL(P||Q) =1\nLwkl/summationdisplay\ni=1Pilog2Pi\nPi+Qi+Qilog2Qi\nPi+Qi\nSymmetric KL divergence describes how dissimilar Pand\nQare to the assumed actual distribution (P+Q)/2. The\nresulting labels indicate segment types.\nTo further reduce G(x,¬µ), we insert a random turbulence\nmodule between splitting initialization and two-step itera-\ntion, for both levels of clustering. To do this, we add a vector\nwith tiny norm and random direction to each cluster center.\nMake sure the shifted centers satisfy probability constraints\nfor KL divergence. Then we perform clustering for Ttimes\nto getTslightly different solutions. We can pick out the\nsolution with lowest G(x,¬µ).\nIn our experiments, we notice in most cases the solutions\nwith lowest G(x,¬µ)do not necessarily correspond to good\nresults (see Table 2 for results). Therefore, to further im-\nprove the performance, we have to keep all Tsolutions for\nfurther analysis.\n47812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3. COMBINING HARMONIC AND TIMBRAL\nINFORMATION\nIn this section, we describe how to combine harmonic and\ntimbral information, i.e. the two-level clustering results from\nchroma and MFCC, to produce better segmentation results.\nFor convenience, we name the segment labels produced by\nchroma as chroma solution. Similarly we have MFCC so-\nlution. We name the segment labels produced by the SM-\nNMF algorithm described below as Ô¨Ånal solution.\nTo motivate our idea, we show the typical results from\nchroma and MFCC respectively in Figure 2. Although both\nfeatures produce fair results (pairwise F-measure 0.61 and\n0.62), they are from completely different perspectives. For\nexample, the chroma solution fails to distinguish verse and\nverse(instrumental) because the underlying harmonic pat-\nterns are exactly the same, but is good at distinguishing\nverse and bridge because of different harmonic patterns; the\nMFCC solution separates verse(instrumental) successfully\nbecause the timbre in this segment is very different from oth-\ners, but cannot distinguish verse and bridge for their similar\ntimbres.\nTherefore, we set up the following rule for combination:\ntwo windows should have identical segment labels only if\nthe two windows are both harmonically and timbrally simi-\nlar. However, we cannot simply mix a chroma solution and\nan MFCC solution because segments from two aspects usu-\nally do not have common boundaries. There will often be\nlots of fragments in the outcoming results. In order to obtain\na result with the same level of detail as chroma or MFCC so-\nlution, we make use of all Tchroma solutions and TMFCC\nsolutions to smooth the boundaries. Now we describe how\nto bring all 2Tsolutions into one Ô¨Ånal solution.\nchroma \nMFCC \nintro  verse     bridge half  verse    bridge      verse      bridge  outro intro (instrumental) \nFigure 2 . The results of clustering using chroma and MFCC\nrespectively, along with the ground truth, of ‚ÄúIn My Life‚Äù.\n3.1 Score Matrix\nBy analyzing Tdifferent chroma or MFCC solutions from\nclustering with random turbulence, we Ô¨Ånd that typically\nsome pairs of windows always have identical labels. Thesewindows are lying within steady regions of a song. By con-\ntrast, some pairs occasionally have identical labels. Then ei-\nther of them is lying within boundary regions (for example\nthe short transition between segments with complicated in-\nstrumentation changes). Therefore, counting the times two\nwindows having identical labels can reveal the steady re-\ngions and boundary regions in a song. We can construct a\nscore matrix to describe how likely it is for two windows to\nhave identical labels. This idea can be directly extended to\na score matrix describing how likely it is for two windows\nto have identical labels in both chroma solution and MFCC\nsolution.\nTo implement this, initialize an N√óNmatrix with all ze-\nros. Perform two-level clustering using chroma and MFCC\nas feature separately, with splitting initialization and random\nturbulence, for Ttimes. Then investigate all the T2chroma-\nMFCC solution pairs: If the ith andjth windows in both\nchroma solution and MFCC solution have identical labels,\nthe corresponding element in the score matrix increases by\none. Finally, normalize all the elements by dividing by T2.\nThe resulting score matrix serves the same purpose of\nvisualizing music structure as Foote‚Äôs self-similarity matrix,\nbut the score matrix is much more well-structured and smooth.\nSee Figure 3 for a graphical example.\nFigure 3 . The score matrix of ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù. The same song‚Äôs\nself-similarity matrix is shown in [4].\n3.2 Non-Negative Matrix Factorization\nWe can view the score matrix as an array of column vec-\ntors. Each vector corresponds to a window. Suppose we\nhave a set of vector templates. Vectors in the steady regions\nof a song may be directly found in the set, while vectors in\nthe boundary regions may be approximated by linear com-\nbination of vector templates. This observation pushes us to\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [11].\nTheN√óNscore matrix is approximately factorized into\nproduct of a N√ókmatrix Wand ak√óNmatrix H. The\njth column of Wcan be viewed as the vector template for\nthejth segment type. The jth column of Hdescribes the\nintensities of the ksegment types for the jth window. An\nexample in shown in Figure 4.\n479Poster Session 4\nWe implement NMF using the multiplicative update rules\n[11]. Similar to clustering, NMF can only guarantee a local\nminimum of the sum of errors between the score matrix and\nW√óH. So we run NMF for several times with uniformly\ndistributed random initialization and pick out the factoriza-\ntion result with lowest sum of errors.\nAfter we obtain H, we apply Maximum Likelihood by\nassigning the segment label associated with the largest en-\nergy to each window. Note that in [4], clustering was used\nfor the same purpose. In our experiment, we Ô¨Ånd that clus-\ntering and Maximum Likelihood produce almost the same\nperformance. We choose Maximum Likelihood because it‚Äôs\nsimpler and more consistent.\n  \nscore matrix ( √ó )   ( √ó )   ( √ó ) \nFigure 4 . The score matrix is approximately factorized into\nthe product of WandH, from ‚ÄúDrive My Car‚Äù.\n3.3 Automatic Determination of the Number of\nSegment Types\nAutomatically determining of the number of segment types\nin a song is hard for two-level clustering, because clustering\nis a process of hard decision and all information about a win-\ndow is its associated cluster label. However, using NMF, we\nhave the matrix Hwhose columns involve intensities of all\nsegment types. An example is shown in Figure 5. Intuitively\none will agree k= 3is the optimal number of segment types\nbecause the Hwithk= 3 is the most ‚Äúresolute‚Äù one with\nleast windows having much energy spread into multiple seg-\nment types. So we want a measure to quantify how much\nenergy of a column is concentrated in as few components\nas possible. Sparseness [12] is a good measure which can\nsatisfy the need.\nsparseness (h) =‚àö\nk‚àí(/summationtext|hi|)//radicalBig/summationtexthi2\n‚àö\nk‚àí1\nwhere his a column of H. The sparseness listed in Figure 5\nis the average sparseness of all Ncolumns. We hope the\ncolumns of Hto be as sparse as possible, so we factorize\nthe score matrix with different k, then we pick out the H\nwith largest average sparseness.\nTo summarize, we show the whole process of our model\nin Figure 6.\n =2,           =0.789  \n =3,           =0.939  \n =4,           =0.881  \n =5,          =0.879 (optimal)  Figure 5 .

All\nsongs are in the wav format of 16kHz/16bit/mono. We eval-\nuate pairwise F-measure (PFM) [2] of our algorithms on the\nwhole database referencing Isophonics annotations. Clus-\ntering processes with chroma and MFCC share the same set\nof parameters in Table 1.\nTable 2 shows the PFM of two-level clustering with split-\nting initialization and without random turbulence, and the\nPFM of running two-level clustering with splitting initial-\nization and random turbulence for Ttimes and minimiza-\ntion with regard to G(x,¬µ).kcannot be automatically de-\ntermined in clustering, so we Ô¨Åx k= 3, which can produce\nhighest PFM in our experiments.\nchroma MFCC\nrandom no yes no yes\nPFM 0.58 0.58 0.58 0.60\nTable 2 .

We note that although\nmany songs have more than 5 segment types according to\nannotations, such as the one shown in Figure 2, intro and\nhalf-intro are both harmonically and timbrally identical so\nit is impossible to discriminate them using only harmonic\nand timbral information. Therefore it is normal that the au-\ntomatically determined kis smaller than the actual number\nof segment types in annotations. In Table 3, besides SM-\nNMF, we also show the results using NMF with Ô¨Åxed kfor\ncomparison.

In the chroma\nsolution, we see that a verse is oversegmented into three\nsegments (blue, red, green). We see in the score matrix\nthat the red-labeled segment is tolerated in larger boxes but\nthe green-labeled segment is not. This is because the red-\nlabeled segment is a correctable mistake produced by some\nunstable clustering results, while the green-labeled segment\nis an uncorrectable mistake produced by the interference\nfrom heavy drumming. In the MFCC solution, we see that\nthe Ô¨Årst and second verse are given different label from the\nthird and fourth verse. This is produced by the differences\nin background choir, by which MFCC solution is conÔ¨Ådent\nthat they have two distinct timbres. So we see in the score\nmatrix the upper left four large boxes are completely sep-\narated from the lower right four large boxes. The Ô¨Ånal so-\nlution will hide all correctable mistakes but display all un-\ncorrectable mistakes. Therefore, SM-NMF performs well\nwhen the front-end structural segmentation algorithm (two-\nlevel clustering for this paper) makes as few uncorrectable\nmistakes as possible.\n481Poster Session 4\nintro  verse    verse   bridge   verse  bridge  verse outro \n  \nFigure 7 .

SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORKS\nWe have described a novel model for music structural seg-\nmentation, to bring the results of two-level clustering using\nchroma and MFCC separately into one Ô¨Ånal solution, aim-\ning at combining harmonic and timbral information. We\nuse splitting initialization and random turbulence to pro-\nduce slightly different chroma and MFCC solutions from\ntwo-level clustering. Then we construct a score matrix to\nexhibit the pairwise relation between chroma solutions and\nMFCC solutions. We apply NMF and Maximum Likelihood\nto reveal music structure and sparseness to automatically de-\ntermine the number of segment types in a given song. The\nPFM of our proposed SM-NMF method outperforms two-\nlevel clustering using single feature.\nThere is lots of space for improvement. We have shown\nin Section 4.3 that one obstacle in SM-NMF method is the\nreliability of solutions of the front-end algorithm. The two-\nlevel clustering can be replaced by any structural segmen-\ntation algorithm as long as random turbulence is included\nto produce slightly different solutions. We note that the re-\nliability is not equivalent to the value of PFM, because for\nexample we cannot expect MFCC alone to identify harmon-\nically different segments or discriminate intro and half-intro.\nWe need ground truth directly related to harmonically simi-\nlar segments or timbrally similar segments.\nBesides, NMF might produce better results with someconstraints exploiting symmetry and sparsity. The score ma-\ntrix is a Ô¨Çexible representation, which might be associated\nwith probabilistic models. For example, if we view the score\nmatrix as a ‚Äúterm frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-\nidf)‚Äù matrix, we might make use of Probabilistic Latent Se-\nmantic Analysis [14] to give a more elegant algorithm. We\nmight also introduce constraints such as segment length and\ninter-segment transition probabilities to produce more mu-\nsically meaningful results.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] J.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic lovers have always been faced with a large collec-\ntion of music recordings or concert performances for them\nto choose from. While successful choices are possible with\na small set of metadata, disappointment still recurs becaus e\nthe metadata only provides limited information about the\nmusical contents. This has motivated researchers to work\non systems that extract essential musical information from\naudio recordings. Hopefully, such systems will enable per-\nsonalized recommendations for music purchase decisions.\nIn this paper, we focus on the extraction of vocal melodies\nfrom polyphonic audio signals. A melody is deÔ¨Åned as a\nsuccession of pitches and durations; as one might expect,\nmelodies represent the most signiÔ¨Åcant piece of informatio n\namong all the features one can identify from a piece of mu-\nsic. In various musical cultures including popular music in\nparticular, predominant melodies are commonly carried by\nsinging voices. In view of this, this work aims at analyzing a\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval .singing voice accompanied by musical instruments. Instru-\nmental accompaniment is common in vocal music, where\nthe main melodies are exclusively carried by a solo singing\nvoice, with the musical instruments providing harmony. In\nbrief, the goal of the analysis considered in this work is\nÔ¨Ånding the fundamental frequency of the singing voice as\na function of time.\nThe speciÔ¨Åc problem outlined above is challenging be-\ncause melody extraction is prone to interference from the\naccompaniment unless a mechanism is in place for distin-\nguishing human voice from instrumental sound. [6], [13],\nand [9] determined the predominant pitch as it accounts for\nthe most of the signal power among all the simultaneous\npitches. The concept of pitch predominance is also pre-\nsented in [12] and [2], which deÔ¨Åned the predominance in\nterms of harmonicity. For these methods, the problem proves\ndifÔ¨Åcult whenever the signal is dominated by a harmonic\nmusical instrument rather than by the singing voice. [3] and\n[5] realized the timbre recognition mechanism by classiÔ¨Å-\ncation techniques; on the other hand, pitch classiÔ¨Åcation\nentails quantization of pitch, which in turn causes loss of\nsuch musical information as vibrato, portamento, and non-\nstandard tuning.\nThe contribution of this paper is an acoustic-phonetic\napproach to vocal melody extraction. To make judgments\nabout whether or not each particular pitch contour detected\nin the polyphonic audio is vocal, we measure a timbral dis-\ntance between the pitch contour and a space of human voiced\nsound derived from acoustic phonetics [4]. In this space,\nhuman voiced sound is parameterized by a small number of\nacoustic phonetic variables, and the timbral distance from\nthe space to any harmonic sound can be efÔ¨Åciently estimated\nby a coordinate descent search that Ô¨Ånds the minimum dis-\ntance between a point in the space and the point representing\nthe harmonic sound.\nThe proposed method offers practical advantages over\nprevious approaches to vocal melody extraction. By im-\nposing acoustic-phonetic constraints on the extraction, t he\nproposed method can better distinguish human voice from\n25Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\ninstrumental sound than the predominant pitch estimators i n\n[2, 6, 9, 12, 13]. Furthermore, with pitch contours composed\nof continuous sinusoidal frequency estimates taken from in -\nterpolated spectra, the proposed method is free from the\nquantization errors in pitch estimation that are commonly\nencountered by classiÔ¨Åcation-based systems [3, 5].\nFigure 1 . Short-term processing for vocal melody extrac-\ntion. The goal is to extract a vocal pitch contour around\ntime point tfrom the polyphonic audio. TDM stands for\ntimbral distance measurement.\n2. OVERVIEW OF SHORT-TERM PROCESSING\nIn this section, we consider the problem of extracting a vo-\ncal pitch contour around time point tfrom the polyphonic\naudio, provided that a singing voice exists at t. As shown in\nFigure 1, the extraction proceeds in three steps: 1) detect-\ning pitch contours that each start before and end after t, 2)\nmeasuring the timbral distance between each of the detected\ncontours and the space of human voiced sound, and 3) ex-\ntracting the most salient pitch contour among any detected\ncontours that lie in the space of human voiced sound.\nIn particular, the pitch contours simultaneously detected\nin Step 1 form a set of candidates for the vocal pitch contour.\nIf exactly one vocal exists at this moment, then the vocal\ncontour may be identiÔ¨Åed by timbre. Timbral distance mea-\nsurement is intended here to provide the timbral informatio n\nessential to the identiÔ¨Åcation. In contrast to frame-based\nprocessing, here the duration of processing depends on how\nfar pitches can actually be tracked continuously away from\ntin the analyzed audio. At the frame rate of 100 frames per\nsecond, it is observed that most pitch contours last for more\nthan 10 frames; obviously, one would expect more reliable\ntimbral judgments from contour-based processing than from\nframe-based processing.\n3. PITCH CONTOUR DETECTION\nIn this section, we describe the procedure for detecting pit ch\ncontours around time point tfrom the polyphonic audio. It\nstarts by detecting multiple pitches from the audio frame\natt. Next, pitch tracking is performed separately for each\ndetected pitch, from tforwards, and then also from tback-\nwards, as depicted in Figure 2. Consequently, this procedur e\ngives as many pitch contours as pitches are detected at t.\nFigure 2 . Bi-directional multi-pitch tracking around time\npointt.\n3.1 Pitch Detection\nIn order to detect pitches at the time point t, we apply si-\nnusoidal analysis to the short-time spectrum of the poly-\nphonic audio signal at t. The analysis extracts (quadrati-\ncally interpolated) frequencies of the loudest three peaks in\nthe Ô¨Årst-formant section (200‚Äì1000 hertz) of the magnitude\nspectrum. The loudness of a sinusoid is computed by cor-\nrecting its amplitude according to the trends in the 40-phon\nequal-loudness contour (ELC) [8], which quantiÔ¨Åes the de-\npendency of human loudness perception on frequency. For\neach extracted sinusoidal frequency Àúf(hertz), the procedure\n‚Äúdetects‚Äù up to three pitches in the 80‚Äì1000 hertz vocal pitc h\nrange, at Àúf,Àúf/2, andÀúf/3, regarding the sinusoid as the fun-\ndamental, the second partial, or the third partial of a pitch .\nAs a result, the pitch detector gives nine pitches at the most\nfor the time point t. The ambiguity among the Ô¨Årst three\npartials will not be resolved until a selection is made among\npitch contours.\n3.2 Pitch Tracking\nSuppose that we are now appending a new pitch to the end\nof a growing pitch contour. Calculation of the new pitch\nproceeds in three steps: 1) Ô¨Ånding in the new spectrum a set\nof sinusoids around (within one half tone of) the Ô¨Årst three\npartials of the last pitch in the contour, 2) Ô¨Ånding among the\nsinusoids the one with the highest amplitude, and 3) dividin g\nthe frequency (hertz) of this sinusoid by the corresponding\nharmonic multiple (1, 2, or 3). In other words, the pitch\ncontour is guided by nearby high-energy pitch candidates.\nThe growth of a pitch contour stops once the amplitude of\nthe loudest partial drops (cumulatively) from a peak value\nby more than 9 dB, i.e., a speciÔ¨Åc form of onset or offset\nis detected, with the loudness of each partial evaluated ove r\nthe entire contour as a time average.\n4. TIMBRAL DISTANCE MEASUREMENT\nIn this section, we develop a method for measuring the tim-\nbral deviation of a pitch contour Cfrom human voiced sound,\nwhich is based on an acoustic-phonetic parameterization of\n2612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nhuman voiced sound, and Ô¨Ånding within the space of human\nvoiced sound the minimum distance from C, as illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3 . Measuring the timbral distance between a pitch\ncontour (star) and the space of human voiced sound.\n4.1 Parameterization of Human Voiced Sound\nIn order to model the space of human voiced sound, it is\ndesirable to identify every point in the space with a set of\nacoustic-phonetic parameters. To this end, we let each shor t-\ntime magnitude spectrum of human voiced sound be repre-\nsented by seven parameters: the amplitude, the fundamental\nfrequency, the Ô¨Årst three formant frequencies, and the nasa l\nformant and anti-formant frequencies [11]. Such a parame-\nterization is appropriate for specifying human voiced soun d\nin that sinusoidal parameters of the voice can be obtained\nfrom the acoustic-phonetic parameters through well-deÔ¨Åne d\nprocedures. Obviously, partial frequencies of the human\nvoiced sound can be derived as integer multiples of the fun-\ndamental frequency. On the other hand, partial amplitudes\nof the human voiced sound can be derived on the basis of\nformant synthesis [4], which has been applied to synthesiz-\ning a wide range of realistic singing voice [15].\nConsider a point in the space of human voiced sound\ns= (a,f0,f1,f2,f3,fp,fz)T, (1)\nwhereais the amplitude (in dB), f0is the fundamental fre-\nquency (in quarter tones), f1,f2, andf3are the Ô¨Årst three\nformant frequencies (in hertz), and fpandfzare the nasal\nformant and anti-formant frequencies (in hertz).

(11)\n27Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nThe accuracy in determining whether or not Cis vocal\ndepends on how well the distance in (9) is numerically min-\nimized. To be speciÔ¨Åc, if Cis vocal and the timbral distance\nbetweenCand the space of human voiced sound is over-\nestimated due to distance minimization being trapped in a\nlocal minimum, then Cmay very likely turn out to be mis-\ntaken by the procedure for an instrumental contour. Our\nnumerical experience revealed that the best of twenty local\nsearches for the minimum deÔ¨Åned in (10), which are ini-\ntialized respectively with twenty different reference poi nts,\nshows great consistency in associating vocal pitch contour s\nwith short timbral distances. These reference points diffe r\nonly in the oral formant frequencies f1,f2, andf3, with nu-\nmerical values taken from the gender-speciÔ¨Åc averages for\nten vowels of American English [10]: i, I,E, √¶,A,O,U, u,\n2, and √á. Although each individual search is local by nature\nand can only be expected to give a local minimum in some\nneighborhood of the corresponding starting point, the glob al\nminimum can be found as long as it can be reached from one\nof the twenty initial points.\nFigure 4 . Each update in the local search for the minimum\ndistance consists of a series of one-variable subproblems.\nThe local search for the minimum deÔ¨Åned in (10) may\nbe achieved with any local optimization technique. Here we\nuse a simple coordinate descent algorithm, as represented i n\nFigure 4, where each (all-variable) update consists of a se-\nries of one-variable updates. Each one-variable update min -\nimizes the distance with respect to the variable alone while\nÔ¨Åxing the other variables. For instance, the update of the\nformant frequency f2in thejth all-variable update operates\non the current point\n(a(j),f(j)\n1,f(j‚àí1)\n2,f(j‚àí1)\n3,f(j‚àí1)\np,f(j‚àí1)\nz)T(12)\nby computing\nf(j)\n2= arg min\nf2‚ààI2\nDC/parenleftBig\n(a(j),f(j)\n1,f2,f(j‚àí1)\n3,f(j‚àí1)\np,f(j‚àí1)\nz)T/parenrightBig\n,\nI2={f2‚ààR|600‚â§f2‚â§3000,f(j)\n1‚â§f2‚â§f(j‚àí1)\n3}.\n(13)\nIn our implementation, the subproblem (13) is solved by\nÔ¨Ånding a local minimum over a 100-hertz-spaced samplingoff2aroundf(j‚àí1)\n2 . The subproblem for updating the am-\nplitudeacan be solved analytically, as it is equivalent to\nminimizing a quadratic function of a. The Ô¨Ånal numerical\nsolution to the problem (10) is reÔ¨Åned by continuing the\nlocal search with a 10-hertz spacing of formant frequency\nsampling.\n5. PITCH CONTOUR SELECTION\nIn this section, we present a procedure for selecting the vo-\ncal pitch contour from a set of pitch contours detected aroun d\ntime point t. To begin with, it prunes those pitch contours\nthat have been associated with a long timbral distance from\nthe space of human voiced sound. A pitch contour is ac-\ncepted only if the timbral distance does not exceed the em-\npirical threshold of‚àö‚àí2log0.4. In addition, if the mean\namplitude over even partials of a pitch contour exceeds that\nover odd partials by more than 7 dB, the contour is rejected,\ntaken as the octave below a true pitch contour.\nSecondly, the procedure prunes some pitch contours that\ncan be seen as an overtone as related to another pitch con-\ntour. To this end, the overlap time interval between each\npair of contours is calculated, and the pitch interval betwe en\ntwo contours is determined on the basis of the mean pitch\nduring the overlap. The procedure rejects any pitch contour\nthat has a mean pitch at the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th partial of another\ncontour.\nLastly, the procedure selects the loudest pitch contour\nfrom any contours that survived the prunings, thereby pro-\nviding a mechanism for identifying the predominant lead\nvocal out of several simultaneous singing voices. The loud-\nness of each pitch contour is deÔ¨Åned as the mean of its\ninstantaneous loudness values, which are each calculated\nby summing the linear-scale, ELC-corrected instantaneous\npower over the partials.\n6. LONG-TERM PROCESSING\nAt the excerpt level, the goal of processing is an interleave d\nsequence of vocal pitch contours and pauses. To this end, we\nmaintain a list of visited frames throughout the segmentation\nprocess. A frame is considered visited whenever a vocal\npitch contour has been extracted whose duration covers the\nframe.\nSuppose that at this moment the procedure has extracted\nkvocal pitch contours from the excerpt, with the list of vis-\nited frames updated accordingly. The procedure attempts to\nextract the (k+ 1) th contour around time point t, which is\nset to the unvisited frame that has the highest signal loud-\nness among all the unvisited frames. Here, the loudness\nof a frame is calculated by summing the linear-scale, ELC-\ncorrected power over sharp peaks in the spectrum. The sharp-\nness threshold of each spectral local maximum is set to 9\n2812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndB above the mean amplitude over the neighboring 5 fre-\nquency bins. In case that the new contour should overlap\nwith an existing contour, the new contour would be trun-\ncated to resolve the conÔ¨Çict. This procedure continues unti l\nthe loudness of every unvisited frame is below the excerpt-\nwide median. These remaining unvisited frames form the\nÔ¨Ånal pauses between vocal pitch contours.\n7. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, to provide comparison of our method with\nsome existing methods, we conduct vocal melody extraction\nexperiments on a publicly available dataset.\n7.1 Dataset Description\nThe dataset is a subset of the one built for the Melody Ex-\ntraction Contest in the ISMIR2004 Audio Description Con-\ntest (ADC 2004). The whole ADC 2004 dataset consists of\n20 audio recordings, each around 20 seconds in duration,\namong which eight recordings have instrumental melodies,\nand the other twelve have vocal melodies. Since this work\nconsiders vocal melodies only, experiments are carried out\nexclusively on the 12 vocal recordings, including four pop\nsong excerpts, four song excerpts with synthesized vocal,\nand four opera excerpts. The dataset has been in use in\nseveral Music Information Retrieval Evaluation Exchange\n(MIREX) contests since 2006; therefore, it affords exten-\nsive comparison among methods.\nBefore melody extraction, each audio Ô¨Åle in the dataset\nis resampled at 11,025 hertz and constant- Qtransformed [1]\n(Q= 34 ) into a sequence of short-time spectra. Each result-\ning spectrum is a quarter-tone-spaced sampling of a contin-\nuous spectrum that is capable of resolving the interference\nbetween two half-tone-spaced sinusoids from 21.827 hertz\nall the way to 5,428.6 hertz.\n7.2 Performance Measures\nIn the experiments documented here, the tested system gives\nvocal melodies in the format of a voicing/pitch value for\neach frame (at the rate of 100 frames per second). If a frame\nis estimated to be within the duration of a vocal pitch con-\ntour, the output speciÔ¨Åes the pitch estimate for the frame;\notherwise, the output speciÔ¨Åes that the frame is estimated t o\nbe not voiced.\nMIREX adopts several measures for evaluating the per-\nformance of a melody extraction system [14]. In the Ô¨Årst\nplace, to determine how well the system performs voicing\ndetection, we use the voicing detection rate, the voicing fa lse\nalarm rate, and the discriminability. The voicing detectio n\nrate is computed as the fraction of frames that are both la-\nbeled and estimated to be voiced, among all the frames that\nare labeled voiced. The voicing false alarm rate is computedas the fraction of frames that are estimated to be voiced but\nare actually not voiced, among all the frames that are not\nvoiced according to the reference transcription. The dis-\ncriminability combines the above two measures in such a\nway that it can be deemed independent of the value of any\nthreshold involved in the decision of voicing detection:\nd‚Ä≤=Q‚àí1(PF)+Q‚àí1(1‚àíPD), (14)\nwhereQ‚àí1(¬∑)denotes the inverse of the Gaussian tail func-\ntion,PFdenotes the false alarm rate, and PDdenotes the\ndetection rate.\nSecond, to determine how well the system performs pitch\nestimation, we use the raw pitch accuracy and the raw chroma\naccuracy. The raw pitch accuracy is computed as the frac-\ntion of frames that are labeled voiced and have pitch esti-\nmated within one quarter tone of the true pitch, among all\nthe frames that are labeled voiced. To focus on pitch class\nestimation while ignoring octave errors, we compute the raw\nchroma accuracy, which is computed in the same way as the\nraw pitch accuracy, except that the pitch is here measured in\nterms of chroma, or pitch class, a quantity derived from the\npitch by wrapping the pitch into one octave.\nFinally, the performance of voicing detection and pitch\nestimation can be measured jointly by the overall transcrip -\ntion accuracy, deÔ¨Åned as the fraction of frames that receive\ncorrect voicing classiÔ¨Åcation and, if voiced, a pitch esti-\nmate within one quarter tone of the true pitch, among all\nthe frames.\nTable 1 . Experimental results.\n7.3 Results\nThe results are listed in Table 1. The overall transcription\naccuracies listed in the column titled ‚ÄúAll‚Äù range from 61%\nto 96% and have their average at 77.007%. The minimum\nis found at the excerpt ‚Äúopera_fem2.‚Äù A close look at a sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant error made in the analysis of this excerpt revealed\nthat the system mistakenly selected the octave below a true\n29Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nvocal pitch contour because the octave had a timbral dis-\ntance of‚àö‚àí2log0.41, slightly shorter than the upper limit\nset for a vocal contour. Still, the distance measured for the\ntrue vocal pitch contour was much shorter, at‚àö‚àí2log0.98.\nThis suggests that a relative threshold for the timbral dis-\ntance may be implemented along with the absolute threshold\nto further improve the accuracy. To see the effect of timbral\ndistance measurement on the average accuracy, we repeated\nthe experiments with the distance threshold set to inÔ¨Ånity, so\nthat no contour was pruned because of a large timbral devi-\nation from human voiced sound. This turned out to reduce\nthe mean accuracy from 77.007% to 75.233%, which veri-\nÔ¨Åes the beneÔ¨Åt of timbral distance measurement. The raw\npitch accuracies in the column titled ‚ÄúV oiced‚Äù are highly\ncorrelated with the overall transcription accuracies, whi ch\nsuggests that further improvement of this system should be\nmade in pitch estimation, not in voicing detection. The col-\numn titled ‚ÄúChroma‚Äù contains raw chroma accuracies sim-\nilar to the raw pitch accuracies, which suggests that octave\nerrors were successfully avoided by the system.\nShown in Table 2 is a comparison of the proposed method\nwith the MIREX 2009 submissions in terms of the over-\nall transcription accuracy (OTA). Notably, if the proposed\nmethod had entered the evaluation in 2009, it would have\nranked 5th out of a total of 13 submissions. Moreover, the\naccuracy of the proposed system is within 10% of the high-\nest accuracy in the 2009 evaluation.\nTable 2 . Comparison with the MIREX 2009 Audio Melody\nExtraction results.\n8. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a novel method for vocal melody extrac-\ntion which is based on an acoustic-phonetic model of human\nvoiced sound. The performance of this method is evaluated\non a publicly available dataset and proves comparable with\nstate-of-the-art methods.1\n9.

INTRODUCTION\nThe majority of state of the art chord recognition systems\nare based on frame-wise analysis of chroma features ex-\ntracted from an input signal. The chord sequence is deter-\nmined by a pattern matching process that measures the Ô¨Åt\nbetween a set of predeÔ¨Åned chord models and each frame of\nthe input chromagram. In order to precisely identify chord\nboundaries, the frame rate of the chroma features is typi-\ncally faster than the rate of chord changes in music. How-\never, this makes the chroma features sensitive to local tran-\nsients and noise in the signal. A popular choice to cope\nwith this problem is to pre-process the chromagram using\neither a low-pass Ô¨Ålter or a median Ô¨Ålter prior to the pat-\ntern matching process. Both Ô¨Ålters blur out transients and\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.noise in the signal by smoothing the features across neigh-\nboring frames. Another favored approach is using a Viterbi\ndecoder that Ô¨Ånds the most likely sequence of chords based\non the chord-type probabilities estimated from the pattern\nmatching process. By reducing the number of chord tran-\nsitions using a relatively high self-transition probability (the\nprobability of remaining in a chord), the Viterbi decoder can\nÔ¨Ålter out spurious transitions caused by short bursts of noise.\nIn our previous work [4], we found that the combina-\ntion of pre-Ô¨Åltering (either a moving average Ô¨Ålter or a me-\ndian Ô¨Ålter) and post-Ô¨Åltering (the Viterbi decoder) does not\nyield a synergistic impact on performance, although many\nsystems use the combination [2, 6]. This is because the ef-\nfects of pre-Ô¨Åltering substantially overlap with those of post-\nÔ¨Åltering, i.e. they carry out essentially the same function in\nthe sense of constraining sudden movements over a short\nseries of local frames.\nIn this paper, we propose a feature smoothing technique\nbased on an important aspect of music, repetition. By aver-\naging repeated chroma patterns within a piece of music, our\nmethod attenuates unsystematic deviations and noise and\nreinforces harmonic information of chroma frames. This\nmethod is inspired by the one proposed by Mauch et al. [6].\nIn their approach, the information about the repetitive struc-\nture of songs is used to enhance chroma features for chord\nestimation. They use a conventional frame-by-frame self-\nsimilarity matrix generated from a beat-synchronous chro-\nmagram. From the matrix, they extract repeated chord pro-\ngressions of equal length by examining all diagonal lines.\nThe beat and bar information estimated from a song play a\ncrucial role in their greedy algorithm to Ô¨Ånd repeated sec-\ntions. The found segments are merged into larger segment\ntypes (e.g. verse and chorus) without overlapping. Their\nnew features are then obtained by averaging chroma features\nfrom multiple occurrences of the same segment type.\nUnlike Mauch et al., our method decides which repeated\nparts to include in the smoothing process by a simple thresh-\nolding operation using the technique of recurrence plots. As\nour method doesn‚Äôt use beat and bar information, it avoid\nthe errors in the initial feature analysis (e.g. onset detec-\n651Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nRecurrence Plot0100020003000400050006000700080009000‚àí0.1‚àí0.0500.050.10.15AudioChroma FeaturesFeature reconstructionNew Chroma FeaturesTime-delay embeddingWeight MatrixFigure 1 .

In\nour method, repeated sections are not limited to a few large\nunits (e.g. chorus or verse), but include smaller units such\nas chords. Thus, our method can generate new chroma fea-\ntures using relatively many repeated frames collected from\nall across the song. As the repeated frames are assumed to\nhave the same harmonic content, the smoothing only occurs\nwithin the same chords, thus preserving boundary informa-\ntion. In our experiments, this smoothing method yields bet-\nter results than the conventional methods in all cases includ-\ning the combination with the Viterbi decoder.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In\nSection 2, we provide a detailed description of our method.\nIn Section 3, we describe the data and evaluation method-\nology used in our experiments. The results and discussions\nare provided in Section 4, and our conclusions and direc-\ntions for future work are presented in Section 5.\n2. APPROACH\nThe block diagram of our feature smoothing process is shown\nin Figure 1. First, the audio signal is segmented and trans-\nformed into chroma features. The chroma features are then\nprojected into phase space using time-delay embedding prior\nto calculating the recurrence plot. The weight matrix is de-\nrived from the recurrence plot, and combined with the orig-\ninal chroma features as a coefÔ¨Åcient set in the feature re-\nconstruction process. To measure the performance of our\nmethod on various types of chroma features, we evaluate our\nmethod on conventional chroma features and one of their\nmost recent variants, CRP features [7]. The following sub-\nsections discuss the details of the approach including the\nfeature set and our methodology for generating and apply-\ning the weight matrix to construct new chroma features.2.1 Chroma Features\nPitch Class ProÔ¨Åle (PCP), or chroma features, represent the\nenergy of the audio signal present in each of the twelve pitch\nclasses of the chromatic scale. In this paper, the chroma\nfeatures are derived from a slightly modiÔ¨Åed version of the\nconstant-Q transform [3] by mapping each frequency bin of\nthe constant-Q spectrum to a corresponding pitch class. Let\nus deÔ¨Åne the kthbin constant-Q kernel function as:\nKk(m) =œâk(m)e‚àíj2œÄfkm, m‚àà[0,Nk‚àí1] (1)\nwhereœâkis a Hamming window of length Nk, which varies\nwith the center frequency fkso that it has a Ô¨Åxed Q-value.\nThe center frequency fkis based on the equal tempered\nscale such that:\nfk= 2k/Œ≤fmin (2)\nwhereŒ≤is the number of bins per octave, and fminis the\nminimum analysis frequency.\nThe constant-Q transform Xcqof a segmented audio sig-\nnalx(m),m‚àà[0,Nseg‚àí1]is then calculated as:\nXcq(k) =1\nmin(Nseg,Nk)N‚àí1/summationdisplay\nŒΩ=0X(ŒΩ)K‚àó\nk(ŒΩ) (3)\nwhereN >Nk‚àÄk,X(ŒΩ)is theN-point DFT of the signal,\nandK‚àó\nk(ŒΩ)is the conjugate of the N-point DFT of the kth\nkernel function. The signal and kernel functions are padded\nwith trailing zeros to length Nprior to applying the DFT. To\nprevent underestimation of low frequencies where Nseg<\nNk, the smaller value between NsegandNkis used as the\nnormalization factor. In this paper, we use Œ≤= 36 , with\nthe analysis performed between fmin= 27.5 Hz and fmax=\n4186 Hz (i.e. corresponding to the MIDI pitches 21 to 108).\nThe STFT window length Nsegis 8192 (186 ms), and hop\nsize is 4096 (93 ms) samples at 44100 Hz sample rate.\nA 12-bins per octave spectrum P(p),p‚àà[1,Np]is ob-\ntained by combining adjacent bins of the Xcq(k)usingŒ≤/12-\nwide non-overlapping Gaussian windows. To avoid percus-\nsive noise (e.g. bass drums) in low frequencies and to atten-\nuate the effect of non-harmonic tones caused by high-order\nharmonics in high frequencies, P(p)is windowed with a\nGaussian centered at C4 (MIDI pitch 60). Finally, a chroma\nvectorC={cb},b‚àà[1,12]can simply be calculated by\nfolding the spectrum P(p).\n2.2 CRP Features\nCRP (C hroma DCT-R educed log P itch) features, proposed\nby M ¬®uller et al. [7], are one of the most recent variants of\nconventional chroma features. Their derivation is inspired\nby Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs) which are\npopular in speech and music recognition. First, the spectrum\nP(p)is logarithmized using log(P(p)¬∑Œ≥+1) with a suitable\n65212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n10020030040050060070080090010001002003004005006007008009001000\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91(a)Si,j\n  \n10020030040050060070080090010001002003004005006007008009001000\n01 (b)Ri,j\n  \n10020030040050060070080090010001002003004005006007008009001000\n00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 (c)Wi,j\nFigure 2 .

Finally, the cepstrum is transformed back using\nthe inverse DCT, and the resulting pitch vectors are summa-\nrized into the 12-dimensional chroma vectors, CRP. It is\nimportant to note that by removing the DC component from\nthe cepstrum, a CRPvector contains both positive and neg-\native values. The feature vectors are then normalized by the\n/lscript2-norm. In this paper, we use Œ≥= 1000 andŒæ= 25 as\nsuggested by [7].\nThe main advantage of using CRP features for chord recog-\nnition comes from applying logarithmic compression on the\nspectrumP(p). In conventional chroma features, melodies\nand bass lines are problematic, because they generate sin-\ngle high-energy peaks that dominate the chroma feature dis-\ntributions to the detriment of the background harmony of\nthe frame. The logarithm de-emphasizes the dominant pitch\nsalience while boosting the background harmonic contents.\nIn addition, by removing low coefÔ¨Åcients from the cepstrum\n(i.e. formants, spectral shape), CRP features maximize the\neffect of compression and become invariant to changes in\ntimbre.\n2.3 Recurrence Plot and Weight Matrix\nThe weight matrix is computed using recurrence plot (RP)\ntheory, which provides a sophisticated way to analyze se-\nquential data [5], and have been previously used with chroma\nfeatures in other MIR tasks such as cover version identiÔ¨Å-\ncation [9], and recently, in structural similarity [1]. A key\nfeature of recurrence plots is the use of time-delay embed-\nding. Time-delay embedding is a method for transforming\na time series into a multidimensional sequence of lagged\ndata. In other words, it provides a way to transform frame-\nby-frame analysis into n-gram analysis (i.e. subsequence-\nby-subsequence).\nThenthtime-delay embedded chroma vector ÀáC(n)can be\nconstructed by concatenating all the elements of a chroma\nsequenceC(n) ={cb(n)},b‚àà[1,12]from timenton+(M‚àí1)œÑas:\nÀáC(n) =/parenleftbig\nc1(n),c1(n+œÑ),...,c 1(n+ (M‚àí1)œÑ),...\nc12(n),c12(n+œÑ),...,c 12(n+ (M‚àí1)œÑ)/parenrightbig\n(4)\nÀáC(n)is then normalized to have unit length. The self-similarity\nmatrixSi,jis calculated as:\nSi,j=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleÀáC(i)‚àíÀáC(j)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\n2(5)\nwherei,j‚àà[1,N],Nis the length of the time-delay em-\nbedded chroma sequence, and ||¬∑|| is the Euclidean norm.\nThe normalization factor (the constant 2 in the denominator)\nis the maximum possible distance value between unit length\nvectors. Hence, 0‚â§Si,j‚â§1,‚àÄi,j‚àà[1,N].\nUnlike a conventional frame-by-frame self-similarity ma-\ntrix (i.e. a special case of Si,jwith parameters M= 1 and\nœÑ= 1), the additional embedding process makes the matrix\nmore robust to short term noise or deviations by evaluating\nvectors of sample sequences (i.e. M¬∑œÑlength sequence)\ninstead of using only samples. An RP can be obtained from\nSi,jwith a suitable threshold /epsilon1as:\nRi,j=H(/epsilon1‚àíSi,j), i,j‚àà[1,N] (6)\nwhereHis the Heaviside step function. The choice of /epsilon1\nis important because it is the only criterion to determine\nwhich parts are actually repeated. However, a global thresh-\nolding with a Ô¨Åxed threshold is not appropriate in our case,\nbecause the useful range of thresholds can vary greatly be-\ntween songs or even within a given song. A better strategy\nis to simply match the number of nearest neighbors in the\nphase space constructed by Eqn. (4). In this approach, /epsilon1(n)\nis deÔ¨Åned as a threshold to ensure that Ri,n= 1 for theŒ∏\npoints closest to the nthpoint of the trajectory. In practice,\nwe expand this approach to both columns and rows of RP\nto include every possible repeated pattern in the smoothing\nprocess as:\nRi,j=H(/epsilon1(n)‚àíSi,n)‚à®H(/epsilon1(n)‚àíSn,j) (7)\n653Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nij1234567891010987654321\n(a)Wi,j\ni4567891010987654321\nnew chroma vectors (b)Wi,j\nFigure 3 . Reconstruction process: (a) overlapped chroma\nsegments (white boxes), (b) chroma summation over over-\nlapped segments with weight values.\nwherei,j,n‚àà[1,N]. Finally, a weight matrix Wi,jcan be\ncalculated using information from Si,jandRi,jas:\nWi,j= (1‚àíSi,j)¬∑Ri,j (8)\nHence, the matrix is sparse and has real values indicating\nthe similarity degrees of repeated sections. Figure 2 shows\nexamples of a similarity matrix Si,j, a recurrence plot Ri,j\nand a weight matrix Wi,jwhereM= 25 ,œÑ= 1andŒ∏= 50 .\nIn this paper, we Ô¨Åx œÑ= 1(i.e. no skipping frames).\n2.4 Feature Reconstruction\nEach column (or row) of Wi,jcontains information about re-\ncurrences of the current event across the whole song. More\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, the ithactivated component (i.e. non-zero com-\nponents) in the jthcolumn vector indicates that the ithseg-\nment is similar to the jthsegment. For example, the Ô¨Årst\ncolumn of Figure 3(a) shows that the 5thand 8thsegments\nare similar to the Ô¨Årst segment. For M= 3 andN= 10 ,\nFigure 3(a) depicts the temporal validity of chroma vector\nM-grams.\nTo generate the Ô¨Årst smoothed chroma vector from the\nexample in Figure 3(a), the activated weights at i={1,5,8}\nof the Ô¨Årst column are multiplied with the Ô¨Årst frames of the\ncorresponding segments. Then the results are summed up\nin the Ô¨Årst smoothed chroma vector (see the left most down\narrow in Figure 3(b)). Similarly, the second frame of the\nsmoothed chromagram uses the weights on the second col-\numn and the Ô¨Årst frames of the corresponding chroma seg-\nments (i.e.i={2,6,9}). However, the overlapping means\nthat the second frames from the previous segments should\nalso be considered (see the second column in Figure 3(b)).\nMore generally, the nthframe of the smoothed chromagram\nis computed from the weights in the previous n‚àíM‚àí1\ncolumns.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY\nThe experiments are performed on 249 chord annotated songs.\nThe data set comprises 179 songs1from Christopher Harte‚Äôs\nBeatles dataset, 20 songs from Matthias Mauch‚Äôs Queen\ndataset and 50 pop songs from the RWC (Real World Com-\nputing) database manually annotated by music students at\nNYU. The evaluations are performed on 12 major, 12 minor\ntriads and a no-chord detection task. In the evaluation, audio\nframes where the RMS is under -57 dB are assumed to be\nno-chords.\nFor the pattern matching process, binary chord templates\nand multivariate Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are used.\nThe binary chord templates (for 12 major and 12 minor tri-\nads) are manually generated based on basic chord theory. In\na 12-dimensional binary chord template vector, each com-\nponent corresponding to a chord-tone is set to 1, and the\nother components are set to 0 (e.g. [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0] for a C Major triad, where the left to right order of\nthe vector components follows the chromatic scale from C).\nThe detected chord on one given frame is the one whose\ntemplate is closest to the chroma vector of the frame in an\nEuclidean sense. The pseudo-probabilities for applying the\nViterbi decoder are calculated by taking the reciprocal of the\nEuclidean distances.\nThe parameters of the multivariate GMMs are estimated\nfrom annotated training data using the EM algorithm. For\ntraining, the data is segmented based on the chord annota-\ntions and transposed to the C-based chord. The root-normal-\nized chord collection is used to train C-major and C-minor\nmodels that are then re-transposed to the remaining roots to\ndeÔ¨Åne the 22 models. In this paper, we use a mixture of 15\nGaussians with diagonal covariance matrices.\nFor the Viterbi decoder, the transition penalty œÅis ap-\nplied. The transition penalty adjusts the strength of the self-\ntransition probability relative to transitions between differ-\nent chords [4]. It is applied as follows:\nlog(ÀÜai,j) =/braceleftBigg\nlog(ai,j)‚àíœÅfori/negationslash=j\nlog(ai,j) fori=j(12)\nwhereA= [ai,j]is the original transition probability matrix\nandÀÜA= [ÀÜai,j]is the modiÔ¨Åed matrix with penalty œÅ.

For each iteration, one group is selected\nas a test set, and the remaining 9 groups are used for train-\ning. The chord recognition rate is calculated as follows:\nAccuracy =total duration of correct chords\ntotal duration of dataset√ó100% (13)\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTable 1 shows the average accuracies of the binary template\nmodel with a moving average Ô¨Ålter, a median Ô¨Ålter, our method,\nand their combinations with the Viterbi decoder. The results\nshow thatCRPyields better results than Cin every case.\nAlso they show that our method outperforms the use of con-\nventional Ô¨Ålters regardless of the types of features. Table 2\nshows the result of using GMMs with the different combi-\nnations of the Ô¨Ålters. Similar to the case of the binary tem-\nplate model, CRPperforms better than C, and our method\nmaintains its advantages against both a moving average Ô¨Ål-\nter and a median Ô¨Ålter. All differences between conventional\nmethods and our method are signiÔ¨Åcant in paired t-test at\np<0.01.\nOne notable difference between our method and the con-\nventional Ô¨Ålters is its compatibility with the Viterbi decoder.\nAs shown in both tables, unlike our method, the moving av-\nerage Ô¨Ålter has almost no impact on the overall performance\nwhen used in combination with the Viterbi decoder. This is\ndue to the blurred boundaries caused by the Ô¨Ålter, as seen in\nFigure 4(b).

For our goal, a sharp and narrow distribu-\ntion is ideal, since it means little deviation from the ground\ntruth. In the case of Figure 5(d), the number of frames used\nto generate a new frame is at least 50 ( Œ∏= 50 ). As shown\nin Figure 5(b), although the moving average Ô¨Ålter employs a\nrelatively small number of frames ( Œª= 14 ) for smoothing,\nit shows larger deviations than our method in Figure 5(d).\nAlthough the median Ô¨Ålter is much better at preserving\nsharp edges than the moving average Ô¨Ålter as shown in Fig-\nure 5(c), the results in Table 1 and Table 2 are not much bet-\nter than those of the moving average Ô¨Ålter. In the case of\nCRP, the median Ô¨Ålter shows about the same performance\nas the moving average Ô¨Ålter. The median Ô¨Ålter is efÔ¨Åcient\nat removing impulsive noise. However, in whitened fea-\nture space such as CRP, it has little inÔ¨Çuence on the per-\nformance, but rather may lead to appreciable loss in sig-\nnal details, because it uses only rank-order information of\nthe input data within the Ô¨Ålter window without consider-\ning its original temporal-order information. These charac-\nteristic errors of conventional Ô¨Ålters hurt the performance.\nIn the case of Figure 5(b), the accuracy rate is 72.2%, and\nfor Figure 5(c), the accuracy rate is 72.7% for CRPfea-\ntures (compared to 75.4% for Figure 5(a) and 76.4% for\nFigure 5(d)). On the contrary, since our method keeps de-\nviations low and also preserves Ô¨Åne details, it maximizes\nthe beneÔ¨Åts of both our method and the Viterbi decoder.5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we provided a feature smoothing method based\non repeated patterns. By applying recurrence plot theory,\nour method smoothes chroma features using information from\nharmonically-related frames from the whole sequence, as\nopposed to conventional smoothing where only a few ad-\njacent frames are used. We showed that this method con-\ntributes to performance improvement by preserving the ben-\neÔ¨Åt of a fast-frame-rate analysis (i.e. sensing precise chord\nboundaries) while alleviating its problems (i.e. noise and\ntransients). This advantage is maintained among different\ntypes of chroma features.\nIn our experiments, we applied the same parameters ( M\nandŒ∏) to all songs, despite the risk of over-smoothing. In\nthe future, we plan to develop adaptive methods for opti-\nmally choosing these parameters for each individual track.\nWe fully expect this adaptation to improve performance be-\nyond what is reported in this paper.\n6.

Experiments were conducted using songs from seven stylistically identi-fiable pop/rock bands, and the chords generated by the sys-tems were compared to the ones in the artists‚Äô original work. Evaluations were performed on multiple aspects, in-cluding calculating the average percentage of chords that were the same and those that were related, studying the manner in which the size of the training set affects the out-put harmonization, and examining a system‚Äôs behaviors in terms of the ability of generating unseen chords and the number of unique chords produced per song. We observed that the rule-based system performs comparably well while the result of the system with learning capability varies as the training set grows. 1. INTRODUCTION Automatic generation of harmony is a natural extension and application of harmonic analysis, an essential component in music information retrieval. Previous research in automatic harmonization focuses on Western classical music, apply-ing various techniques ranging from rule-based models [4] to genetic algorithms [10] in order to automate the process of harmonization in styles. An example would be the four-part harmonization in the Baroque period.  Recently, sys-tems have been developed for automatic harmonization in popular music [3, 7, 9], i.e., creating a sequence of chords for a given melody representing the vocal part in a song. However, the concept of style is loosely defined or even missing in most of these systems. As the Beatles represents a firmly defining role in pop/rock music, the style of the individual artist must be considered.  In this paper we compare three different approaches for style-specific harmonization in popular music. The three approaches demonstrate a wide spectrum of techniques: a knowledge-driven model, a data-driven model, and a hybrid system combining the two. We conducted experiments by taking the melody of songs from seven identifiable pop/rock bands as the input for the three systems, and com-pared the system-generated chords with the ones in the original artists‚Äô work. For systems with learning capabili-ties, we analyzed the relationship between the size of the training set and the quality of the output harmonization. We also examined the characteristics of each system in terms of the number of unique chords it generates for each song, and its ability to produce chords that are not included in training sets. 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION Suppose a melody consists of m monophonic notes, {a1, ‚Ä¶, am}, harmonized by a sequence of n chords {C1, ‚Ä¶, Cn}, 1‚â§n‚â§m. The melody can also be represented as a set of n melody segments, {M1, ‚Ä¶, Mn}, and each of the seg-ments contains notes harmonized by a particular chord. For example, the melody segment Mi, harmonized by the chord Ci, can be represented as: Mi = {1)||(11+‚àë‚àí=ijMja,‚Ä¶, ||)||(11MiMjija+‚àë‚àí=},                           (1) where |Mj| is the number of notes in the melody segment Mj. The location of a chord often aligns with the bar line between two measures, but not necessarily, as more than one chord may appear in a bar. Chords for two adjacent melody segments may be identical or different.  In order to generate chords for a given melody, the har-monization task requires two steps: segmenting the melody into melody segments and selecting a chord for each melo-dy segment. In this paper we focus on the second step, chord selection, and assume the information about segmen-tation is given. Each chord Ci is selected among 24 candi-dates, 12 major triads and 12 minor ones.

And the choice of triads is also be-cause of our intention to focus on the fundamental chords. 3. SYSTEMS 3.1 The Rule-Based Harmonic Analyzer The Harmonic Analyzer [11] (HA) proposed by Temperley and Sleator applies preference rules to rhythm analysis and harmonization in the Western classical music tradition. To harmonize a melody, the system first divides it into seg-ments, and then assigns the root of the chord for each seg-ment, without indicating the mode (major or minor). For the purpose of this paper, we focus on the process of root finding. The system operates on the application of the four Harmonic Preference Rules (HPR): HPR 1 (Compatibility Rule): prefer certain TPC (tonal pitch-class)-root relations over others, in the following or-der: ,1ÀÜ,5ÀÜ,3ÀÜ,3ÀÜb,7ÀÜb,5ÀÜb,9ÀÜbornamental; HPR 2 (Strong Beat Rule): prefer chord-spans that start on strong beats of the meter; HPR 3 (Harmonic Variance Rule): prefer roots that are close to the roots of nearby segments on the line of fifths; HPR 4 (Ornamental Dissonance Rule): prefer ornamental dissonances that are (a) closely followed by an event a step or half-step away in pitch height, and (b) metrically weak. Given a melody segment, a score is calculated for each of the possible 12 roots as a weighted sum using the four preference rules. The compatibility rule (HPR 1) assigns a score to each note in the melody segment depending on the relationship of the note to the root. If the note is the tonic (1ÀÜ) of the root, it receives the highest score. Notes that are not listed in the compatibility rule are given penalties, de-pending on the inter-onset interval between the note to the next note a step or half-step apart in pitch and the note‚Äôs metrical strength (HPR 4). Whenever a new root is selected for a segment, i.e., a chosen root is different from the one in the previous segment, it receives a penalty based on the strength of the beat where the new root starts. If the new root starts at a strong beat, it will receive a lower penalty (HPR 2). To apply the harmonic variance rule (HPR 3), a center of gravity is calculated as the average position of roots in all previous segments on the line of fifths, weighted by the length and how recent the segments are. The current root is then assigned a penalty based on its distance to the center of gravity. The scores calculated on HPR1 and HPR 3 are further weighted by the length of the segment. Finally, a dynamic programming algorithm is applied to retrieve the path of roots that report the highest overall score. We used the implementation of the system provided by Temperley and Sleator [12] for comparison in this paper. We converted melodies in the MIDI format to text files containing a sequence of note events with beat structures as the required input for the HA system. In order to make the output of the HA system comparable to the ones from other systems, we expanded the output root into a major or a mi-nor triad. We interpreted the chords as being the common ones as described in the textbook for Music Theory [6]. The common chords, written in Roman Numerals, include I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii. For example, when a root G is report-ed by the HA system in a song in the key of C major, we assign a G major (V) instead of a G minor (v) chord. For a root not listed as either major or minor in the set of com-mon chords, we randomly assign a mode to the root. 3.2 Hidden Markov Models Statistical approaches, particularly Markov Models, have been commonly utilized for harmonic analysis and genera-tion in Western classical music [1, 5]. More recently, My-Song [9] uses HMMs to automatically choose chords to ac-company a vocal melody. Five categories of triads are con-sidered in the MySong system, including major, minor, augmented, diminished and suspended triads. Chords are represented as their functional roles in relation to the key, which is given along with each song. The system models two types of relations: the co-occurrence of a chord and the distribution of pitches in the melody segment, and the co-occurrence of two chords observed adjacently. Two proba-bility matrices are constructed to record the statistical in-formation about the two relations. The first matrix, melody observation matrix, records duration-weighted melodic pitch class histogram observed in training examples for all the chords in consideration. The second matrix, chord tran-sition matrix, shows the logarithmic likelihood of the tran-sition from one chord to another observed in the training examples. To generate chords for an input melody, a pitch class histogram is first produced for each melody segment as the observed state, and the likelihood of a chord chosen for that melody segment is calculated using melody obser-vation matrix. Combining the resulting logarithmic likeli-hood with chord transition probabilities, the Viterbi algo-rithm is then applied to retrieve the most likely possible chord sequence for the entire melody.   The main design goal of MySong is different from the topic concerned in this paper. The system was trained on hundreds of songs by various artists across many genres at once, without concentrating on any particular style. The fi-nal chord sequence was controlled by users through the ad-\n22212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   justment of two options: ‚Äúhappy factor‚Äù generates more ma-jor triads, while ‚Äújazz factor‚Äù assigns more weights on the melody observation matrix than on the chord transition ma-trix. Regardless of the different design goal, the underlying HMMs in MySong can be easily adapted to the generation of style-specific harmonization with proper modifications. Inspired by MySong, we implemented a HMM-based mod-el for style-specific harmonization. We maintained the two matrices and the way they were calculated, and also applied the Viterbi algorithm to retrieve the final chord sequence. However, we discarded the two user options with the result that the generated chord sequence completely depends on the statistical information observed in the training exam-ples. We also limited chord selection to among major and minor triads only, resulting in a 24-by-12 melody observa-tion matrix and a 12-by-12 chord transition matrix. Infor-mation such as melody segment and key is given. During the process of training, only songs written by one artist or band are supplied.    It is important to discuss the differences between the rule-based HA system and the HMM approach. In addition to the basic musical terms such as pitch, pitch class, chord and key that exist in both systems, the HA system has em-bedded more knowledge of abstract musical structures, in-cluding scale, rhythmic hierarchy, ornamental and circle-of-fifths. The functional role of each melody note and that of each chord in relation to the hierarchical and abstract struc-ture of the song are well defined in the HA system as pref-erence rules. To generate harmonization for a given melo-dy, chords are selected by a series of calculations using pre-defined scores and penalties. In contrast, none of these ab-stract structures are considered in the HMM approach. Only two relations are modeled in the HMM system: pitch class distribution in melody for each segment (the observed state) and transitions between adjacent chords (transitions be-tween states). The preference of such relations in HMM is completely determined by the training examples without using any pre-set scores or penalties. 3.3 Automatic Style-Specific Accompaniment System In [3], Chuan and Chew proposed an Automatic Style-Specific Accompaniment (ASSA) system that generates accompaniments in a particular style to a melody given on-ly a few training examples. The system takes a hybrid ap-proach, applying statistical learning on top of a music theo-retic framework. In ASSA, the relation between melodic notes and chordal harmonies is modelled as a binary classi-fication task called chord tone determination: if the note is part of the chord structure, then the note is classified as a chord tone; otherwise it is labelled a non-chord tone. Each melody note is represented using 73 attributes, including pitch, duration, metrical strength, its relation to the neigh-bouring tones, phrase location, etc. These attributes de-scribe the functional role of each melody note in the various abstract musical structures of the song. However, unlike the HA system, the preference or suitability of a certain type of note or chord is not pre-programmed into the system; it is learned from the training examples. Therefore, the resulting classifier, a trained decision tree in ASSA, is completely determined by the style shared in common by the training songs.   Instead of representing chord transitions as pairs (source chord and destination chord) as in the HMM approach, the ASSA system applies neo-Riemannian transforms [2] to focus on the musical relationship between the two chords involved in the transition and the movements of pitches from one chord to another. For example, a transition from a C major triad to an E minor triad is described using the leading tone exchange (L) operation1 because the two triads share the pitches e and g, but the pitch c in C major is re-placed by the E minor‚Äôs pitch b, which is the leading tone in C major. The transition from F major triad to A minor triad is also described using the same L operation, while such transition is recognized as a different chord pair (C major, E minor) in the HMM approach. Chord transitions in the ASSA system are represented in a manner that reflects their relation on the circle-of-fifths and voice leading be-tween the chord tones. But unlike the HA system, which always prefers the movement in the shortest distance on the circle-of-fifths, the applicability of the transition type is de-termined by the training examples.   Another difference between ASSA and the previous two systems can be observed in the generation of the final chord sequence for harmonization. ASSA generates harmoniza-tion in a divide-and-conquer fashion. The system first di-vides the input melody into sub-phrases delineated by bars in which melody notes strongly imply triads; then it gener-ates a sequence of chords for each sub-phrase independent-ly. For each sub-phrase, a Markov model is used to calcu-late probabilities of all possible chord series. Given a series of n chords, {C1, ‚Ä¶, Cn}, where each chord is indexed by its segment number, the probability that this chord series occurs can be expressed as: ),...|,...(11nnSSCCP ),,|()...,,|()|(11211211nnnnSSCCPSSCCPSCP‚àí‚àí= ),,|,()...,|()|(11212,111nnnnSSNROPSSNROPSCP‚àí‚àí=  (2)                                                              1 The four fundamental operations in neo-Riemannian transforms are I (Identify), L (Leading-tone exchange), P (Parallel) and R (Relative). \n223Poster Session 2\n   where NROi-1, i is the neo-Riemannian operation between chord Ci-1 and Ci, and Si is the phrase position of segment i, which falls into one of four possible categories: start, mid-dle, ending and final. These sub-phrases of chords are at last combined, with refinements, to produce the chord pro-gression for the entire melody.  4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 4.1 Experiments The objective of the paper is to examine the effectiveness of the three approaches ‚Äì a rule-based system, a statistical model and a hybrid system ‚Äì for the automatic generation of style-specific harmonization. We used 140 songs by sev-en stylistically distinct pop/rock bands, including the Beat-les (B), Bon Jovi (BJ), Green Day (GD), Guns N‚Äô Roses (GR), Indigo Girls (I), Keane (K) and Radiohead (R). Songs by the same band are considered to have similar styles. We obtained information about each song such as melody, chord and key from the commercial lead sheet. Melodies were encoded in the MIDI format while chords and keys were written in text files with melody segments specified.   For systems with learning abilities, we conducted the Leave-One-Out test. We selected one song as the test song and formed a training set using the remaining songs by the same artist. We then compared the generated chords with the ones given in the commercial lead sheet (the ground truth) of the test song. To examine the manner in which the number of training examples affects the performance of the systems, we constructed training sets with various sizes by gradually adding one song into the set. Suppose we have m songs by an artist and n represents the number of songs in the training set, 1‚â§ n ‚â§ m-1. For each test song, we can con-struct 1‚àímnCdifferent training sets. Therefore, for each n, we will have results from m x1‚àímnCdifferent test instances. The number of test instances grows quickly and becomes infea-sible as m and n increase. For example, if we have 20 songs by an artist and we form test sets of 10 songs, the resulting number of test instances is 20 x 1910C = 1847560. We lim-ited the number of training sets by randomly choosing 120 training sets for each test song if the total number of possi-ble training sets exceeds 120. Therefore, for each n, the number of test instances is bounded by 120 x m. On the other hand, for the rule-based HA system that does not re-quire training examples, the total number of test instances for an artist is equivalent to m.      4.2 Results 4.2.1 Same Chord Percentage Figure 1 shows the average percentage of generated chords that are identical to the ones in the ground truth with 95% confidence interval. Notice that the ASSA system reports a higher same chord percentage when the number of training songs increases. But the same chord percentage of HMM decreases as the increment of training songs increases in all cases except the one shown in Figure 1 (b). In general, ASSA reports higher or at least equivalent same chord per-centage as HMM. However, comparing with ASSA and HMM, it is difficult to make general comments on the re-sult of rule-based HA (the one with zero training songs) be-cause of its wide confidence interval.  \n Figure 1. Same chord percentage with different sizes of training sets. 4.2.2 Related Chord Percentage Figure 2 shows the average percentage of generated chords that are closely related to the ground truth. Two chords are considered closely related if they show one of the following relations: identical, dominant, subdominant, relative, paral-lel, dominant/relative, dominant/parallel, subdomi-nant/relative and subdominant/parallel. For example, if the ground truth is C major, the closely related chords in the order are C major, G major, F major, A minor, C minor, E minor, G minor, D minor and F minor. When related chord \n22412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   percentage is considered, the rule-based HA performs the best in general. HMM and ASSA perform similarly, but as the number of training songs increases, the results for ASSA improves while those for HMM decline. \n Figure 2. Related chord percentage with different sizes of training sets. 4.2.3 Average Number of Unique Chords We also examine the number of unique chords generated for each song by the three systems, and compare that with the number of unique chords in each band‚Äôs original songs. Each unique chord chosen by a composer is analogous to a color used by a painter, and the number of colors that ap-pear in a painting is usually considered a contributing factor of a painting style. The number of unique chords equals the total number of chords in the sequence subtract the number of duplicate chords. Figure 3 shows the average number of unique chords generated by the three systems and in the original songs. Notice that the average number of unique chords generated by the rule-based HA system is the closest to but slightly lower than the ground truth (GT). The num-ber of unique chords generated by HMM grows as the number of training examples increases, which provides more chords as cases for HMM to learn from. In contrast, the number of unique chords generated by ASSA drops and becomes closer to the ground truth when the number of training examples increases. This may result from the use of the neo-Riemannian transform, which only represents the relative relation in the transition between chords, allowing more freedom to choose chord pairs that are not included in the training set as long as they share the same transition. \n Figure 3. Average number of unique chords per song using HMM, ASSA, HA and in the ground truth (GT). 4.2.4 Average Number of New Chords For systems that require training examples, it is important to study how these examples affect the output. Particularly, we are interested in the system‚Äôs ability to generate chords that are not given in the training examples. For comparison, we also investigate the original songs to observe the num-ber of chords in a song that do not appear in a given set of other songs by the same artist. We label these unseen chords as new chords.  Figure 4 presents the average number of new chords generated by HMM and ASSA, and in the original accom-paniment, the GT. In the original accompaniments, when the training set is small, there are always one or two new chords in each song. As the training set grows, the training examples gradually cover all the chords in each song. In ASSA, because of the neo-Riemannian framework, it demonstrates the ability to create new chords but tends to generate too many when the training examples are too few. More training examples help ASSA become stable. On the other hand, the output chords of HMM are fully limited by the chords given in the training examples.  \n225Poster Session 2\n   \n Figure 4. Average number of new chords per song using HMM, ASSA, HA and in the ground truth (GT). 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we compared three different approaches, a rule-based model, a statistical model, and a hybrid system combining the two, for automatic style-specific harmoniza-tion in popular music. We conducted experiments by using songs from several stylistically identifiable pop/rock bands, having the systems generate chords to harmonize given melodies, and compared the generated chords with the orig-inal. We observed that the rule-based system generates the most chords within a close range of the original. As the number of training examples increases, the hybrid system reports more chords identical to the original than the other systems. Although the hybrid system has the ability to gen-erate chords that were not present in the training set, it tends to produce too many types of chords for a given song. The HMM-based system, however, produces fewer and fewer chords that are similar to the original as the size of the training set grows. In the future we plan to study differ-ent approaches for dividing melodies into melody segments for the harmonization task. We also plan to explore other methods for evaluating system-generated harmonization in a particular style. Besides comparing the generated chords with the original, we will investigate means for measuring the tension and relaxation created in the harmonization.  6. REFERENCES [1] M. Allan, C. K. I.

INTRODUCTION\nContext and motivation. NEUMA is a Digital Score Li-\nbrary devoted to the publication of digital music scores. Putting\nthis material on-line offers an opportunity for web-based\nsharing of musical scores archives, including collaborative\nproduction, annotation, and large-scale corpus analysis. In\nthe present paper, we focus on the functionalities that per-\nmit to undertake large-scale studies of melodic, harmonic\nor stylistic material. One of the musical investigations cur-\nrently conducted by our fellow musicologists working with\nNEUMA considers a melodic r¬¥epertoire in a given cultural\narea, and studies how this r ¬¥epertoire is exchanged and bor-\nrowed throughout various styles, periods and composers.\nUsing efÔ¨Åcient tools to retrieve and compare similar melodies\nleverages the scope of investigations that can be conducted\nfor such a study. To this end, N EUMA provides a set of\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.functions that support the analysis process. The pattern-\nmatching function takes a pattern Pand carries out a search\nover the score collections, looking for allthe melodic frag-\nments that ‚Äúmatch‚Äù P. The function can be parameterized\nby combining one of the following options: Exact search ,\nwhich can itself be reÔ¨Åned as Transposed/non transposed\nand/or With/without rhythm , and Approximate search , which\ncomparesPto melodic fragments considered in their full\ndimensions (pitch, rhythm) and applies a similarity func-\ntion. The user is free to choose an appropriate combination\nof these choices (called an interpretation in the following),\nand this yields a quite appreciated Ô¨Çexibility to the system.\nThis Ô¨Çexibility has a cost, though, since the system must be\nready to face several possible pattern interpretations.\nIndexing the pattern-matching retrieval process. As our\ncollections grow, the need for an indexing mechanism able\nto directly access the scores of interest for a given pattern\nbecame prominent. Building an index for each possible in-\nterpretation would have been cumbersome due to the major\nredundancy of information in the associated descriptors. We\nrather chose to design a specialized index, able to satisfy\nseveral interpretations. This design, and the experiments\nthat validate the resulting structure, constitute the purpose\nof the present paper.\nIn short, the principles of our index, called Melodic Sig-\nnature Index (MSI), can be summarized as follows: (i) its\nkernel structure is that of a traditional hash Ô¨Åle , with an in-\nmemory directory that refers to a list of on-disk buckets ; (ii)\neach entryein the directory corresponds to the hash value\nheof some Ô¨Åxed-size melodic fragments, called n-grams,\npresent in at least one score of the collections; the associ-\nated bucket actually contains the list of allthen-gram occur-\nrences that hash to he; (iii) the index implementation is con-\nsistently built over algebraic signatures computed from the\nmelodicn-grams, and representing the various aspects that\nmight be addressed by one of the possible pattern-matching\ninterpretations.\n363Poster Session 3\nWhereas the Ô¨Årst two aspects are drawn from the state-\nof-the-art in terms of large text-encoded indexing [14], the\nlast one is inspired by recent work on signature-based text\nprocessing [7, 10], tailored to the speciÔ¨Åcs of symbolic mu-\nsic retrieval. The resulting structure enjoys several features\nthat make it a suitable choice for large score libraries index-\ning, namely (i) Ô¨Çexibility ‚Äì a single index supports several\ndistinct pattern-matching operations, (ii) compactness ‚Äì in\nspite of the rich information content it contains, the index\nspace requirement is only a fragment of the overall collec-\ntion storage, and (iii) efÔ¨Åciency ‚Äì as shown by our analytic\nstudy and experiments, a few milliseconds sufÔ¨Åce to retrieve\nthe result, even for very large patterns searched for in very\nlarge collections.\nRelated work. Two main approaches for off-line indexing\nscore collections have been investigated: tree-based [9, 13,\n20] and inverted Ô¨Åles [3,5,16]. [5,16] propose to index both\nthe pitch interval and rhythm sequences in an inverted Ô¨Åle.\nWe adopt a similar approach, with a much richer encoding\nthat allows to reach a constant search complexity and more\nÔ¨Çexibility in terms of search options.\nThe subjective nature of measuring music similarity lead\nto the introduction of several error measures. The Œ¥and\n(Œ¥,Œ±) approximations [2] use exact matching algorithms for\nsimilarity search. Many algorithms for efÔ¨Åcient computa-\ntion of similarity matching through exhaustive search have\nbeen proposed [1, 4]. In general, indexing can be achieved\nwith a high-dimensional structure whose performances are\nknown to deteriorate as the dimension increases. In the spe-\nciÔ¨Åc context of the edit distance, several indexing methods\nhave been suggested, an overview of which can be found\nin [15]. A classical technique is to introduce an measure ap-\nproximating the edit distance but easier to index [12]. The\nidea of using n-gram for melody retrieval and measuring\nmusic similarity is not new in monophonic [17,19] as well as\npolyphonic pieces [6, 8], although they usually model only\nsome of the music information. Our structure enjoys the\nnice feature of being able to index both exact search with\nmany variants, and approximate search based on the edit\ndistance. This makes it a structure of choice to solve the\naddressed problem of index pattern searches in large score\ndatabases.\nThe rest of the paper presents our structure (Section 2)\nand the pattern-matching algorithms (Section 3). Section 4\nbrieÔ¨Çy reports the performance results obtained over a large\ncollection of scores, and Section 5 concludes the paper.\n2. THE MELODIC SIGNATURE INDEX\nWe outline in this section the index structure in N EUMA ,\nwith emphasis on algebraic information put in index records.2.1 Index overview\nNEUMA interprets scores content according to a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù of\nsymbolic music. The model of interest to this work relies\non a synchronized time series approach that sees a score as\na superposition of voices . Each voice is a sequence of ele-\nments inE√óD , whereEis the domain of musical ‚Äúevents‚Äù\n(notes, chords, rest, etc.) and Dthe musical duration. A de-\nscriptor can be text-encoded in the form <e1-d1; e 2-d2;\n...; en-dn>where each e iencodes an event and each d i\nits duration. In the following, we shall blur the distinction\nbetween a descriptor and its textual encoding. Given a de-\nscriptord, we denote as /epsilon1(d)the sequence of events (without\ndurations) and as œÅ(d)the sequence of durations (without\nevents) ofd.\nExample 1 Voicev, in score 354, encodes a melody begin-\nning with a G3 (half), followed by an A3 (half), a B3 (Ô¨Çat,\nquarter), etc. Its descriptor dvis: (22-2;24-2;25-4;24-4;22-\n4;21-4;22-4;. . . ) Moreover, /epsilon1(dv)= (22, 24, 25, 24, 22, 21,\n22, . . . ) and œÅ(dv)=(2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, . . . ).\nIn the example above, note heights are encoded with chro-\nmatic notation (number of semi-tones from the lowest pos-\nsible sound). Rest, chords, and silence are encoded with\nother, non ambiguous, symbols: we do not elaborate fur-\ntherEwhich provides a compact representation of melodic\nsequences.\nGiven a pattern P, a search retrieves the scores such that\nforat least a voicev, and at least an offset (position) oin\nv,Pmatches the fragment v[o]v[o+ 1].... The seman-\ntics of a matching attempt depends on the interpretation of\nP, chosen by the user at query time. We explain the pro-\ncess with an example: let Pbe the pattern described by\n37-4;35-4;34-2 . Then, under the exact search, trans-\nposed, without rhythm interpretation, Pmatches the voice\nvof Example 1 at offset 3 (offsets start at 0). If we take\nthe rhythm into account, this is no longer true. Using a non-\ntransposed interpretation also leads to a failure, with or with-\nout rhythm. Finally, an approximate search likely detects a\nhigh similarity between Pandvat position 3.\n2.2 Algebraic signatures\nWe interpret our melodic events in Eas elements of a Galois\nÔ¨ÅeldGF(2f)of size 2f. The elements of GFare bit strings\nof lengthf. Since|E|‚â§ 255, we letf= 8in the following.\nA Galois Ô¨Åeld is a Ô¨Ånite set that supports addition and mul-\ntiplication. These operations are associative, commutative\nand distributive, have neutral elements 0and1, and there ex-\nist additive and multiplicative inverses. A primitive element\nŒ±ofGFis such that its powers enumerate all the non-zero\nelements of the Galois Ô¨Åeld. Let D=e0e1¬∑¬∑¬∑eM‚àí1be a\ndescriptor encoding a sequence of Mevents interpreted as\nGF elements. We deÔ¨Åne an AS signature as follows.\n36412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nDeÔ¨Ånition 1 TheASŒ±-signature of a descriptor Dis de-\nÔ¨Åned by\nASŒ±(D) =e0+e1¬∑Œ±+e2¬∑Œ±2...+eM‚àí1¬∑Œ±M‚àí1(1)\nIf we consider mprimitive elements Œ±1,Œ±2,...,Œ±m, the\nm-symbols signature NASm(D)is obtained by concatenat-\ning the set of ASŒ±i(D),1‚â§i‚â§m, seen as bit strings. This\nallows to obtain a signature of size m.\nGiven a descriptor D, we are interested in partial alge-\nbraic signatures calculated from substrings of D.\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2 Letl‚àà[0,M‚àí1]be any offset inD. The\nCumulative Algebraic Signature (CAS) atl,CAS (D,l), is\nthe algebraic signature of the preÔ¨Åx of Dending atel, i.e.,\nCAS (D,l) =AS(e0...el).\nThePartial Algebraic Signature (PAS) from l/primetolis the\nvaluePAS (D,l/prime,l) =AS(el/primeel/prime+1¬∑¬∑¬∑el), with 0‚â§l/prime‚â§l,\nWe most often use the PAS of sub-sequences of length n,\ni.e., ofn-grams.\nDeÔ¨Ånition 3 Then-gram Algebraic Signature (NAS) of D\natlisNAS (D,l) =PAS (D,l‚àín+ 1,l), forl‚â•n‚àí1.\nelel‚àín+1el‚Äôe0eM‚àí1CAS(l) PAS(l‚Äô, l) NAS(l)\nDescriptor D\nFigure 1 .CAS (l),PAS (l/prime,l)andNAS (l)in descriptor D\nWe may drop Dwhenever it is implicit for brevity‚Äôs sake.\nFigure 1 shows the respective parts of the record that deÔ¨Åne\ntheCAS ,PAS andNAS at offsetl. The following simple\nproperties of algebraic signatures are useful for what fol-\nlows. Properties 2 and 3 let us incrementally calculate next\nCAS and NAS while indexing the score, or preprocessing\nthe pattern, instead of recomputing the signature entirely.\nThis speeds up the process considerably.\nCAS (l) =CAS (l‚àí1) +el¬∑Œ±l(2)\nNAS (l) =NAS (l‚àí1)‚àíel‚àín\nŒ±+el¬∑Œ±n‚àí1(3)\nProperty 4 Ô¨Ånally is fundamental for the match attempt\ncalculus.

The above are\nsufÔ¨Åcient to describe the MS-index features.2.3 The Melodic Signature index\nThe Melodic Signature Index (MS-Index) is a classical hash\nÔ¨Åle, denoted HD[ 0..L‚àí1], with directory length L= 2v\nbeing a power of 2 (Figure 2). Elements of HD refer to\nbuckets or lines of variable length.\nBucketsrecords for CAS c\nr2 <i1,o1,c1,c‚Äô1,A1,u1>\nL‚àí10\nCC0\niHash directory HDr1\nrecords for CAS c‚ÄôStructure of a bucket\n... <ik,ok,ck,c‚Äôk,Ak,uk><i2,o2,c2,c‚Äô2,A2,u2>\n...\nFigure 2 . Structure of the MS-Index\n.\nEach bucket stores a list of hash records (records in short),\neach indexing some Ô¨Åxed-size fragment of a voice descrip-\ntor, calledn-gram. Fragment (24-4;22-4;21-4) is for in-\nstance a 3-gram extracted from the descriptor of Example 1.\nThe actual value of nis a parameter of the MS-Index, to\nbe discussed next. To build the index, we process all n-\ngrams in the score library. From each n-gramGof the form\ne1-d1;...;en-dnwe derive a number of algebraic sig-\nnatures that determine the index organization and content.\nWe Ô¨Årst use signatures to calculate the index iof the line\nthat refers to G. LetœÑbe the transform that extracts from\nGa (n-1)-gram with the sequence of pitch intervals. We\ncalculateiby hashing on the intervals signature. Let s=\nNASm(/epsilon1(G))be them-symbol signature of Gfor some\nm(see below), interpreted as a large, unsigned integer and\ncompute index ias:\ni=hL(S) =SmodL\nSinceL= 2v, this amounts to extracting the last vbits of\nS.mshould be such that m‚â§nandm‚â•‚åàv/f‚åâ.\nExample 2 LetGbe the 4-gram (24-4;22-4;21-4;22-4). Then\n/epsilon1(G)=(24, 22, 21, 22) and œÑ(/epsilon1(G))=(-2, -1, 1) (e.g., the\npitch interval encoding). Assume m= 3. We select three\nindependent primitive elements Œ±1,Œ±2, andŒ±3in the Ga-\nlois Field. The index of Gin the hash Ô¨Åle is:\nASŒ±1(œÑ).ASŒ±2(œÑ).ASŒ±3(œÑ) modL\nwhere.represents bit string concatenation.\nThe properties of AS signatures ensure a balanced distri-\nbution of the hash values in the range [0..L‚àí1]. Next, we\ninsert in HD [i]arecord describingG, deÔ¨Åned as follows:\n365Poster Session 3\nDeÔ¨Ånition 4 LetGbe ann-gram at offset oin a descrip-\ntorD. The record indexingG, denotedR(G), is a 6-uplet\n(id(D),o,c/epsilon1,cœÅ,ASœÅ,‚ä•)where\n1.c/epsilon1isCAS (/epsilon1(D),o), i.e., the event CAS ofGato;\n2.cœÅisCAS (œÅ(D),o), i.e., the rhythm CAS ofGato;\n3.ASœÅisNASm(œÅ(D),o), i.e., its rhythm signature;\n4.‚ä•is the minimal pitch index in G, representing (along\nwith the previous signatures) its absolute height.\nThe hash record of an n-gram contains all the informa-\ntion necessary to evaluate matching attempts at run time, by\ncombining the signatures with the Galois Field operators to\nevaluate the required pattern interpretation.\nExample 3 Consider again the 4-gram Gof Example 2, as-\nsuming it is found at offset 3. Then c/epsilon1andcœÅare obtained\nfrom the cumulative values at offset o‚àí1, thanks to Prop-\nerty 2;AœÅis theNAS signature of œÅ(G)=(4, 4, 4, 4);‚ä•is\n21, the minimal pitch of the n-gram.\nConstruction time complexity. The MS-index is built in lin-\near time in the size of the score library. Note in particular\nthat the cumulative signature at offset ocan be derived from\nthe cumulative at offset o‚àí1.\nSpace complexity. The size of the directory, HD, is neg-\nligible. Given a descriptor D, a record occupies 3 + 2 +\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 bytes, and the index size is therefore\n|L|√óœÑD√ó9, whereœÑDdenotes the ratio of descriptor‚Äôs\nsize with respect to a full score size. Standard indexed Ô¨Åle\ncompression techniques (e.g., variable bytes compression)\nfurther reduce the space requirements. As shown by our ex-\nperiments,œÑDis typically of the order of 10/00and, in spite\nof its rich content, our index occupies a small fraction of the\nwhole library space.\n3. SCORE RETRIEV AL\nDue to space limitation, we give in this section an informal\npresentation of the algorithms.\n3.1 Exact search, basic algorithm\nWe explain (Figure 3) an exact search, transposed and with-\nout rhythm (that is, we consider as a match any sequence\nof pitch intervals similar to that of P). First, we preprocess\nPfor three signatures: (i) of the initial n-gramS1, (ii) of\nthe Ô¨Ånaln-gramS2and (iii) of the sufÔ¨Åx SpofPafterS1.\nHashing onS1locates the bucket with every record r1hash-\ning to the signature of S1. Likewise, hashing on S2locates\nthe bucket with every r2hashing to the signature of S2. We\nonly consider pairs of records that are in the same voice and\nat the right distance among them (looking at offsets). We\nfailure\nPattern PS1Sp\nS2h(S1)\nh(S2)\nHash directorye1\ne2AS(e1, e2, Sp)\nsuccessFigure 3 .

An algebraic calcu-\nlationAS(r1,r2,Sp), based on the cumulative signatures,\ndetermines whether Spmay match the sufÔ¨Åx of Das well.\nSearch complexity. By limiting disk accesses to the two\nbuckets associated to the Ô¨Årst and last n-grams of the P,\nMS-Index search runs independently from P‚Äôs size. The\ncost of the search procedure outlined above is reduced to\nthat of reading two buckets. The hash directory is cached\nin RAM. With an appropriate dynamic hashing mechanism\nthat evenly distributes the records in the structure and scales\ngracefully, the bucket size is expected to remain uniform\nenough to let the MS-Index run in constant time.\n3.2 Exact search, other interpretations\nOther interpretations than the basic one are obtained with\nstraightforward extensions to the above algorithm, namely\n1) non-transposed search, without rhythm, is obtained by\ncomparing the minimal pitch index of P‚Äôs initialn-gram\nand the value‚ä•ofr1; 2) searching with rhythm implies\na calculus similar to that on intervals, using r1.cœÅ,r2.cœÅand\nAœÅas input ; 3) any combination of these criteria is possible\nto achieve the required interpretation.\nThe cost analysis remains similar, since the signatures\ncomparison is negligible regarding that of buckets access.\n3.3 Approximate search\nOur index supports the similarity measure using n-grams\nintroduced by Ukkonen [18]. The more n-grams the two\nstrings have in common, the higher the similarity. The n‚àígram\nproÔ¨Åle is a vectorGPsuch thatGP[S]is the number of oc-\ncurrences of the n-gramSinP. The ‚Äúdistance‚Äù between\ntwo stringsPandQis then:\nAn(P,Q) = Œ£v‚ààŒ£n|GP[v]‚àíGQ[v]|,\nwhere Œ£nis the set of all possible n‚àígrams.\n36612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncollection1# Ô¨Åles Ô¨Åles size # desc. desc. size\nbach 280 27.1 MB 1,243 539 KB\ngut 137 197.2 MB 352 2,413 KB\nhausmusik 452 140.9 MB 1,218 1,944 KB\nhymns 1,752 84.6 MB 3,885 1,954 KB\nmusicxml 405 38.9 MB 1,738 713 KB\nwikifonia 3,583 302.7 MB 3,570 2,787 KB\nwima 961 427.3 MB 3,110 4,624 KB\nmisc 94 8.9 MB 101 89 KB\nall 7,664 1,227.6 MB 15,517 15,063 KB\nTable 1 .

We repeat this process for all offsets of the list\nby sliding the window along the list. We return all triplets\n(istart,iend,di)which comply to the maximum error toler-\nance.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\nWe built a library of MusicXML scores collected from sev-\neral public on-line collections, reported in Table 1. There\nexists an important discrepancy in the size of the descrip-\ntors. The average descriptor size is 967 bytes, and it ranges\nfrom 444B on average in bach to 7,020B in gutenberg\n(noted gut). The ratio (descriptorsize/documentsize )\nvaries from 90/00inwikifonia to 230/00inhymns .\nTable 2 reports the building time and the size of the MS-\nIndex for different datasets. For bach ,gut andwima , we\nchoose 4-grams. The building time does not linearly in-\ncrease with the descriptors size.

This results from both the handling of hash collisions\nand variable-bytes compression (not detailed here).\nAs expected, the size of the index linearly depends on the\ndescriptors size. Finally using larger n-grams has a minor\nimpact on the index size, but an important one on the build-\ning time: e.g7-gram index requires 25% more space than\n3-gram index thanks to lower compression rate, but a build-\ning time 7 times higher, due to less collisions to handle and\nless compression to perform.\ncollection building time size\nbach 0.7 s 1.0 MB\ngut 3.3 s 5.1 MB\nwima 11.4 s 9.5 MB\nall (3-gram) 206.6 s 28.5 MB\nall (4-gram) 82.6 s 29.7 MB\nall (5-gram) 47.0 s 31.3 MB\nall (6-gram) 35.9 s 33.2 MB\nall (7-gram) 33.2 s 35.1 MB\nTable 2 .

Impact of the n-gram size on matching time\nFigure 4 shows that the longer the n-grams, the faster\nthe search, whatever the interpretation2. Longern-grams\nmeans less collisions, and thus smaller buckets. Differences\nbetween exact, transposed or without rhythm search perfor-\nmances are mostly due to the selectivity of the search cri-\nteria. Unlike transposed search (T R), we eliminate for an\nexact search (E X) records in the Ô¨Årst bucket (retrieved using\nthe NAS of the Ô¨Årst n-gram) by checking the Ô¨Årst note on the\nn-gram. This decreases the comparisons to perform. Search\ntransposed with rhythm and search exact with rhythm ex-\nhibit similar performances, and run faster than T Ror E X\nsince we Ô¨Ålter records using an additional signature.\nFinally we study the search time in Table 3 and compare\nperformances with those of an exhaustive scan. MS-Index\noverperforms for all datasets the exhaustive search (the ra-\ntio ranging from 800% to 10,000%). The search time with\nMS-Index does not depend on the descriptors size: wima is\ntwice larger than gut but searches are performed 4 times\n2We limit the presentation of the results to exact search.\n367Poster Session 3\ncoll.

Searches\nwith rhythm are faster since they Ô¨Ålter out records in the Ô¨Årst\nbucket (resp. n-grams) for the MS-Index (resp. exhaustive\nscan), skipping useless comparisons. The speed-up is lower\nforgut than for other collections. The rationale is that gut\npresents a few, large Ô¨Åles (137) with more records for each\ndocument in a bucket. Since the id of the document is also\na Ô¨Åltering condition (we try to match an entry of the Ô¨Årst\nbucket with one of the second bucket from the same docu-\nment), more matching attempts are carried out.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWe described in this paper a practical approach to the prob-\nlem of indexing pattern-based searches in a large score li-\nbrary. Our solution supports exact and approximate searches,\nand permits to reÔ¨Åne exact searches by taking account of the\nmany components that constitute a melodic descriptor. Our\nexperiments show that a few milliseconds sufÔ¨Åce to obtain\nthe result in all cases even for signiÔ¨Åcantly large datasets.\nA nice feature of our index is that it also acts as an ini-\ntial Ô¨Ålter in a two-steps similarity search method that per-\nforms a Ô¨Ånal check on the candidates against the full de-\nscriptor. This leaves the opportunity to adapt the edit dis-\ntance to the speciÔ¨Åcs of music score similarity search. We\nare currently investigating the relevance of such adaptations\nwith our users.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nComplex networks have received much attention in recent\nyears due to their capability of characterizing and helping in\nthe understanding of many interdisciplinary aspects of the\nreal-world [3]. Regarding music and artistic aspects, music\nnetworks have been studied and their topological character-\nistics shown to be useful for the analysis of dynamics and\nrelations between the involved elements. Examples are the\nwork of Gleiser and Danon [13] concerning a collaboration\nnetwork of jazz artists and bands; the work of Parket et al [8]\nabout a social network of contemporaneous musicians; and\nthe work of Cano et al [12] involving an analysis of the sim-\nilarities between songs and bands.\nCommunity structures have also been studied in music\nnetworks. Teitelbaum et al [19] analysed two different so-\ncial networks using similarities and collaborative attributes\nof music artists. They described some organization patterns\nand they comment aspects that reÔ¨Çect in the growth of such\nnetworks.

Differently, the use of symbolic format like MIDI,\nmay indicate a clearer analysis of what is in fact contributing\nfor the discrimination of the genres [15]. On the other hand,\nMarkov models on high-level rhythm features is an area rel-\natively few explored nowadays. Markov chains in rhythm\nfeatures and their capability for discriminating music gen-\nres has been studied by [3]. The authors investigated that\nuse of Markov chains with memory one and two suggests\nan evidence that the pattern of note values in the percussion\nmay differ from one genre to another.\nOur main goal is to analyse the community structure of\nmusic networks, which is a new and promissing research\narea. We believe that mixing temporal features (rhythmic\npatterns) and global topology information from proper mu-\nsic networks can be effective in understanding the relation-\nship of music genres. We summarize our main contribu-\ntions as: comparison of different 1) distance metrics, and\n2) community detection algorithms in order to Ô¨Ånd commu-\nnity structures in the music networks, deÔ¨Åning a completely\nunsupervised and low computational cost approach.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: sec-\ntion 2 describes the proposed method; and section 3 presents\nthe primarily experiments and provide some discussions. Fi-\nnally, section 4 shows the conclusions and Ô¨Ånal remarks.\n2. METHOD\n2.1 Data Description\nThe database consists of 280 samples (or songs) in MIDI\nformat equally divided into four genres: blues, mpb (Brazil-\nian popular music), reggae and rock. Although it indicates a\nsmall database, these songs contain high variability in their\nrhythmic patterns. Besides, this database allows a qualita-\ntive investigation of the music graphs (by visual inspection\nof their topology). Our motivation for choosing these four\ngenres is the availability of online MIDI samples with con-\n447Poster Session 3\nFigure 1 .

First beat starts at 0.\nsiderable quality and the different tendencies they represent.\nDespite being simpler to analyse than audio Ô¨Åles, MIDI\nformats have the advantage of being a symbolic representa-\ntion, which offers a deeply analysis of the involved elements\nand takes much less space. We used the Sibelius software\nand the free Midi Toolbox for Matlab computing environ-\nment [18]. In this toolbox a MIDI Ô¨Åle is represented as a\nnote matrix that provides information like relative duration\n(in beats), MIDI channel, MIDI pitch, among others. The\nrelative note duration is represented in this matrix through\nrelative numbers (for example, 1 for quarter note, 0.5 for\neighth note, 0.25 for sixteenth note and so on). Sibelius\nsoftware has an option called ‚ÄúLive Playback‚Äù. If this op-\ntion is not marked, the note values in the MIDI Ô¨Åle respects\ntheir relative proportion (e.g., the eighth note is always 0.5).\nIn this way, we can solve possible Ô¨Çuctuations in tempo.\nFor each song the track related to the percussion is ex-\ntracted. We propose that the percussion track of a song is\nintrinsically suitable to represent the rhythm in terms of note\nvalues dynamics. Once we have separated the percussion\ntrack, we can obtain a vector that contains the sequence of\nrelative note values present in it. The instrumentation is not\nbeen considered. If two or more note events occurs at the\nsame beat, the median duration of them is taken. To illus-\ntrate the idea, Figure 1 shows the Ô¨Årst measures of the per-\ncussion track of the music From Me To You (The Beatles).\nPart of the percussion matrix corresponding to the second\nmeasure is indicated in Table 1. As we can see, different\ninstrument events occur at a same beat. Taking the median\nvalue in such cases, the Ô¨Ånal note duration vector of this\nmeasure will be: [0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5]. For each song\nin the database, we compute the note vector of the whole\npercussion. All these steps can be automatically performed.\n2.2 Markov modeling for note duration dynamics\nMarkov chains use a conditional probability structure to cal-\nculate the probability of future events based on one or more\npast events [5]. We can analyse different numbers of pastevents, which indicates the order of the chain. A Ô¨Årst order\nMarkov chain takes into consideration only a predecessor of\na event. If instead, the predecessor‚Äôs predecessor is consid-\nered, then we have a second order Markov chain, and so on.\nGenerally, an nth-order Markov chain is represented by a\ntransition matrix of n+ 1 dimensions. This is an interesting\nmatrix, since it gives the information about the likelihood of\nan event‚Äôs occurrence, given the previous nstates.\nIn our case, the events are the relative note values of the\npercussion in the songs, obtained with the steps described\nin section 2.1. For each song (represented by a vector of\nnote values), we compute the Ô¨Årst and second order transi-\ntion matrices. Therefore, we have the probability that each\nnote value or a pair of note values is followed by other note\nduration in the song. Higher-order Markov chains tend to\nincorporate senses of phrasal structure [2], while Ô¨Årst-order\nones help to identify more often subsequent notes.\nIn order to reduce data dimensionality, we performed a\npreliminary analysis of the relative frequency of note values\nand pairs of note values concerning all the songs, in a way\nthat extremelly rare transitions were discarded. For the Ô¨Årst\norder Markov chain we have a matrix of probabilities with\n18 rows and 18 columns (we considered 18 different note\nvalues in this dataset). Each entry (i, j)of this matrix ex-\npresses the probability that a note value iis followed by a\nnote value jin the percussion of the respective song. Then\nthis matrix is treated as a 1 x 364 feature vector.\nFor the second order Markov chain, the matrix of proba-\nbilities for each song is 167 (rows) x 18 columns, treated as\na 1 x 3006 (167 * 18) feature vector (we considered 167 dif-\nferent pair of note values). Similar, each entry (i, j)of this\nmatrix expresses the probability that a speciÔ¨Åc pair of note\nvalues represented in line ifollows a speciÔ¨Åc note value j.\nIf we concatenate both feature vectors we will have the Ô¨Ånal\nfeature vector of each song with 3330 elements. It is in-\nteresting to mention that, we experimented to built the mu-\nsic networks considering Ô¨Årst and second order probabilities\nseparately. However, for both isolated cases, the Clauset-\nNewman-Moore community detection algorithm clustered\n5 different groups, while considering feature vectors com-\nposed by the concatenation of Ô¨Årst and second order models\nled to the detection of 4 groups. This fact suggests that a\nsingle Markov chain is not sufÔ¨Åciently to model all the dy-\nnamics that characterizes the 4 original genres. Another ev-\nidence is that when we consider both Markov chains, the\naccuracy obtained in the classiÔ¨Åcation of these four gen-\nres is higher: 70% for Ô¨Årst-other Markov chain, 85% for\nthe second-orther, and 92% for both chains. (We used the\nBayessian classiÔ¨Åer under Gaussian hyphothesis.)\n2.3 Music Networks\nA complex network is a graph that exhibits a relatively so-\nphisticated structure between its elements when compared\n44812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nto regular and uniformly random structures. Basically speak-\ning, a network may be composed by vertices, edges (or links)\nand a mapping that associates a weight in the connection of\ntwo vertices. The edges usually has the form w(i, j)indicat-\ning a link from vertex ito vertex jwith weight w(i, j). Rep-\nresenting music genres as complex networks may be inter-\nesting to study relations between the genres characteristics,\nthrough a systematic analysis of topological and structural\nfeatures of the network.\nFrom the Ô¨Årst and second-order transition matrixes of the\nMarkov chains we can build a music network. Each vertex\nrepresents a song. The links between them represent the dis-\ntance of the two respective songs, considering their vectors\nof conditional probabilities of the note values. However,\nwith a full-connected network it may be difÔ¨Åcult to obtain\nintricate structure. There are several forms to deÔ¨Åne which\nvertices will be connected and several distance metrics. We\npropose some possibilities in the following and try to form\nclusters of vertices that can represent the music genres.\n3. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION\nIt is worthwhile to mention that the proposed characteriza-\ntion of the music genres is performed in an unsupervised\nway (community Ô¨Ånding algorithms). The obtained groups\nare based on similarities in the feature set and the classes\nare not supposed to be known in advance. To illustrate the\ncomplexity of the problem, Figure 2 presents the Ô¨Årst and\nsecond components (new features) obtained by LDA (Lin-\near Discriminant Analysis), which is a supervised technique\nfor feature analysis whose principal aim is to maximize class\nseparability. Even with the LDA new features, reggae and\nrock classes are still overlapped. This overlapping could\nbe observed in all performed experiments. Considering the\nrhythms patterns, rock and reggae music are pretty similar.\nWe know that the use of only four genres with seventy\nsamples each may represent a small dataset. Our purpose is\nto perform an initial study of rhythmic features and its rep-\nresentation, but with an evidence that the proposed features\nmay be useful and viable for genre characterization.\n3.1 Community detection on K-NN graphs\nThrough the dynamics of the note values in the percussion\nwe built several networks. From the point of view of parti-\ntioning the genres into communities, different groups may\nbe obtained, depending on the used criteria. In this sec-\ntion, we used the Clauset, Newman and Moore [1] and Gir-\nvan and Newman [10] algorithms for community detection.\nSuch algorithms are widely known in the complex networks\nliterature. The former is based on a hierarchical clustering\nof the dataset. The latter is based on centrality metrics to\ndetermine the community boundaries.\nFigure 2 .

The groups in network of Figure 3.\nFor each of the following cases, the networks may be\nbuilt as follows: 1) From the feature matrix (with 280lines\n(the songs) and 3330 columns (the features)), we computed\nthe distance between each pair of feature vector (or each\npair of song). This led to a 280 x280symmetric matrix\nof distances, with zero values in the diagonal. In this case,\nwe have a full network, with all vertices connected to each\nother; 2) For each song (or vertex), we only link the Knear-\nest songs of it. The weight of each link is the distance be-\ntween this par of songs; 3) Consider the obtained K-regular\nnetwork. Or; 4) For each vertex, take the mean distance,\nconsidering the linked vertices. Keep the link between ver-\ntices only with their distance is smaller than the mean dis-\ntance. The main variations of the networks analysed here\nare consequence of the choice of different distance metrics,\ndifferent values of K, and the execution or not of step 4.\nFor the network showed in Figure 3 we used the cosine\ndistance, K= 10 and kept the network 10regular. The\nsongs are spread as indicated in Table 2. Each group has a\ndifferent dominant class. Blues and mpb songs are concen-\ntrated in G3 and G1, respectively. Reggae songs are almost\nequally divided into the groups. Rock songs are almost 50%\nin G1, overlapping with mpb songs. The other 50% divided\ninto the remaining groups. This behavior substantially re-\nÔ¨Çects the projections of LDA in Figure 2. The G3 group\nreÔ¨Çects the blues songs that are more discriminative. The\nG1 group reÔ¨Çects mainly the overlapping present in mpb,\nreggae and rock. And G2 and G4 mainly reÔ¨Çect the overlap-\nping between reggae and rock songs.\nFor the same network, Figure 4 shows the groups ob-\n449Poster Session 3\nFigure 3 . The network of genres.

Since it is\nan algorithm based on vertex centrality indices, the network\nwas split into nine groups. The result is still interesting\nsince many songs of a same genre are placed together in\neach group. In addition, this result opens a promising fur-\nther studies aimed at analysing the presence of sub-genres\nin these small groups. Are, for example, blues-rock or pop-\nrock songs more concentrated in a speciÔ¨Åc group? This is an\ninteresting study that can beneÔ¨Åt of this investigative work.\nFigure 4 . The network of genres.

Groups\nformed by the Girvan and Newman algorithm.\nIf instead of cosine distance, we use the Euclidian dis-\ntance, we will get the network in Figure 5, according to the\nClauset, Newman and Moore algorithm. Table 3 shows the\ngroups. Reggae songs are more concentrated (31 in G3);\nand G4 is smaller than in the Ô¨Årst case, with only 12 songs.\nConsidering all the experiments, including those not pre-\nFigure 5 .

The groups in network of Figure 5.\nsented here, we can describe some overall characteristics\nof the clusters found by the Clauset-Newman-Moore algo-\nrithm. The most discriminative genre is blues. In most ex-\nperiments one group was always small. Actually, in some\nvariations the algorithm returned three large groups. This\nmay indicate that, although we have four genres labeled by\nthe usual taxonomy, in terms of the proposed rhythm fea-\ntures there are only three. If we listen to the whole song, we\nmay differ the genres in a successful way. But if we listen to\nonly the percussion track of each song, this discrimination\nmay be harder and one song could be labeled into more than\none genre. Therefore, considering that we have a completely\nunsupervised approach, the proposed investigation indicates\nthat note duration dynamics can be a useful information in\ncharacterizing and discriminating music genres.\n3.2 Spectral graph partitioning\nTopologic-based graph metrics are generally correlated and\ndependent [16]. For this reason, spectral analysis is a pow-\nerful tool that has been widely explored in the characteriza-\ntion of graphs and complex networks. The basic idea can\nbe summarized as follows: in mathematical terms, when we\nanalyze a graph in the spectral domain we have a represen-\ntation in terms of orthogonal components, which means that\ninformation is somehow uncorrelated. Thus, proper analy-\nsis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of adjacency or laplacian\nmatrices idenÔ¨Åcates aspects that cannot be seen in the topol-\n45012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nReggae Blues Rock Mpb\nG1 20 4 13 8\nG2 21 46 6 15\nG3 17 9 23 20\nG4 12 11 18 27\nTable 4 . The groups in network of Figure 6.\nogy domain. Please, refer to [4,11] for a good review on the\nmathematical fundamentals of algebraic graph theory.\nIn this paper, we use a spectral graph partitioning method\nbased on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian\nmatrix. Let AandBbe the adjacency and incidence matri-\nces of a graph G={V, E}, where Vis a set of vertices and\nEis a set of edges. The Laplacian matrix, Q, is given by:\nQ=BBT= ‚àÜ‚àíA (1)\nwhere ‚àÜis a diagonal matrix of the degrees of V.\nThe second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix\nis known as the algebraic connectivity of a graph and it has\nmany interesting properties. More precisely, the eigenvector\nassociated to this eigenvalue, known as the Fiedler vector\n[9], has proven to be directly related to graph connectivity.\nOften, in practice, the signs of the Fiedler vector can be used\nto partition a graph in two regions. This can be seen as a\nquantization to binary digits, zero or one.\nHere, we propose to do a quantization of the Fiedler vec-\ntor coefÔ¨Åcients in Cvalues, where Crepresents the num-\nber of desirable clusters or groups. By doing so, we are\nessentially partitioning a graph or network in Csubgraphs\nor communities, which is equivalent to Ô¨Ånding C‚àí1val-\nleys in the histogram that represents the distribution of its\ncoefÔ¨Åcient values. In this paper, the thresholds were chosen\nby visual inspection of the histogram, but several methods\nfor automatic multilevel threshold estimation are available\nin the image processing literature [14]. A deeper mathemat-\nical analysis and discussion about the eigenvectors of the\nLaplacian matrix and its properties can be found in [16].\nFor the following experiment, we used the non-regular\nnetwork generated by Ô¨Årst building a K-NN graph with K=\n30and then, for each vertex v, cutting the edges whose\nweights were above a threshold obtained by averaging the\nweights of every edge incident on v. Thus, the resulting net-\nwork is not modeled as a k-regular graph anymore. Figure 6\nshows the resulting network, with the four detected clusters.\nThe Fiedler vector for this graph and the corresponding his-\ntogram for the distribution of its coefÔ¨Åcients are plotted in\nFigures 7 and 8, respectively. The distribution of coefÔ¨Åcient\nvalues of the second smallest eigenvector of the Laplacian\nmatrix clearly indicates the presence of different clusters or\ncommunities in the network. Table 4 shows the groups for\nthe spectral partition. Rock and mpb songs are more spread\nin the four groups than in the former cases.\nFigure 6 . The network of genres by the Fiedler vector.\nFigure 7 . The Fiedler vector for the network in Figure 6.\n4. FINAL REMARKS AND ONGOING WORK\nIn this investigative study we proposed a characterization of\nmusic genres by detecting communities in complex music\nnetworks. Each vertex represents a song through a feature\nvector that captures the likelihood of Ô¨Årst and second order\nMarkov chains of the note values in the percussion track.\nThe distance between the feature vectors (or between the\nsongs) deÔ¨Ånes the weight of the links. We tested two differ-\nent distance metrics (cosine and Euclidian) and two different\napproaches for Ô¨Ånding clusters in the network (traditional\nalgorithms on K-NN graphs and spectral partioning).\nRegarding the formed clusters, we found that the results\nare promising since in most experiments each cluster is dom-\ninated by a different genre. Observing the LDA projections,\nit is possible to see that many samples from different gen-\nres are overlapped (mainly reggae and rock samples). LDA\nis a supervised technique that maximizes class separability.\nTherefore, even without any supervised analysis, signiÔ¨Åcant\nresults could be obtained. In addition, most MIDI databases\navailable in the Internet are single-labeled, sometimes with\ndifferent taxonomies of music genres. In some situations,\n451Poster Session 3\nFigure 8 . Distribution of coefÔ¨Åcient values of the Fiedler\nvector for the network depicted in Figure 6.\na sample receives different labels in different sites (for ex-\nample, wikipedia). This introduces noise to the system and\nreÔ¨Çects in the evaluation of the results.\nFrom the obtained communities and considering the four\ngenres used in this study, we can say that blues is the more\ndiscriminative genre. Representing the older genre, and hav-\ning speciÔ¨Åc characteristics, blues may have inÔ¨Çuenced the\nfollowing genres, which contributted along years for a mix-\nture of some features between genres. Reggae, rock and\nmpb are more similar genres, sharing many overlapped sam-\nples. In fact, along years mpb music started to include dif-\nferent rhythms like rock and latine music such as reggae and\nsamba. Reggae music, on the other hand, had stylistc origns\nin jazz, R&B, rocksteady and others. These tendencies are\ninteresting and are somehow reÔ¨Çected in the results. Actu-\nally, the use of graph representation (instead of clustering\nmethods in a vector space) is promising, since it combines\ngraph topological features and similarity characteristcs in\norder to infer the data structures.\nMusic networks is somehow a new reseach area in the\nliterature. To the best of our knowledge, we could not Ô¨Ånd\na different approach that used partitional network methods\nfor music genres. Comparing with the hierarquical cluster-\ning with Euclidian distance metric used in [3], the groups\nin Table 3 have some differences: the blues songs are sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly more concentrated in one group; the largest group\ndoes not concentrate too many samples of all genres, which\nis not the case in the hierarquical clustering. An advantage\nof this kind of unsupervised analysis relies on the possibil-\nity of the characterization of music sub-genres, which can\ncontribute to the deÔ¨Ånition of a more uniÔ¨Åed taxonomy.\nThere are many possibilities for future works. First, many\nother rhythm attributes can be analysed (like the intensity\nof the beat), as well as other open music databases [15].\nAnother interesting work that has been started is the inves-\ntigation of sub-genres present in sub-clusters of the main\ngroups. It would be promising if a system could be sen-\nsitive to various styles inside a genre. Contextual analysis\nthrough Markov Random Field models may also bring ben-eÔ¨Åts, since with this kind of modeling we can measure how\nindividual elements are inÔ¨Çuenced by their neighbors, ana-\nlyzing spatial conÔ¨Åguration patterns of vertices.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThe recent age of music proliferation has raised the need\nfor automatic algorithms to efÔ¨Åciently search and discover\nmusic. Many successful recommendation systems rely on\ntextual metadata provided by expert musicologists or social\nservices in the form of semantic tags ‚Äì keywords or short\nphrases that capture relevant characteristics of music pieces,\nranging from genre and instrumentation, to mood and usage.\nBy bridging the gap between music and human semantics,\ntags allow semantic retrieval based on transparent textual\ndescriptions, or query-by-example recommendation based\non semantic similarity (as opposed to acoustic similarity) to\na query song.\nMeta-data-based methods work well in practice, provided\nthat enough annotations are available. However, the cold\nstart problem and the prohibitive cost of manual labour limit\ntheir applicability to large-scale applications. Therefore, the\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.deployment of modern music recommendation systems can\nbeneÔ¨Åt from the development of auto-taggers, i.e., machine-\nlearning algorithms that automatically analyze and index mu-\nsic with semantic tags, which can then be used to improve\nthe search experience and speed up the discovery of desired\ncontent.\n1.1 Previous work\nMost auto-taggers are based on music content analysis and\nare trained from a database of annotated songs (e.g., see [8,\n10, 12, 20]). After extracting a set of acoustic features from\neach training song, a series of statistical models are esti-\nmated, each of which capturing the characteristic acoustic\npatterns in the songs that are associated with one of the tags\nfrom a given vocabulary. When analyzing a new song, the\nauto-tagger processes the time series of acoustic features of\nthe song and outputs a vector of tag-afÔ¨Ånities. The afÔ¨Ånity-\nvector can then be transformed into a semantic multinomial\n(SMN), i.e., a probability distribution characterizing the rel-\nevance of each tag to a song. A song is then annotated\nby selecting the top-ranking tags in its SMN, or the SMN\nitself can be used as a high-level descriptor, e.g., for re-\ntrieving songs based on semantic similarity. A number of\ndiscriminative (e.g., see [3, 8, 9, 12, 18, 23]) and generative\n(e.g., see [10, 17, 20, 21]) machine learning algorithms have\nbeen proposed to model predictive acoustic patterns in au-\ndio content based on a bag-of-features (BoF) representation,\nwhich treats audio features independently and ignores their\ntemporal order. Recently, Coviello et al. [6] proposed to\nleverage dynamic texture mixture (DTM) models for auto-\ntagging purposes. More precisely, DTM-based auto-taggers\nmodel audio fragments (i.e., time series of audio features\nextracted from a few seconds of musical signal) as the out-\nput of linear dynamical systems. This approach explicitly\ncaptures temporal structures in the musical signal, whereas\na BoF representation discards such dynamics.\nAt a higher level of abstraction, contextual approaches\nhave focused on modeling the semantic context that drives\nthe correlation between different tags (e.g., a song tagged\nwith ‚Äúdrums‚Äù is more likely to also be tagged with ‚Äúelectric\nguitar‚Äù than ‚Äúviolin‚Äù). While content-based models oper-\n705Poster Session 6\nate on low-level acoustic features to predict semantic multi-\nnomials, contextual models are designed to capture mean-\ningful tag correlations in these SMNs, to reinforce accu-\nrate tag predictions while suppressing spurious ones. So,\na contextual model naturally complements a content-based\nmodel, which usually treats tags independently. Combin-\ning them has been shown to improve performance. State-\nof-the-art solutions are based on discriminative approaches\n(e.g., support vector machines [14], boosting [1], ordinal re-\ngression [24]) as well as generative models (e.g., Dirichlet\nmixture models (DMM) [13]).\n1.2 Original contribution\nThe main contribution of this paper is to propose decision-\nfusion , which uses semantic context modeling to simultane-\nously leverage the beneÔ¨Åts of different content-based auto-\ntaggers. Using two or more content-based auto-taggers that\nemphasize diverse aspects of the musical signal (e.g., only\ntimbre vs. temporal dynamics), we collect alternative opin-\nions on each song-tag association. We expect that, besides\nmodeling the context between tags predicted from the same\nauto-tagger, context modeling can capture the correlations\nthat arise between tag predictions based on different auto-\ntaggers, leading to a more sophisticated system.\nThis offers a solution to the problem of selecting or com-\nbining alternative annotation models that previous work has\npointed out. Coviello et al. [6], for example, noted that\neven though their DTM-based auto-tagger generally outper-\nformed a BoF approach based on Gaussian mixture models\n(GMM), the improvements were most signiÔ¨Åcant on tags\nwith clear temporal characteristics; for some tags, in fact,\nthe GMM-based model was still favorable (i.e., tags where\n‚Äútimbre says it all‚Äù).\nExperimental results show that decision-fusion leads to\nimproved annotation and retrieval performance compared\nto i) each individual auto-tagger, ii) each individual auto-\ntagger in tandem with a contextual model (the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù\ncontext-based approach) and iii) various other approaches\nto combining multiple content-based auto-taggers, such as\nÔ¨Åxed-combination rules and the regression-based combina-\ntion algorithms proposed by Tomasik et al. [19]. We note\nthat the focus of the latter was slightly different from our\nwork, since it investigates the combination of tags predicted\nfrom different information sources (i.e., content-based auto-\ntags, social tags, collaborative-Ô¨Åltering-based tags), rather\nthan from different content-based auto-taggers only. In ad-\ndition, as semantic context modeling is naturally comple-\nmentary to any content-based auto-tagger, we corroborate\nthe intuition that there is a beneÔ¨Åt in combining DTM-based\ntemporal modeling and semantic context modeling, which\nhas not been shown before.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A\nbrief review of the automatic music tagging problem and themodels used in this work are presented in Section 2. Sec-\ntion 3 discusses decision-fusion. Lastly, the experimental\nsetup and results are reported in Sections 4 and 5, respec-\ntively.\n2. AUTOMATIC MUSIC TAGGING\nThe automatic task of music tagging is widely tackled as\na supervised multi-class labeling problem [2], where each\nclass corresponds to a tag wiof a semantic vocabulary V\n(e.g., ‚Äúrock‚Äù, ‚Äúdrum‚Äù, ‚Äútender‚Äù, ‚Äúmellow‚Äù). The music con-\ntent of a song is represented as a time series of low-level\nacoustic featuresY={y1,...,yT}, where each feature\nis extracted from a short snippet of the audio signal and\nTdepends on the length of the song. The semantic con-\ntent with respect to Vis represented as an annotation vector\nc= (c1,...,c|V|), whereci>0only if there is a posi-\ntive association between a song and the tag wi. The goal\nof an auto-tagging system is to infer the relevant semantic\nannotations of unseen songs.\nAt this aim, a set of statistical models is trained to capture\nthe patterns in the audio feature space associated with each\ntag inV, from a databaseD={(Yd,cd)}|D|\nd=1of annotated\nsongs. Based on the learned tag models, the auto-tagger can\nprocess the acoustic features extracted from a novel song\nYand produce a vector of tag-afÔ¨Ånities, which is mapped\ninto a semantic multinomial œÄ= (œÄ1,...,œÄ|V|)lying on a\nsemantic space (i.e.,/summationtext\niœÄi= 1 withœÄi‚â•0), whereœÄi=\nP(wi|Y)represents the probability that the ithtag applies\nto songY.\nIn order to leverage high level relationships that arise in\nthe tag predictions of content-based auto-taggers, contex-\ntual approaches additionally introduce a second modeling\nlayer to capture meaningful tag correlations in the SMNs.\nIn particular, a content-based auto-tagger is used to produce\na SMNœÄdfor each songYdinD, while a second layer of\nstatistical models is trained onto {(œÄd,cd)}|D|\nd=1, to capture\nwhich patterns in the SMNs are predictive for each tag. For\na novel songY, the contextual tag models can therefore be\nused to reÔ¨Åne the semantic multinomial œÄproduced by the\ncontent-based auto-tagger.\nMusic annotation involves Ô¨Ånding the tags that best de-\nscribe a song; this is achieved by selecting the subset of tags\nthat peak in its semantic multinomial. Retrieval given a one-\ntag query, requires ranking all songs in a database based on\ntheir relevance to the query, e.g., the corresponding entry in\nthe semantic multinomials [20].\nIn the following we review a variety of content-based\nauto-tagging strategies, where low-level acoustic content is\nrepresented either as a bag-of-features (Sections 2.1.1 and\n2.1.2) or as a time series of features (Section 2.1.3). Ad-\nditionally, Section 2.2 introduces a contextual approach for\nmodeling tag correlations as well.\n70612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n2.1 Content modeling\nContent-based auto-taggers have been designed to model\nthe acoustic content associated with tags and represented as\na bag-of-features using both generative and discriminative\nmodels, as in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, respectively; con-\nversely, the use of time series of audio features for music\ntagging has been considered in the generative approach of\nSection 2.1.3 only.\n2.1.1 The Gaussian mixture model (GMM)\nTurnbull et al. [20], proposed to capture the most prominent\nacoustic textures associated to each tag wiinVwith a prob-\nability distribution p(y|wi)over the space of audio features\ny, which is a Gaussian mixture model (GMM):\np(y|wi) =R/summationdisplay\nr=1awi\nrN(y|¬µwi\nr,Œ£wi\nr), (1)\nwhereRis the number of mixture components, N(¬∑|¬µ,Œ£)a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution with mean ¬µand covari-\nance matrix Œ£, andawirthe mixing weights. The parame-\nters{awir,¬µwir,Œ£wi\nr}R\nr=1of each tag model p(y|wi)arees-\ntimated from the bag-of-features extracted from the songs\ninDthat are positively associated with wi, using the hierar-\nchical expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [22].\nGiven the audio content of a new song Y={y1,...,yT},\nthe relevance of each tag wiis computed using the Bayes\nrule:\nœÄi=P(wi|Y) =p(Y|wi)P(wi)\np(Y), (2)\nwhereP(wi)is the tag prior (assumed to be uniform) and\np(Y)the song prior, i.e., p(Y) =/summationtext|V|\nj=1p(Y|wj)P(wj).\nThe likelihood term in (2) is computed as the geometric av-\nerage of the individual sequence likelihoods, i.e., p(Y|wi) =/producttextT\nt=1p(yt|wi)1\nT.\n2.1.2 Boosting (BST)\nThe boosting approach proposed by Eck et al. [8] is a super-\nvised discriminative algorithm that learns a binary classiÔ¨Åer\nfor each tag wiin the vocabulary V, from both the posi-\ntive and the negative training examples for that tag. More\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, it constructs a strong classiÔ¨Åer which combines\na set of simpler classiÔ¨Åers, called weak learners , in an itera-\ntive way. As weak learners, according to [1], we use single\nstumps (i.e., binary thresholding on one low-level acoustic\nfeature).\nA novel songYis classiÔ¨Åed by each of the binary clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers and Platt scaling is applied to produce a probability\nestimateœÄi=P(wi|Y)for each tag wi. We will refer to\nthis approach as BST.2.1.3 Temporal modeling (DTM)\nCoviello et al. [6] proposed a novel auto-tagger built upon\nthe DTM model, which explicitly captures both the timbral\nand the temporal structures of music that are most predic-\ntive for each tag. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the dynamic texture (DT)\nmodel [7] treats an audio fragment y1:œÑas output of a linear\ndynamical system. The model consists of a double embed-\nded stochastic process, in which a lower dimensional Gauss-\nMarkov process xtencodes the dynamics (evolution) of the\nacoustic component ytover time\nEach tag distribution is modeled with a dynamic texture\nmixture (DTM) [4] probability density over sequences of\naudio feature vectors:\np(y1:œÑ|wi) =R/summationdisplay\nr=1a(wi)\nrp(y1:œÑ|Œò(wi)\nr), (3)\nwhereRis the number of mixtures and Œò(wi)\nr is therth\nDT component. The parameters {a(wi)\nr,Œò(wi)\nr}R\nr=1are es-\ntimated based on the audio fragments extracted from the\nsongs inDpositively associated with the tag wi, using an ef-\nÔ¨Åcient hierarchical EM algorithm for DTM (HEM-DTM) [5].\nGiven the audio fragments extracted from a new song\nY={y1\n1:œÑ, ...,yF\n1:œÑ}, whereFdepends on the length of\nthe song, the relevance of tag wiis computed using Bayes‚Äô\nrule (2), with the likelihood computed as the geometric aver-\nage of the individual sequence likelihoods smoothed by the\nsequence length œÑ, i.e.,p(Y|wi) =/producttextF\nt=1p(yt\n1:œÑ|wi)1\nFœÑ.\n2.2 Context modeling (DMM)\nAs mentioned in Section 1.1, different approaches have been\nproposed to model contextual relationships in SMNs; in this\nwork, we use the DMM [13]. The DMM is a generative\nmodel that assumes the SMNs œÄof the songs positively as-\nsociated to a tag wiare distributed accordingly to a mixture\nof Dirichlet distributions over the semantic space deÔ¨Åned by\nV:\np(œÄ|wi; ‚Ñ¶w) =R/summationdisplay\nr=1Œ≤wiDir(œÄ|Œ±wi\nr), (4)\nwhere R is the number of mixtures, Œ≤wi\nkare the mixing\nweights, and Dir (¬∑|Œ±)is a Dirichelet distribution of param-\netersŒ±= (Œ±1,...,Œ±|V|). The parameters of the DMM for\neach tagwiinVare estimated from the semantic multino-\nmials extracted from the songs in Dpositively associated\nwith the tag, via the generalized EM algorithm [16].\nHence, given a new song described by the SMN\nœÄ= (œÄ1,...,œÄ|V|), the relevance of a tag wiis computed\nusing Bayes‚Äô rule to get the tag posterior probabilities in the\ncontext space:\nŒ∏i=P(wi|œÄ) =p(œÄ|wi)P(wi)\np(œÄ). (5)\n707Poster Session 6\nAll the tag posterior probabilities form the contextual multi-\nnomial distribution of the song, i.e., Œ∏= (Œ∏1, ...,Œ∏|V|),\nwhich can then be used for semantic annotation and retrieval.\n3. DECISION-FUSION\nEach content-based auto-tagger generally emphasizes par-\nticular aspects of the musical signal. Despite some auto-\ntaggers could be preferred over others based on average per-\nformances (Table 1, part (a)), the spread in performances\nregistered on speciÔ¨Åc tags (e.g., see Figure 1) makes unclear\nif any auto-tagger may be the best. This leaves open the\nproblem of choosing the most appropriate method for each\ntag, or, indeed, the one of combining different auto-taggers.\nIn this paper we argue that semantic context modeling\ncan also be used as a strategy to combine different content-\nbased auto-taggers, which we name decision-fusion . Indeed,\nby modeling the patterns that arise from the tag predictions\ngenerated by different content-based auto-taggers, decision-\nfusion combines all the different opinions into a single pre-\ndiction and leverages the beneÔ¨Åts of each of the acoustic\ncharacteristics emphasized by the original auto-taggers.\nFormally, let us assume a group Aof different content-\nbased auto-tagging algorithms is available. For each song\ndin the databaseD, semantic multinomials œÄa\ndfora=\n1,...,|A|are computed (i.e., one for each auto-tagger in\nA) and pooled together into the aggregated semantic multi-\nnomial:\nœÄA\nd= (œÄ1\nd,...,œÄ|A|\nd), (6)\nwhich is intended to be normalized to sum to 1. In practice,\nit is as we are now working with a new semantic vocabulary\nVA=V1√ó¬∑¬∑¬∑√óV|A|of size|A|¬∑|V| , where each tag\nis replicated|A|times, one for each auto-tagger. Decision-\nfusion consists in training a set of semantic context models,\ni.e.,p(œÄA|wi)forwi= 1,...,|V|, over the aggregated se-\nmantic multinomials {(œÄA\nd,cd)}|D|\nd=1to capture both intra-\nand inter-auto-taggers tag correlations. Note that traditional\ncontext modeling acts on the SMNs of a single auto-tagger,\nthus capturing only intra-auto-tagger correlations.\nDecision-fusion can be implemented through a variety of\ncontext-modeling algorithms. In particular, in this work we\ntested the DMM presented in Section 2.2. Therefore, the ag-\ngregated SMNs œÄAof songs positively associated with tag\nwiare assumed to be distributed accordingly to a mixture of\nDirichlet distributions over the semantic space VA:\np(œÄA|wi) =R/summationdisplay\nr=1Œ≤wiDir(œÄA|Œ±wi\nr), (7)\nwhereŒ±= (Œ±1,...,Œ±|A|¬∑|V| ).\nAn unseen songYis Ô¨Årst processed by each of the content-\nbased auto-taggers available to produce the semantic multi-\nnomialsœÄafora= 1,...,|A|, which are then aggregated inœÄA. Finally, Bayes‚Äô rule as in Equation 5 is applied to com-\npute the posteriors Œ∏A\ni=p(wi|œÄA)for each tag wi, and to\nform a decision-fusing multinomial Œ∏A= (Œ∏A\n1,...,Œ∏A\n|V|).\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n4.1 Dataset\nIn our experiments, we used the CAL500 dataset [20], which\nconsists of 502 popular Western songs by as many different\nartists. The CAL500 dataset provides binary annotations,\nwhich are 1 when a tag applies to the song and 0 otherwise,\nbased on the opinions of human annotators. To accurately Ô¨Åt\nthe experimental models, we restrict ourselves to the subset\nof 97 tags that have at least 30 songs positively associated\nwith them (11 genre, 14 instrument, 25 acoustic quality, 6\nvocal characteristics, 35 emotion and 6 usage tags).\n4.2 Audio features\nThe acoustic content of each song in the collection is repre-\nsented by computing a time series of 34-bin Mel-frequency\nspectral features [15], extracted over half-overlapping win-\ndows of 92ms of audio signal. For the auto-tagger based on\nthe DTM, Mel-frequency spectral features are grouped into\nfragments of approximately 6s. (with 80% overlap), which\ncorresponds to œÑ= 125 consecutive feature vectors. For the\nauto-tagger based on the GMM, the Mel-frequency spectral\nfeatures are decorrelated using the DCT, and the resulting\nÔ¨Årst 13 Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients are augmented\nwith Ô¨Årst and second derivatives (MFCC-deltas). Lastly, for\nthe auto-tagger based on boosting, Ô¨Årst and second order\nstatistics of the MFCC deltas are computed every 5s., in\norder to reduce the computational burden [8] .\n4.3 Evaluation\nIn our experiments, we consider the models reviewed in Sec-\ntion 2.1, which are the content-based auto-taggers referred\nas GMM, BST, and DTM, and the semantic context mod-\neling based on the DMM. We obtained the authors‚Äô code\nto run each algorithm. We study model combination via\ndecision-fusion using the DMM and investigate all the pos-\nsible combinations among the content-based auto-taggers\nconsidered. For instance, when combining all the three auto-\ntaggers (i.e., when A={GMM,BST,DTM}) Equation 7\nacts on the aggregated semantic multinomials deÔ¨Åned as:\nœÄA\nd= (œÄGMM\nd,œÄBST\nd,œÄDTM\nd). (8)\nTo investigate the advantages of model combination via\ndecision-fusion, we compared its performances to a variety\nof combination techniques, such as Ô¨Åxed-combination rules\n[11] and trained-combiners based on regression [19], all of\n70812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwhich are applied on the outputs of the different content-\nbased auto-taggers (i.e., GMM, BST, DTM). We tested dif-\nferent Ô¨Åxed-combination rules (i.e., sum, product, arithmetic\naverage, minimum and maximum rule) in preliminary ex-\nperiments, with the sum rule (/summationtextrule) being the best. So,\nfor example, when/summationtextrule combines GMM, BST and DTM\nsumming the corresponding SMNs, the Ô¨Ånal semantic multi-\nnomial of each song sis:\nœÄSUM\ns=œÄGMM\ns+œÄBST\ns+œÄDTM\ns, (9)\nwhich is intended to be normalized to 1.\nAdditionally, we implemented the trained-combiner based\non linear regression (LinReg), which Tomasik et. al [19]\nshowed to outperform alternative regression techniques. In\nparticular, we use LinReg to learn, on a tag-by-tag bases,\nthe optimal coefÔ¨Åcients to combining different auto-taggers\nto predict a ground truth of annotated songs. We refer the\nreader to Section 3.3 of [19] for more details on this strategy.\nAnnotation and retrieval performances are measured fol-\nlowing [20]. Test set songs are annotated with the 10 most\nlikely tags in their SMNs, and annotation accuracy is re-\nported by computing precision, recall and F-score for each\ntag. Retrieval performance are evaluated with respect to\neach one-tag query in our vocabulary; we report mean av-\nerage precision (MAP), area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AROC) and top-10 precision (P10). All\nmetrics are averaged over all tags and are intended to be re-\nsult of 5 fold cross validation, where each song appeared in\nthe test set exactly once.\n5. RESULTS\nAnnotation and retrieval results are presented in Table 1.\nResults for (a) individual auto-taggers are in the Ô¨Årst block\nof the table, results for (b) standard contextual approaches\nare in the second block, and results for (c) content-based\nauto-tagger combination are in the last four blocks.\nFirst, we notice that for each combination of the content-\nbased auto-taggers considered, decision-fusion outperforms\nall the other combination techniques, except in recall, where\nLinReg is generally the best one. Second, differently from/summationtextrule and LinReg, decision-fusion always improves with\nrespect to the original content-based auto-taggers combined.\nDecision-fusion performs better by capturing the corre-\nlations that arise between tag predictions based on differ-\nent auto-taggers and, consequently, by indirectly leveraging\nvarious aspects of the musical signal emphasized by each\nof those auto-taggers. Indeed, decision-fusion of BoF auto-\ntaggers with the DTM has major beneÔ¨Åts, as it takes advan-\ntage of predictions that are based on different fundamentals,\ni.e., timbre and temporal dynamics vs. only timbre.

INTRODUCTION \nAs machine learning and data mining tools become ubiqui-\ntous and simple to implement, their potential to classify da-ta automatically, and to point out anomalies in that data, is extending to new disciplines. Most machine learning algo-rithms run on data that can be represented as numbers. While many types of datasets naturally lend themselves to numerical representations, much  of the richness of music \n(especially music expressed in symbolic forms such as scores) resists easily being converted to the numerical forms that enable classifica tion and clustering tasks.  The amount of preprocessing needed to extract the most \nmusically relevant data from notation encoded in Finale or Sibelius files, or even MIDI files, is often underestimated: musicologists are rarely content to work only with pitch classes and relative note lengths‚Äîto name two easily ex-tracted and manipulated types of information. They also want to know where a pitch fits within the currently im-plied key, whether a note is metrically strong or weak, what text is being sung at the same time, whether chords are in open or closed position, and so on. Such processing and analysis steps need to run ra pidly to handle the large reper-\ntories now available. A robust system for data mining needs to integrate reliable and well-developed classification tools with a wide variety of methods for extracting data from large collections of scores in a variety of encodings. \nThe features module newly added to the Python-\nbased, open source toolkit \nmusic21 , provides this needed \nbridge between the demands of music scholars and of com-\nputer researchers. Music21 [3] already has a well-\ndeveloped and expandable frame work for importing scores \nand other data from the most common symbolic music for-mats, such as MusicXML [4 ] (which Finale, Sibelius, \nMuseScore, and other notation software can produce), Kern/Humdrum [6], CCARH‚Äôs MuseData [11], Notewor-thy Composer, the common folk-music format ABC [10], and MIDI. Scores can easily be transformed from symbolic to sounding representations (b y uniting tied notes or mov-\ning transposing instruments to C, for instance); simultanei-ties can be reduced to chords  that represent the pitches \nsounding at any moment; and the key or metrical accents of a passage can be analyzed (e ven for passages that change \nkey without a change in key signature).  \nThe features module expands\n music21 ‚Äôs data mining \nabilities by adding a battery of commonly used numeric \nfeatures, such as numerical re presentations of elements pre-\nsent or absent in a piece (0s or  1s, used, for example, to in-\ndicate the presence of a change in a time signature), or con-tinuous values representing prevalence (for example, the percentage of all chords in a piece that are triadic). Collec-\ntions of these features can be used to train machine learning \nsoftware to classify works by composer, genre, or dance type. Or, making use of notational elements found in cer-tain input formats, they could classify works by graphical characteristics of particular interest to musicologists study- \nPermission to make digital or hard copi es of all or part of this work fo r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies \nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n387Poster Session 3\n  \n \ning the reception of the work . Such graphical elements \nmight identify the scribe, edito r, or publisher of a piece. \nIn the following sections, we will describe the feature-\nextraction methods ( FEMS ) of music21 . Because music21  \nhas many powerful, high-level tools for analysis and trans-\nformation, FEMS can be tailored to th e characteristics of \nparticular repertories and can be combined to create more powerful \nFEMS than those available in existing software \npackages. This paper describes how new FEMS can be add-\ned to music21  and demonstrates their usefulness in classi-\nfying both classical and popular works. \n2. FEATURE EXTRACTION IN MUSIC21 \n2.1 Feature Extractors from jSymbolic \nOne of the most useful aspects of the Features module is \nthe integration of 57 features of the 111 implemented in Cory McKay‚Äôs jSymbolic toolkit [9], a subset of his larger jMIR toolkit that classifies music encoded in MIDI [8].  \n(\nMusic21  aims for full jSymbolic compatibility in the near \nfuture.) Because music21  is ‚Äúencoding agnostic,‚Äù files in \nany supported format now have access to these FEMS , so \nthat MusicXML and ABC files (among others) can, without conversion, be run through the same extractors that jSym-bolic provided for MIDI files. In addition, Music21 \nFEMS \nare optimized so that closely related feature extractors that \nrequire the same preprocessing routines automatically use \ncached versions of the processe d data, rather than recreat-\ning it.  \nExample 1 shows how a single feature extractor, bor-\nrowed from jSymbolic, can be applied to data from several different sources and datatypes. While using a single fea-ture extractor on one or two works is not a useful way to classify these works, it is a convenient and informative way to understand the system and test the \nFEMS . All FEMS have \ndocumentation and code examples on the music21 website at http://mit.edu/music21. The website also gives instruc-tions for obtaining and installing the software, as well as tutorials and references on using the toolkit. \nExample 1 shows how the fraction of ascending notes \nin a movement of Handel‚Äôs Messiah (encoded as MuseDa-ta) can be found.  \nfrom music21 import * \nhandel = corpus.parse('hwv56/movement3-05.md') fe = features.jSymbolic.\\          DirectionOfMotionFeature(handel) feature = fe.extract() print feature.vector \n[0.5263] \nExample 1 . Feature extraction on a MuseData score. Example 2 shows feature extraction run first on a lo-\ncal file, and then on a file fro m the Internet. The feature ex-\ntractor determines whether the initial time signature is a tri-ple meter and returns 1 or 0.  The result is returned in a Py-thon list, since some \nFEMS return an array of results, such as \na 12-element histogram showing the count of each pitch class.  Like Example 1, this example uses file formats (ABC and MusicXML) that cannot be directly processed by jSymbolic. (In all further examples, the initial line, ‚Äúfrom music21 import *‚Äù is omitted.)  \n# a 4/4 basse danse in ABC format \nbd = converter.parse(\"/tmp/basseDanse20.abc\") fe = features.jSymbolic.TripleMeterFeature(bd) print fe.extract().vector \n[0] \n# softly-softly by Mark Paul, in 3/4 \nsoft = converter.parse(  \"http://static.wikifonia.org/10699/musicxml.xml\") fe.setData(soft) print fe.extract().vector \n[1] \nExample 2 . A local file and a web file in two different \nformats run through a triple-meter feature extractor. \n2.2 Feature Extractors Native to music21   \nIn addition to recreating the feature extraction methods of \njSymbolic, music21 ‚Äôs features.native sub-module includes \n17 new FEMS . These FEMS take advantage of the analytical \ncapabilities built into music21 , its ability to work with no-\ntational aspects (such as a note‚Äôs spelling or representation \nas tied notes), or the richer, object-oriented programming environment of Python. For example, native \nmusic21  \nFEMS can distinguish between correctly or incorrectly \nspelled triads within a polyphonic context. (The Incorrect-lySpelledTriadPrevalence \nFEM, called on Mozart‚Äôs pieces, \nreturns approximately 0.5% of all triads, mostly reflecting chromatic lower neighbors). Notational features that do not affect playback, such as a sc ribe‚Äôs predilection for beaming \neighth notes in pairs (as opposed to in groups of four) in 4/4, can similarly form the ba sis for feature extraction. Fea-\nture extractors can also use a work‚Äôs metadata, along with the larger capabilities of the Python language, to add pow-erful classification methods. An example of this is the ComposerPopularity feature, which returns a base-10 loga-rithm of the number of Google hits for a composer‚Äôs name (see Example 3). \ns = corpus.parse('mozart/k155', 2)  \nprint s.metadata.composer \nW. A. Mozart \nfe = features.native.ComposerPopularity(s) \nprint fe.extract().vector \n[7. 0334237554869485] \n38812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nExample 3.  The ComposerPopularity feature extractor re-\nports that there are about 10 million Google results, or ap-\nproximately 107, for the form of Mozart‚Äôs name encoded \nin the version of K155 movement 2 that appears in the \nmusic21  corpus, a collection of approximately ten thou-\nsand works provided with the toolkit. \nSeveral of the native FEMS  are adaptations of jSym-\nbolic extractors, expanded by capabilities offered by other modules in \nmusic21 . For instance, McKay‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù \nfeature classifies a piece as either in major or in minor \nbased on information encoded within the initial key signa-ture of some MIDI files. For files without this information, \nmusic21 ‚Äôs enhancement of this FEM (fea-\ntures.native.QualityFeature) will also run a Krumhansl-\nSchmuckler probe-tone key analysis (with the default Aarden-Essen weightings) [7] on the work to determine the most likely mode. The native module also includes many chord-related \nFEMS  that were proposed by McKay but not \nincluded in the present release of jSymbolic. \n2.3 Writing Custom Feature Extractors \nOne of the strengths of music21 ‚Äôs feature system is the \nease of writing new FEMS . After inheriting the common su-\nperclass FeatureExtractor, new FEMS  can be created and \nused alongside existing FEMS . The core functionality is im-\nplemented in a private method called _ process() , which sets \nthe values of the vector of an  internally stored Feature ob-\nject. The FeatureExtractor superclass provides automatic access to a variety of presentati ons of the score, from a flat \nrepresentation (using the .flat property) to a reduction as \nchords, along with  histograms of commonly requested mu-sical features such as pitch class or note duration. These \nrepresentations are cached for quicker access later as keys on a property called data (such as self.data['chordify']). The \nobject also allows direct acce ss to the source score through \nthe stream property. \nExample 4 creates a new feature extractor that reports \nthe percentage of notes that  contain accident als (including \ndouble sharps and flats, but excluding naturals) that are not B-flats. This feature could he lp chart the in creased usage \nover the course of the Renaissance of musica ficta , that is, \nchromatic notes beyond B-flat  (the only accidental common \nto Medieval and Renaissance music). \n# Feature Extractor definition \nclass MusicaFictaFeature( \n             features.FeatureExtractor):  name = 'Musica Ficta'  discrete = False  dimensions = 1  id = 'mf'       def _process(self):   allPitches = self.stream.flat.pitches \n  # N.B.: self.data['flat.pitches'] works  \n  # equally well and caches the result for    # faster access by other FEMS. \n  fictaPitches = 0   for p in allPitches:    if p.name == \"B-\":     continue    elif p.accidental is not None \\      and p.accidental.name != 'natural':     fictaPitches += 1   self._feature.vector[0] = \\      fictaPitches / float(len(allPitches))  \n# example of usage of the new method on two pieces # (1) D.

A custom feature extractor to find musica fic-\nta, applied to an early 15th-century Gloria and a late 16th-\ncentury madrigal. \n3. MULTIPLE FEATURE EXTRACTORS AND \nMULTIPLE SCORES \nSince the previous examples ha ve extracted single features \nfrom one or two scores, similar results could have just as well been obtained through the object model or analytical routines of the \nmusic21  toolkit. But machine learning \ntechniques require a large group of scores and many fea-\ntures. The features module shines for such studies by mak-ing it easy and, through caching, fa st to run many scores (or \nscore excerpts) through many \nFEMS , and to graph the results \nor output them in the formats commonly used by machine learning programs. \n3.1 Extracting Information from DataSets \nThe DataSet object of the features module is used for clas-\nsifying a group of scores by a particular class value using a set of \nFEMS . Its method addFeatureExtractors()  takes a list \nof FEMS  that will be run on the data. (For ease of getting a \nlarge set of FEMS , each feature extractor has a short id \nwhich allows it to be found by the method extractorsById() . \nThe special id ‚Äúall‚Äù gets all feature extractors from both na-\ntive and jSymbolic libraries.) The addData() method adds a \nmusic21  Stream [1] (i.e., a score, a part, a fragment of a \nscore, or any other symbolic musical data) to the DataSet, \noptionally specifying a class va lue (such as the composer, \nwhen the task at hand is cla ssifying composers) and an id \n(such as a catalogue number or file name). For conven-ience, addData() can also take a string containing a file \npath to the data (in any of several formats), a URL to the score on the internet, or a re ference to the work in the \nmu-\n389Poster Session 3\n  \n \nsic21  corpus. Example 5 sets up a DataSet to run three \nFEMS related to note length on f our pieces: two by Bach, \none by Handel, and an ‚Äúunknown‚Äù  work (also by Handel).  \nIf a file has been read in on ce and is unmodified since the \nlast reading, its parsed vers ion is cached in a Python ‚Äúpick-\nle‚Äù file for quicker reading in subsequent runs. \nds = features.DataSet(classLabel='Composer') \nfes = features.extractorsById(['ql1','ql2','ql3']) ds.addFeatureExtractors(fes)  b1 = corpus.parse('bwv1080', 7).measures(0,50) ds.addData(b1, classValue='Bach', id='artOfFugue') ds.addData('bwv66.6.xml', classValue='Bach') ds.addData('c:/handel/hwv56/movement3-05.md',                classValue='Handel') ds.addData('http://www.midiworld.com/midis/other/handel/gfh-jm01.mid') ds.process() \nExample 5 . Setting up and processing a DataSet with \nthree FEMS  and four scores. \nExtracting the data from a DataSet is simple once pro-\ncess() has been called.  The simplest way of getting the \noutput of multiple feature ex tractors is through DataSet‚Äôs \nwrite() method, which can take a filename or a file format \n(if no file path is given, a file is saved to the user‚Äôs ‚Äútemp‚Äù directory). File formats are speci fied as strings that call the \nappropriate OutputFormat object. \nMusic21  comes with \nOutputFormats for comma-separated values (csv), tab-\ndelimited output (tab) for Orange, and Attribute-Relation File Format (arff) for Weka. The OutputFormat object is \nsubclassable, so additional formats for R, Matlab, native Excel (an .xls reader/wr iter is packaged with \nmusic21 ), or \njson (for Java, Max/MSP, or other systems) can easily be \ndeveloped.  \nOther ways of obtaining extracted features include \nDataSet‚Äôs getFeaturesAsList() method, which returns a list \nof lists, one list of feature results for each piece, and getString(), which returns the data as a single string in any \nof the supported formats. If the optional Python package Matplotlib is installed, the data can also be graphed from within \nmusic21 . Finally, because the DataSet is fully inte-\ngrated with the rest of the t oolkit, specific Streams can be \nexamined in notation. Exampl e 6 takes the DataSet object \nfrom Example 5 and examines it in several ways.  Part (a) writes it out as an comma-separat ed file; (b) prints the at-\ntribute labels; (c) gets the entire feature output as a list of lists and prints one line of it; (d) displays the entire feature data in OrangeTab output. Part (e) examines the feature vectors and displays as pngs (via Lilypond) any scores where the most common note value is an eighth note (length = 0.5); the resulting output contains the two Handel scores. Part (f) plots the last  two features (most common \nnote length and the prevalence of that length) for each \npiece. \n (a) \nds.write('/usr/cuthbert/baroqueQLs.csv') \n \n(b) \nprint ds.getAttributeLabels() \n['Identifier', 'Unique_Note_Quarter_Lengths', \n'Most_Common_Note_Quarter_Length', 'Most_Common_Note_Quarter_Length_Prevalence', 'Composer'] \n \n(c) \nfList = ds.getFeaturesAsList() \nprint fList[0] \n['artOfFugue', 15, 0.25, 0.6287328490718321, 'Bach'] \n \n(d) \nprint features.OutputTabOrange(ds).getString() \nIdentifier Unique_Note‚Ä¶ Most_Common‚Ä¶ Most_Com..Prevalence Composer \nstring discrete continuo us continuous discrete \nmeta    class artOfFugue 15 0.25 0.628732849072 Bach bwv66.6.xml 3 1.0 0.601226993865 Bach hwv56/movem‚Ä¶ 7 0.5 0.533333333333 Handel http://www.mid... 14 0.5 0.768951612903  \n \n(e) \nfor i in range(len(fList)): \n  if fList[i][2] == 0.5:     ds.streams[i].show('lily.png') \n[HWV 56 3-5, from the Messiah ] \n \n[‚ÄúMourn ye afflicted Children,‚Äù from Judas Maccabaeus] \n \n(f) \np = graph.PlotFeatures(ds.streams, \n           fes[1:], roundDigits = 2) p.process() \n \nExample 6. Viewing the contents of a DataSet object. \n39012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n3.2 Using Feature Data for Classification \nOnce the DataSet object has been  plotted or viewed as mu-\nsical data to check the results for obvious errors, then the outputted data can be fed into any number of standard data mining packages for analyses su ch as clustering or classifi-\ncation. The package Orange (http://orange.biolab.si) inte-grates well with \nmusic21  since it provides a Python inter-\nface to its classification algor ithms (in addition to having a \nGUI); other toolkits such as Weka [5] can also easily be \nused. Below, we include sample code for using Orange, but the results of Examples 8 and 9 were produced in Weka. Complete code examples, along with our sample data, can be found in the demos directory in the \nmusic21  distribu-\ntion.   \n4. DEMONSTRATIONS AND RESULTS \nWe end this paper with two demonstrations of the power of \nfeature extraction in music21  to enable automatic classifi-\ncation of musical styles and composers from symbolic data \nencoded in many formats. The first example uses 24 pitch- and rhythm-based feature extractors (p1‚Äì16, 19‚Äì21, and r31‚Äì35) to classify monophonic folksongs from four files in the Essen folksong database as being from either China or Central Europe (mostly Germany). Two files, folkTrain.tab and folkTest.tab , are created according to the \nsame model as Example 5. (Full source for this part of the example is available in the \nmusic21  distribution as de-\nmos/ismir2011/prepareChinaEurope().) The files contain \n969 and 974 songs, respectively, and the extractors de-scribed above result in 174 feat ures, although about half are \ndiscarded during preprocessing b ecause they have the same \nvalue for every song.  \nExample 7 applies two classification methods (or \nlearners) to the pair of data files, using the songs in the first file for training the classifier and those in the second for testing (i.e., validating) the classifier‚Äôs predictions. The first method, MajorityLearner, simply chooses the classification that is most common in the training data (e.g., for the data in Examples 5-6, it would label the unknown data as Bach, because Bach is represented tw ice as often as Handel in the \nlabeled data), and thus reports  a baseline accuracy for other \nclassification methods to be measured against. The second method, k-nearest neighbors (k NN) [12], assigns to each \ntest example the majority label among the k most similar \ntraining examples. After assigni ng an origin to each song in \nfolkTest, the program consu lts the correct answer or \n‚Äúground truth,‚Äù and in the end it prints the fraction of songs correctly labeled by each cla ssifier: 69% for the baseline \n(MajorityLearner) and over 94% for kNN. The perfor-mance of kNN over MajorityLearner stands only to in-crease with the development,  in the near future, of \nFEMS \nmore suited to the nuances of folk music. \n import orange, orngTree \ntrainData = orange.ExampleTable('/folkTrain.tab') testData  = orange.ExampleTable('/folkTest.tab')  majClassifier = orange.MajorityLearner(trainData) knnClassifier = orange.kNNLearner(trainData)      majWrong = 0 knnWrong = 0      for testRow in testData:   majGuess = majClassifier(testRow)   knnGuess = knnClassifier(testRow)   realAnswer = testRow.getclass()   if majGuess == realAnswer:     majCorrect += 1   if knnGuess = realAnswer:     knnCorrect += 1     total = float(len(testData)) print majCorrect/total, knnCorrect/total \n0.68788501026694049 0.94353182751540043 \nExample 7. Using data output from the features module of \nMusic21  to classify folksongs in Orange. \n \nIn Example 7, the training and testing data are split approx-imately 50-50. We can increase both the amount of data used to train the models and the number of predictions they make by using a technique called 10-fold cross-validation. Example 8 shows the results of doing this, on the same da-ta, using a variety of classifiers in Weka.  \nClassifier Accuracy \nMajority (baseline) 63% \nNa√Øve Bayes 79% \nNa√Øve Bayes (using supervised         discretization option) 91% \nDecision tree 93% \nLogistic regression 95% K-nearest neighbor (using k = 3) 96% \nExample 8. Accuracy of classifiers for distinguishing \nChinese from Central Eu ropean folk music. \nWhile kNN was the best classifier in all our experi-\nments, decision tree-based cla ssification systems [2] can be \nhelpful for users wishing to understand how a classifier  decides which features are important. Example 9 shows a decision tree built to distinguish  the vocal works of Bach \nand Monteverdi. Given a data  set of 46 works from each \ncomposer, and the same features used previously, the clas-sifier has selected just 6 f eatures as informative when \nbuilding this tree. (In a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, trees like this achieved about 86% classification accuracy.)  \nAlthough it is not always possible to explain the algo-\nrithm's choices intuitively, some of them make sense upon examination. For example, although Monteverdi uses sharped notes, he does not ever use sharps in his key signa-tures, and thus sharped notes remain uncommon in his pieces. The decision tree picks up on this predilection in its \n391Poster Session 3\n  \n \ntop-level split, the single most informative rule learned (fi-\nnal line of Example 9): if mo re than 14.4% of the piece‚Äôs \nnotes are MIDI note 54 (F#3), then the piece is by Bach (true all 30 out of 30 times in the data set).  \n \nBasic_Pitch_Histogram_54 <= 0.144578 | Initial_Time_Signature_0 <= 3: Bach (4.0) | Initial_Time_Signature_0 > 3 | | Range <= 32: Bach (6.0) | | Range > 32 | | | Basic_Pitch_Histogram_64 <= 0.05: Bach (3.0) | | | Basic_Pitch_Histogram_64 > 0.05 | | | | Basic_Pitch_Histogram_60\n <= 0.921569: Monteverdi (47.0/1.0) \n| | | | Basic_Pitch_Histogram_60 > 0.921569 | | | | | Relative_Strength_of_Top_Pitches <= 0.96875: Bach (4.0) | | | | | Relative_Strength_of_Top_Pitches \n> 0.96875: Monteverdi (2.0)  \nBasic_Pitch_Histogram_54 > 0.144578: Bach (30.0) \nExample 9. Decision tree algorithm applied to distinguish \nBach and Monteverdi ‚Äôs choral pieces. \nThe results of these classification tests of folk and baroque \nmusic demonstrate music21 ‚Äôs utility in automatically de-\ntermining musical style from a score without human inter-\nvention. Sophisticated style analysis tools open up oppor-tunities in other areas, such as more accurate notation and \nplayback. For instance, a program could choose appropriate instruments for digital performance depending on the esti-mated location in which the piece was composed: fiddles for Irish jigs, kotos and sh≈ç for Japanese folk music. By \nlowering the barriers to using feature extraction, \nmusic21  \ncan bring the fruits of MIR to a wide audience of computer \nmusic professionals.  \n5. FUTURE WORK \nThough these tools are extremely powerful already, the de-\nvelopment of new FEMS in music21  and application of the-\nse features to the classification of musical scores is still in \nits infancy. The authors and the music21  community will \ncontinue to add new feature extractors to solve problems \nthat range from assigning composer names to anonymous works of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, to genre classi-fication of popular music leadsheets. to charting the slow change in use of chromatic harmony in the nineteenth cen-tury. More sophisticated data mining tools such as support vector machines and clustering algorithms can be explored to improve the accuracy of the classification methods. The newest releases of \nmusic21  can take audio data as input; \nthus we hope to combine MIR of symbolic music data with \nfeature extraction methods applied to audio files, inching closer to the goal of creating software for sophisticated mu-sical listening. \n6.

INTRODUCTION\nKaraoke is a form of singing entertainment found world-\nwide, which enables anyone to sing like a professional. Karaoke\nmachines not only provide backing music for singing, but\nalso evaluate the singer‚Äôs voice as another entertaining fea-\nture. Studies of analyzing the singing voice have been mak-\ning progress. For example, Nakano et al. reported good re-\nsults of a system for classifying ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúpoor‚Äù singing\nbased on SVM [2]. Mayor et al. proposed a categorization\nand segmentation system for singing voice expression using\npre-deÔ¨Åned rules and HMM [1]. In this paper, we describe\nour attempt to develop a new service for karaoke: a system\nfor evaluating the singer‚Äôs enthusiasm.\nBy ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù, we mean how eager the singer is to\nsing. The term ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù for singing a song as used\nin this paper is a translation of the Japanese word nessho ,\nwhich literally means ‚Äúhot singing‚Äù and is often used for ex-\npressing the energy of a singer‚Äôs performance. As karaoke\nis the entertainment for amateur singers, we believe that\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc‚Éù2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.singing skill is not the only aspect worth evaluating because\npoor singers can never get a high score. However, even poor\nsingers can sing enthusiastically, so we focused on this as-\npect. We consider that a system which evaluate singing en-\nthusiasm would be an exciting service for amateur karaoke\nusers.\nSinging enthusiasm is similar to the emotion of music\n[3], especially the ‚Äúarousal-calm‚Äù aspect. However, there\nare signiÔ¨Åcant differences between enthusiasm and emotion.\nFirst, enthusiasm is not an expressed emotion. Karaoke is\nbasically a form of self-entertainment, and most karaoke\nsingers who sing enthusiastically are not trying to convey\ntheir enthusiasm to the audience but are just enjoying them-\nselves. Also, enthusiasm is not an induced emotion, because\na listener who listens to an enthusiastically-sung karaoke\nsong does not necessarily become excited. In our opinion,\nenthusiasm is more like an attitude of singing, rather than an\nemotion.\nAs our study on objectively evaluating enthusiasm was a\nnew attempt, there were several issues to investigate:\n‚Ä¢Is a feeling of ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù shared by many listeners?\n‚Ä¢Is enthusiastic singing also perceived to be ‚Äúenthusi-\nastic‚Äù by listeners?\n‚Ä¢What are the physical features related to enthusiasm?\n‚Ä¢How can we build a system that evaluates enthusiasm\nautomatically?\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and\n3, we describe the procedures and results of analyzing a\nsinging voice corpus and subjective evaluations, and show\nthat humans can perceive enthusiasm appropriately. In Sec-\ntion 4, we describe our method for choosing acoustic fea-\ntures of a singing voice and discuss the efÔ¨Åciency of each\nfeature. In Section 5, we describe an overview and evalua-\ntions of the system.\n31Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\n2. SINGING VOICE CORPUS\n2.1 Selection of a Song\nFor this Ô¨Årst study on singing enthusiasm using a simple and\nreliable scheme, we decided to use just one pop song for all\nthe experiments. ‚ÄúItoshi no Ellie‚Äù by the Southern All Stars\n(which was covered as ‚ÄúEllie My Love‚Äù by Ray Charles)\nwas Ô¨Ånally selected as it satisÔ¨Åed the following conditions:\n‚Ä¢Not too difÔ¨Åcult for amateur singers to sing both ‚Äúen-\nthusiastically‚Äù and ‚Äúnormally‚Äù i.e., no extremely high,\nlow or long notes.\n‚Ä¢Well known by all the singers and human subjects of\nthe subjective evaluation (Japanese, in our research).\nAll the recordings should be in the same key because dif-\nferences of key may affect the subjective evaluations. Con-\nsidering the vocal range of amateur singers, we chose to use\nC-Maj. transposed from the original key of D-Maj. As a\nresult, the lowest note is E3 and the highest is G4 for male\nsingers (it can be an octave higher for female singers). The\ntempo is 69-70 bpm.\n2.2 Recording Procedures\nThirty-four singers participated in the recording, none of\nwhom were professional singers. The sound accompani-\nment, which had been directly recorded using a karaoke\nmachine beforehand, was played through headphones and\nthe singers sang along to it. The singers sang into a mi-\ncrophone on a stand with a pop-Ô¨Ålter attached to prevent\nhandling noise and pop noise. The singers were instructed\nnot to move much during the recording and stay almost a\nconstant distance from the microphone. In order to obtain\nvarious voices with a wide range of enthusiasm and to label\nsingers‚Äô intended enthusiasm to each voice, they were each\nasked to sing two times, once ‚Äúenthusiastically‚Äù and once\n‚Äúnormally‚Äù. The singers themselves could choose in which\nstyle to sing Ô¨Årst, and informed us before they sang.\nThe voices were recorded at 44.1-kHz/16-bit sampling in\na soundproof chamber.\n3. SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS\nWe conducted subjective evaluations for the following three\npurposes: (1) investigate whether humans can perceive singing\nenthusiasm using the same criteria, (2) investigate whether\nlisteners can distinguish whether singers sang enthusiasti-\ncally or not, and (3) investigate listeners‚Äô intuition about the\nenthusiasm, and obtain clues for choosing acoustic features\nfor automatically evaluating singing enthusiasm.\nFigure 1 . Stimuli for subjective evaluations (parenthesized\nwords are English words)\nEvaluation word Value\nenthusiastic 2\nneither selected 1\nnot enthusiastic 0\nTable 1 . Evaluation words and the values for the subjective\nevaluations\n3.1 Stimuli\nFor the subjective evaluations, we chose short stimuli (about\n1.5 to 9 seconds) from the recordings to facilitate the decision-\nmaking. Figure 1 shows the prepared stimuli.\nIn this study, the absolute sound-pressure level (SPL) is\nof no interest because the SPL depends on not only the mag-\nnitude of a singer‚Äôs voice but also the distance between the\nsinger and the microphone. As our method should be ap-\nplied to karaoke machines, it is difÔ¨Åcult to measure the mag-\nnitude of the singer‚Äôs voice precisely, so we decided to ex-\nclude the effect of absolute SPL, even though our prelimi-\nnary experiment proved that absolute SPL is important for\nperception of enthusiasm. All the stimuli were normalized\nto the same power after passing through a high-pass Ô¨Ålter\n(80 Hz cut-off) to reduce low-frequency noise.\nAs Figure 1 shows, two sets of stimuli were prepared. Set\nA was a collection of 272 stimuli of a phrase that appears\nfour times in the song with the same melody and the same\nlyrics, and set B was a collection of four varieties of phrases,\neach of which was sung 68 times. (B1) is the beginning of\nthis song, (B2) is from the early part, (B3) is from the middle\npart (the bridge or the climax) and (B4) is from the last part.\n3.2 Evaluation Procedure\nFor each set of stimuli, 30 human subjects were asked to\nlisten to the stimuli, and selected one of three evaluation\nwords for each stimulus. Table 1 shows the evaluation words\n3212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nand the associated values. Evaluations were conducted for\neach set of stimuli using the same procedure as follows:\n1. The subjects listened to the stimuli through headphones\nin a soundproof chamber and the volume was Ô¨Åxed for\nall the subjects.\n2. For training, the subjects evaluated 20 stimuli selected\nat random.\n3. The subjects evaluated 100 stimuli for three times.\nThe stimuli were selected so that each stimulus was\nevaluated by almost the same number of subjects. The\nstimuli used in the training phase were excluded.\n4. After the evaluation, the subjects Ô¨Ålled in a question-\nnaire about the vocal features they felt relevant to en-\nthusiasm.\nAfter the evaluation, one stimulus had 30 to 36 evaluation\nvalues given by 10 or 12 subjects. We took the average of\nall evaluation values, and the average was regarded as the\nresult of the subjective evaluation for that stimulus.\n3.3 Results\nIn order to investigate whether the subjects perceived singing\nenthusiasm consistently, we examined the correlation be-\ntween the evaluation values given by a subject and the aver-\nage of those given by all the other subjects.\nLetxsi‚àà {0,1,2}be an evaluation value for stimulus s\ngiven by the i-th subject. Let ¬Øxsibe\n¬Øxsi=1\nNs‚àí1/summationdisplay\njÃ∏=ixsj (1)\nwhere Nsis the number of subjects who evaluated the stim-\nuluss. Then calculate œÅi, which is the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient\nbetween xsiand¬Øxsiwith respect to s. IfœÅiis high, it means\nthat the i-th subject evaluated the stimuli in the same way as\nthe other subjects. Note that we calculated œÅifor sets A and\nB independently, which are represented by œÅA\niandœÅB\ni.\nFigure 2 is a histogram of œÅA\niandœÅB\ni. This Ô¨Ågure shows\nthat the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients are more than 0.7 for most\nof the subjects, so it is reasonable to suppose that the sub-\njects perceived singing enthusiasm consistently. We can\nalso observe that the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients for set B are\nhigher than those for the set A. This difference was caused\nby phrase-by-phrase differences in enthusiasm. Set A con-\ntained only one phrase, while set B had four phrases taken\nfrom different parts of the song. Different parts of the song\nhad different enthusiasm; for example, phrase B1 (the Ô¨Årst\npart) had smaller subjective evaluation values than phrase\nB3 (the hook line), which matches our intuition.\nNext, we investigated the relationship between ‚Äúintended\nenthusiasm‚Äù and ‚Äúperceived enthusiasm.‚Äù In this experi-\nment, we asked singers to sing the song with two degrees\nFigure 2 .

Average of subjective evaluation for different\nsinging styles (the error bars represent the standard devia-\ntion)\nof enthusiasm: ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, to see whether\nthis ‚Äúintended enthusiasm‚Äù could actually be perceived by\nthe subjects or not. To answer this question, we calculated\nthe average of subjective evaluation values for the two ‚Äúin-\ntended enthusiasm‚Äù sets. The results are shown in Figure 3.\nThe paired Wilcoxon-signed rank test revealed signiÔ¨Åcant\ndifferences ( p<0.01) for both sets A and B, indicating that\nthe subjects could distinguish the ‚Äúintended enthusiasm‚Äù by\nlistening to the voice.\nFinally, we asked the subjects to describe the features\nof the singing voice that they felt were relevant to the per-\nception of enthusiasm. Table 2 summarizes the features re-\nported by the subjects. As the goal of this questionnaire was\nto identify acoustic features for automatically evaluating en-\nthusiasm, we excluded opinions that were not related to the\nacoustic aspect of singing.\n4. ACOUSTIC PARAMETERS\nWe examined several acoustic features for automatically eval-\nuating enthusiasm based on the results of the questionnaire.\nThe fundamental frequencies (F0) were extracted at 10-ms\nintervals using The Snack Sound Toolkit [4], and converted\ninto log-scale (cent scale).\n33Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nloud voice\nstrong attack\nsudden rise in loud voice\nloud voice on high notes\narticulated dynamics\nstrong articulation of each note\nscooping up the pitch at the beginning\npitched on key\npitched higher than the correct note\nstable pitch\nvoice with vibrato\nenthusiastic forceful voice\nshouting voice\nbright voice\nhoarse voice\nkeeping forced voice until just before the release\nclearly pronounced lyrics\narticulated consonants\nstrong breath sounds\nportamento\nsome improvisation of rhythm\nsome improvisation of melody\ngetting into the rhythm\nsoft voice\nmonotonous voice\npitched clearly off key\npitched lower than the correct note\nnot forceless voice\nenthusiastic dark voice\nmufÔ¨Çed voice\nbreathy voice\nreleased in short\nnot getting into the rhythm\nTable 2 . Factors relevant to enthusiasm listed in the ques-\ntionnaires\n4.1 Examined Features\nFirst, we focused on the loudness of the voice. Some sub-\njects reported that they felt the ‚Äúloud voice‚Äù was more enthu-\nsiastic, although all the stimuli were normalized to the same\npower. We guessed that this happened because the stimuli\nhad different loudness levels. As the loudness depends not\nonly on the power of the signal but also on its frequency, the\n‚Äúloud voice‚Äù might have larger loudness even though the\nphysical power of all stimuli were equal. To investigate the\nrelationship between loudness and enthusiasm, we calculate\nthe A-weighted power of the stimuli, and examined a cor-\nrelation between the A-weighted power and the enthusiasm.\nWe used the A-weighted power instead of the loudness be-\ncause it can be calculated more easily, and is widely used in\nacoustic measurements such as sound level meters. We de-\nsigned an FIR Ô¨Ålter which implements the A-weighting [6]\nshown in Figure 4, and calculated the power of the signals\nin dB after applying the Ô¨Ålter.\nSecond, we focused on the change of power. There were\nseveral opinions on the change of sound power, such as\n‚Äústrong attack‚Äù or ‚Äústrong articulation of each note.‚Äù We\nexamined the Ô¨Årst derivatives of sound power ( ‚àÜpower) of\nFigure 4 . A-weighting curve\nthe voices as a physical feature expressing change of sound\npower, and took the maximum values for the feature. The\n‚àÜpower was computed by\n‚àÜP(n) =/braceleftBiggn0/summationdisplay\nk=‚àín0P(n+k)k/bracerightBigg\n/n0/summationdisplay\nk=‚àín0k2(2)\nwhere P(n)is the power at the n-th frame and n0is the\nnumber of side frames. The conditions were decided by\nthe preliminary experiment: the frame size was 20 ms, the\nframe shift was 10 ms and the number of side frames was 4.\nThird, we examined features related to F0 change at the\nbeginning or end of a phrase. From the questionnaire, opin-\nions concerning F0 change were observed such as ‚Äúscoop-\nup‚Äù pitch at the beginning of phrases. Figure 5 shows an\nexample of F0 with scoop-up and fall-down. Observing F0s\nof recorded voices, we found some of them were scoop-\ning up at the beginning, and some were falling-down at the\nend of phrases. The durations were within about 250 ms\nfor both, and the frequency extent was under about 2000\ncent for scoop-up, and under about 900 cent for fall-down.\nThese features were described by Mayor et al. [1] as kinds\nof singing expressions, however no researches have revealed\nthe relevance of the features to human perception of the\nsinging voice.\nAs an acoustic feature that expresses these kinds of F0\nchange, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE)\nvalue of F0 in regions of a constant duration, using Eq. (3):\nERMS(ts, T) =/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt1\nTts+T‚àí1/summationdisplay\nt=ts(Fmax(ts, T)‚àíF0(t))2(3)\nFmax(ts, T) = max\n0‚â§t<TF0(ts+t) (4)\nwhere F0(t)is the fundamental frequency of the t-th frame,\ntsis the beginning time of the calculation region, and Tis\nthe length of the region. The duration Twas 200 ms. Here,\na phrase is deÔ¨Åned by a region not shorter than 500 ms with\n3412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncontinuous F0. We calculate two RMSE values correspond-\ning to scoop-up and fall-down:\nEup=ERMS(tS, T) (5)\nEdown=ERMS(tE‚àíT, T) (6)\nwhere tSandtEare the beginning and end of the phrase,\nrespectively.\nFinally, we examined vibrato-related features. Vibrato\nis one of the most basic features of the singing voice, and\nmany studies have revealed its acoustic features. The results\nof the questionnaire suggested that vibrato is an important\nfactor relevant to human perception of enthusiasm.\nTo detect vibrato, we computed ‚Äúvibrato likeliness‚Äù pro-\nposed by Nakano et al. [2] Short-time Fourier transforma-\ntion with a 32-point (320 ms) hanning window was applied\nto‚àÜF0(t)which is the Ô¨Årst-order Ô¨Ånite differential of F0(t).\nThe amplitude spectrum X(f, t)is expected to have a\nsharp peak range in the vibrato rate. Vibrato likeliness Pv(t)\nis deÔ¨Åned by Eq. (9) using the power Œ®v(t)and the sharp-\nnessSv(t).\nŒ®v(t) =RH/summationdisplay\nf=RLÀÜX(f, t) (7)\nSv(t) =RH/summationdisplay\nf=RL|‚àÜfÀÜX(f, t)| (8)\nPv(t) = Œ® v(t)Sv(t) (9)\nwhere ÀÜX(f, t)isX(f, t)normalized over f, and‚àÜfÀÜX(f, t)\nis the Ô¨Årst-order derivative of ÀÜX(f, t)with respect to f.RL\nandRHare 5 and 8 Hz, respectively. Then we detect vibrato\nwhen Pv(t)is higher than a threshold and F0(t)crosses its\nregression line more than Ô¨Åve times, as shown in Figure 6.\nWe derived three parameters of vibrato: (1) the rate Vr\n[Hz], (2) the extent Ve[cent], and (3) the ratio of time with\nvibrato in all the vocal regions Vtcalculated as follows:\nVr=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=11\n2ri(10)\nVe=1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1ei (11)\nVt=1\ntF0N/summationdisplay\ni=1ri (12)\nwhere N,ri, and eiare as shown in Figure 6 and tF0is the\ntotal time of detected F0. However, if ( Vr<5orVr>8) or\n(Ve<30orVe>150), the values were discarded because\nsuch values are likely to be caused by Ô¨Åne F0 Ô¨Çuctuation or\nanalysis error. Note that the three vibrato parameters are 0\nfor voices when no vibrato is detected.\nFigure 5 . An example of scoop-up and fall-down\nFigure 6 . Calculation of vibrato-related feature\n4.2 Results\nAs an evaluation of acoustic features, we calculated the cor-\nrelation coefÔ¨Åcient between individual features and the aver-\nage human evaluation of enthusiasm. The results are shown\nin Table 3. From these results, we picked up three features\nthat had relatively high correlations for both sets A and B:\nA-weighted power, Edown, and Ve.\nThe maximum ‚àÜpower and Eupgave only low correla-\ntion for set B. All of the three vibrato-related features gave\nrelatively high correlation because the correlation between\nthese three features are high (from 0.70 to 0.88), therefore\nwe chose only one of these features.\nThe A-weighted power gave the best correlation among\nthe examined features. From our observation, the A-weighted\npower seemed to be related to the quality of voice. The voice\nwith high A-weighted power did not only sounded louder\nbut also gave a clear and rich impression. The A-weight\nampliÔ¨Åes the frequency range around 3 kHz, which coin-\ncides with the frequency of the singing formant [5]. The A-\nweighted power and existence of the singing formant may\nbe related, but the singing formant was not necessarily ob-\nserved clearly in the voice even when the voice had high\nA-weighted power.\n5. SINGING ENTHUSIASM EVALUATION SYSTEM\n5.1 System Overview\nBased on the observations described in the previous section,\nwe constructed the Singing Enthusiasm Evaluation System\n35Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nSet A Set B B1 B2 B3 B4\nA-weighted power 0.47 0.54 0.36 0.50 0.51 0.49\nMax.‚àÜpower 0.23 -0.22 0.05 0.13 -0.10 -0.09\nEup 0.20 0.07 -0.09 0.21 0.14 -0.12\nEdown 0.35 0.36 0.13 0.38 0.29 0.50\nVibrato time Vt 0.37 0.30 0.42 0.25 0.30 0.36\nVibrato extent Ve 0.37 0.37 0.38 0.27 0.38 0.47\nVibrato rate Vr 0.37 0.37 0.39 0.29 0.38 0.47\nTable 3 . Correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between acoustic parame-\nters and subjective evaluations\n(SEES), as outlined in Figure 7. The SEES consists of three\nsubsystems: SEES front-end, core and back-end.\nThe SEES front-end consists of a high-pass Ô¨Ålter for noise\nreduction, signal power normalizer, and F0 extractor. The\nSEES core is the main part of the system, and extracts the\nacoustic features: the A-weighted power, the RMSE for fall-\ndown and the vibrato extent. The SEES back-end is the\npart where Ô¨Ånal evaluation values are computed by linear\nsum features. The multiplier coefÔ¨Åcients correspond to the\nweights of the features and they must be determined before-\nhand. In our experiment, the coefÔ¨Åcients were determined\nby a multiple linear regression analysis on set A using the\nsubjective evaluation values as the response variables and\nfeature values as the explanatory variables.\n5.2 Evaluation of the System\nFinally, we evaluate the system by comparing the system‚Äôs\noutput with the human evaluation values. Set A was used as\na training set for determining the multiplier coefÔ¨Åcient. We\nexamined both sets A and B for testing the system, which\ncorresponded with the closed test and open test, respectively.\nThe results are shown in Figure 8. The correlation coefÔ¨Å-\ncients between the system output and the human evaluation\nwere 0.60 for set A (closed test), and 0.65 for set B (open\ntest). We obtained good correlations not only for set A but\nalso for set B, so we consider the system will produce stable\nevaluations for various melodies and lyrics.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we introduced ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù as an aspect of\nevaluating the singing voice for karaoke, and obtained the\nfollowing results by experiments.\nFirst, subjective evaluations revealed that humans per-\nceive singing enthusiasm almost consistently, and listeners\ncan distinguish whether singers are singing enthusiastically\nor not only by listening to the voice.\nSecond, questionnaires revealed three effective acoustic\nfeatures of voices: the A-weighted power, the RMSE for\nfall-down and the vibrato extent.\nFinally, we developed a singing enthusiasm evaluation\nFigure 7 .

INTRODUCTION \nMusic is an inherent part of nearly all broadcast p ro- \ngrammes (TV and radio) and is often used to heighte n the \naffective content of a scene or programme.  Program me \nmaking teams have access to vast ‚Äòproduction music‚Äô  librar- \nies, which provide detail of not only the music tra cks title \nand composer, but also keywords about the music whi ch \ndescribes it‚Äôs mood. This production music is used as back- \ning music within a programme; providing an accompan i- \nment to a scene.  The British Broadcasting Corporat ion \n(BBC) provide internal access to a service called ‚Äò Desktop \nJukebox‚Äô a production music library which contains over \n38,000 production tracks along with a range of affe ctive de- \nscriptors such as ‚Äòconfident‚Äô, ‚Äòbright‚Äô or ‚Äòsensiti ve‚Äô.  This is \nan invaluable tool for helping programme producers to \nchoose the right music as an accompaniment to a par ticular \nscene. Yet music is not just used as a background i n pro- \nductions.  Most programmes also contain a theme tun e ‚Äì a piece of music designed to be recognizable and iden tifiable \nto introduce the programme.  Generally especially c ommis- \nsioned, these pieces of music convey some idea of t he affec- \ntive content of the upcoming programme ‚Äì a precurso r to \nset the tone.  For example, in preparation for the coverage \nof the 2010 UK General Election coverage, the BBC \nbriefed the composer Blair-Oliphant that he should com- \npose music that was ‚Äúserious, important and classy‚Äù  to re- \nflect the fact that ‚Äúthis is likely to be a fairly historic elec- \ntion‚Äù[1]. \nIn this paper we present our mass participation ex-\nperiment Musical Moods that explored the link betwe en \ntheme tune and affect.  Members of the public were asked \nto listen to theme tunes spanning 60 years of the B BCs out- \nput from 1950  and across 10 different genres, and rate each \none on an affective differential scale.  In the exp eriment, \n144 theme tunes from 135 different programmes were made \navailable as some long running programmes had multi ple \ntheme tunes.  The breakdown of programmes, theme tu nes \nand responses by genre is shown in table 1.  \nEach participant listened to a maximum of five \ntheme tunes, chosen at random per experiment.  Afte r one \nmonth of the experiment being live, 13,183 particip ants had \nauditioned and ranked 51, 374 themes.   \n The aim of this experiment is to help develop \nautomatic systems to classify the BBC archive using  affec- \ntive metadata.  Currently all BBC programmes that a re \nlikely to be reused (either through re-broadcast or  as clips) \nhave manually created metadata, contents of which r ange \nfrom brief synopses to detailed shot listings.  Thi s results in \nLondon Classification (LonClass) database entry.  L on- \nClass, a Universal Decimal Classification extension  devel- \noped by the BBC, is designed specifically to give f actual \ninformation about a programme such as genre, shot t ype or \nrecording location. Some programmes also have more in-\ndepth analyses consisting of a full transcription a nd shot \nlisting.  However, this is a time and resource expe nsive \nprocess; a detailed analysis of a 30 minute program me can \ntake a professional archivist 8 to 9 hours. \nThe purpose of this manually generated metadata \nis to allow for professional reuse. Frame accurate metadata \nis designed to allow users such as producers, and r esearch- \ners to find stock shots such as landscapes or peopl e, key in- \nterviews or other clips. However as the BBC open up  their \n741Poster Session 6\n  \n \narchives, this level of detail or type of metadata may not be \nbest suited for non-professional users: viewers.  \n \nGenre Number of \nProgrammes \n(percentage \nof total) Number of \ntheme \ntunes  \n(percentage \nof total) Number of \nresults  \n(percentage \nof total) \nChildren‚Äôs 16 (11.8%) 19 (13.2%) 6836  \n(13.3 %) \nComedy 33 (24.4%) 33 (23.0%) 11786  \n(22.9%) \nDrama 38 (28.1 %) 40 (27.8%) 14204 \n(27.6%) \nEntertainment 21 (15.6%) 22 (12.3%) 7867 \n(15.3%) \nFactual 7  (5.2%) 8 ( 5.6%) 2769 \n(5.4%) \nLifestyle 8 (5.9%) 8 (5.6%) 2882 \n(5.6%) \nNews 7 (5.2%) 8 (5.6%) 2912 \n(5.7%) \nSoaps 3 (2.2%) 3 (2.1%) 1047 \n(2.0%) \nSports 2 (1.5%) 3(2.1%) 1071 \n(2.1%) \nTable 1.  Breakdown of theme tunes, genres and results re- \nceived.   \nBBC Information and Archives (BBC I&A), the \nsection of the BBC that archive programmes and crea te as- \nsociated metadata, periodically release digitised c ollections \nof programmes online to the UK viewing public [2]. These \ncollections are grouped by theme and have semantic meta- \ndata; programme title, original transmission date, contribu- \ntors and a brief synopsis; metadata similar to that  in Lon- \nClass.  This allows a user to accurately find what factual \ninformation is contained within a programme.  This method \nof indexing may not be suitable when a viewer is lo oking \nfor a programme for entertainment, not information.   Thus, \nsome form of semantic or affective metadata is requ ired. \n BBC Research and Development (R&D) are cur- \nrently investigating automatic classification techn iques [3].  \nThese aim to create semantic and affective metadata  from \nan archived programme through an analysis of the av ailable \naudio and video or a programme.  Current analysis t ech- \nniques focus on non-music audio ‚Äì speech and sound ef- \nfects.  The purpose of collecting metadata about th eme \ntunes is to extend this to begin investigating how well music \ncan aid automatic classification.  Theme tunes are used to \nidentify a programme; making it recognizable to the  audi- \nence and setting up affective expectations.   By af fectively analysing the theme tune, we hope to be able to aid  in an \naffective analysis of an entire programme.  \n In this paper we present our work as follows.  We \npresent an overview of the experiment and our metho dology \nis given in section two and an initial analysis of our results \nin section three.  We discuss these results in sect ion four \nand conclude and present our plans for the future i n section \nfive. \n2.  METHODOLOGY \nMusical Moods was an online experiment, accessible from \nthe URL www.musicalmoods.org.uk.  The experiment wa s \nlaunched as part of the British Science Association ‚Äôs Na- \ntional Science and Engineering Week, a yearly event  in the \nUK with the aim of promoting participation in and t he un- \nderstanding of science in the UK.  The experiment w as also \nfeatured on the BBC television show, Bang Goes The The- \nory, a weekly science show with an average audience  of \naround 2.5 million.  \nOne of the key factors in this experiment was ease \nof use for participants.  As such, each participant  on hearing \na clip of a theme tune was asked to rate a theme tu ne on one \nof the possible six semantic differentials.  The cl ip was 15-\n20 seconds long, with the participants able to re-a udition \nthe theme tune if required.  These clips were edite d to en- \nsure they contained the main musical themes of the theme \ntune, and did not contain any lyrics which alluded to the TV \nshows content.  Participants were played five rando mly \nchosen theme tunes in each experiment.  Participant s could \ntake part in the experiment as many times as possib le and \nno record was made of how many times a participant took \npart.  Upon hearing a clip, the participants were a sked to \nrate each semantic differential on a discrete scale  of one to \nfive, with each scale extreme labelled with an oppo sing pair \nof adjectives.   \n2.1  Semantic Differentials \nOne of the key issues found with previous music and  affect \nresearch is the lack of a standard definition for s emantic \nscales.  Hevner was one of the first to attempt to define a \ntaxonomy for music and affect [4].  This creates ei ght \ngroups of adjectives arranged diametrically on a ci rcle.  \nAnother approach is to use a valence/arousal space similar \nto that defined in [5].  The semantic differentials  in this ex- \nperiment were based upon Osgood‚Äôs dimensional space ; a \nthree dimensional space incorporating Evaluation, P otency \nand Activity (EPA) [6].   Each of these allow mappi ngs be- \ntween different adjectives that have similar affect ive mean- \ning allowing for affective unification of them.  Ev aluation \nrelates to positive or negative feelings like happy  or sad and \naccounts for around 50% of affective meaning.  Pote ncy \nrelates to size or power, such as heavy or light an d activity \nrelates to amount of action. Potency and activity c ount for \napproximately the other 50% of semantic meaning, al though \n74212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nthere are 4 more minor categories. The affective ad jectives \nused in this experiment were taken from mapping adj ectives \nin [4] to the affective space in [6].  The semantic  differen- \ntials were happy/sad, playful/serious for evaluatio n, mascu- \nline/feminine and heavy/light for potency and dra- \nmatic/relaxing, exciting/calm for activity.  A scor e of one to \nfive was used for these, with five relating to a ma ximum \nvalue of happy, playful, masculine, heavy, dramatic  and ex- \nciting and one relating to a maximum score for the opposing \nadjectives although this numbering was not shown to  the \nuser.  The adjective scales used for each EPA diffe rential \nwere found to correlate to each other, as is shown in table1.  \nHere, a Pearson Correlation matrix shows the correl ations \nbetween the different semantic differentials.  Idea lly there \nwould be high correlation between semantic differen tials in \nthe same affective vector space (i.e. dramatic corr elating \nhighly with exciting .

Pearson Correlation  for Affective Results \n2.2  Genre Identification \nParticipants were then asked to identify with which  genre \nthey associated the music clip.  The options for ge nres were \ntaken from an amended list to that on the BBC iPlay er ser- \nvice, an online programme catch-up facility availab le in the \nUK [7].  These were Children‚Äôs, Comedy, Drama, Ente r- \ntainment, Factual, Lifestyle, Soaps, News and Sport .  The \npurpose of this was to look at the link between the me tune \nand genre ‚Äì looking to identify if genres were read ily identi- \nfiable from theme tunes and also if there was any l ink be- \ntween the affective score and perceived genre. \n2.3  Liked or Familiar \nParticipants were also asked either if they liked a  theme \ntune, on a scale of ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, ‚ÄòNo‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo Opinion‚Äô or  how \nfamiliar they were with a theme tune, on a scale of  ‚ÄòVery‚Äô,  \n‚ÄòNot Very‚Äô and ‚ÄòSort of‚Äô.  A very familiar or liked  tune \nscored one and a unfamiliar or not very liked tune scoring \n1.  The purpose of asking these was to ascertain if  there was \nany link between familiarity and liking a theme tun e, with \nthe affective score given.  This was not done to ra nk theme tunes by popularity or find out which were the best  known \ntheme tunes. \n3.  RESULTS \nAfter over 51,000 results had been gathered a preli minary \nanalysis was performed.  Results were calculated by  collat- \ning all the scores for each of the 144 programmes.  The av- \nerage and standard deviation for each answer was th en cal- \nculated.  To calculate the EPA values, each semanti c differ- \nential for each of evaluation, potency and activity  was com- \nbined, with equal weighting.  The average and stand ard de- \nviation of each of these was then calculated. \n3.1  Participation \nOf the 13,183 participants who took part in the exp eriment,  \n54% of participants identified themselves as female  and \n46% male.  Age band results are shown in table 3. \n \nAge Band  Percentage \n< 16 44% \n16 ‚Äì 24 18% \n25-39 18% \n40-54 14% \n55-69 5% \n > 70 2% \nTable 3.  Age band breakdown of participants \n3.2  Affective Scores \nThese results looked at how different theme tunes w ere \nclassified according to the semantic differentials of evalua- \ntion, potency and activity.  These are shown in fig ures 2, 3 \nand 4 respectively.   \nFigure 2 shows the average evaluation score \nagainst the average potency.  Here, it can be quite  clearly \nseen that across all theme tune genres there is a s light nega- \ntive correlation of -0.2 between the potency of a t heme tune \nand the evaluation (shown as a line), meaning tunes  classi- \nfied as happy are also broadly classified as light.   Also, \nwhilst genres do spread over the range of the scale , there is \na tendency for theme tunes associated with children ‚Äôs (‚Äò+‚Äô) \nand comedy (‚Äòo‚Äô) programmes to rate higher on evalu ation \nand for those associated with dramatic (‚Äò*‚Äô) progra mmes to \nrate higher on the potency scale. \n \nIn Figure 3, the average potency against the averag e activity \nis shown for each programme.  A positive correlatio n  of \n0.6 is shown between activity and potency meaning t heme \ntunes perceived as heavier are also perceived as mo re excit- \ning.  Also, whilst clustering is less visible than figure 2, \nthere is some, with theme tunes associated with dra ma (‚Äò*‚Äô) \ntending to rate higher on potency and activity (i.e . more \ndramatic and heavy) with theme tunes accompanying c hil- \ndren‚Äôs and comedy programmes (‚Äò+‚Äô and ‚Äòo‚Äô respectiv ely) \ntending to be less so (i.e. slightly calmer and lig hter), \n743Poster Session 6\n  \n \nthough children‚Äôs programming does tend towards bei ng \nmore exciting. \n \n \nFigure 2.  Potency and evaluation average classifications \n \n \nFigure 3.  Activity and potency average classifications \nFigure 4 shows no real correlation overall, but doe s show \nsome clearer grouping.  One of the most interesting  group- \nings shown is that for theme tunes accompanying new s and \ncurrent affairs programmes (circled on figure 4).  These can \nbe seen to cluster around the centre scale for eval uation, but \nwith a marked increase in activity meaning that the y are \nclassified as being neither happy nor sad but more dramatic. \n \n \nFigure 4.  Activity and evaluation average classifications 3.2.1  Standard Deviation \nIn all instances, it was found that the standard de viation was \nsignificantly lower at the extremes of each semanti c scale.  \nThis is shown in figure 5. \n \n \nFigure 5.  Standard deviation for semantic differentials \n3.3  Genre, liking and familiarity \nThese looked at the results from the familiarity, h ow much \nparticipants liked a theme tune and genre identific ation \nquestions. \nUnsurprisingly, when participants were more fa- \nmiliar with the theme tune, they were generally abl e to iden- \ntify the accompanying programmes genre.  The result s for \ncorrectly identified programmes are shown in figure  6. \n \n \nFigure 6.  Genre classifications. \n \nAn interesting result from this genre classificatio n is that \nparticipants did not seem to be able to correctly i dentify \nwhich genre a theme tune accompanied with only soap s be- \ning correctly identified more than 50% of the time.   Partici- \npants also had most trouble identifying lifestyle p ro- \ngrammes where only 35% of participants who stated t hey \nknew the theme tune being correct and 22% of those who \nstated they knew the theme tune incorrectly choosin g enter- \ntainment.  A further error was in factual genre ide ntification \n74412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nwhere 23% of participants who did not know the them e tune \nidentified the programme as factual and 24% as dram a. \nAs can be seen from figure 7, theme tunes which \nwere more familiar to people were also rated as bei ng more \nliked, with one key exception, the theme tune to th e pro- \ngramme the Weakest Link , where the theme tune is less fa- \nmiliar to participants, but liked.  Familiarity and  a value for \nliking was found to have a correlation coefficient of 0.69.  \nHowever, familiarity was not seen to have a marked differ- \nence on  the affective scores, with only a 7% diffe rence \nnoted between the scores of familiar and unfamiliar  theme \ntunes. \n \n \nFigure 7. Familiarity against Likedness for Programme \naverages \nAll results and music will be available for downloa d from \nwww.musicalmoods.org . \n4.  DISCUSSION \nFrom the results analysed so far some clear trends are visi- \nble.  As figure 2 shows, there is a negative correl ation be- \ntween potency and evaluation.  This suggests that t unes \nclassified as happy or playful were also classified  as light or \nfeminine.  When the genres of the programmes associ ated \nwith the theme tunes is taken into account, this sh ows that \nthese are generally genres which one would imagine as be- \ning happy or light ‚Äì mainly children‚Äôs, comedy and lifestyle \nprogrammes.  This genre generally includes day-time  TV \nprogrammes about home improvements or gardening and  so \nagain this is expected.  However, no large scale af fective \nanalysis of the programmes has so far been conducte d and \nso no strong link can as yet be drawn.  At the othe r end of \nthe scale, where theme tunes are classified as bein g heavier \nand sadder, mainly dramas are found.  This would fi t in \nwith our understanding of drama programmes themselv es ‚Äì \nthat they generally feature ‚Äòheavier‚Äô and less happ y story- \nlines.  A brief analysis of the programmes by the a uthors \nwhose theme tunes were found to have the lowest eva lua- \ntion and highest potency scores found the overall a ffect of \nthe programmes (the detective shows  Silent Witness and  Ashes to Ashes ) found they also fitted into the same affec- \ntive space . Conversely the two programmes which were \nfound to have the highest evaluation scores and the  lowest \npotency scores were found to be both children‚Äôs TV pro- \ngrammes; Blue Peter , a children‚Äôs magazine programme \nand the Teletubbies , a show aimed at pre-school children.  \nFrom the authors analysis of these programmes, it c an be \nseen that programmes such as these which have theme  tunes \nwhich score at extremes of the affective scales the mselves \nwould score highly at these extremes too. \nIn figure 3 a clear correlation between activity an d po- \ntency is visible, meaning that theme tunes classifi ed as be- \ning more dramatic and exciting (activity) are also classified \nas being heavier and more masculine (potency).  How ever \nin this case much less grouping is observed.  Where as in \nfigure 2 it was possible to see groupings in the ge nres chil- \ndren‚Äôs and comedy and then a further group for dram atic \nprogrammes, here both children‚Äôs, comedy and drama are \nspread along the scales.  Theme tunes to the genres  comedy \nand drama have classifications at both extremes of the scale.  \nThis is unsurprising when considering the affective  nature \nof programmes.  Genre‚Äôs such as comedy and drama re ly far \nmore on affect for their programme substance than f act \nbased programmes such as factual or news which rely  more \non their informative content.  From this, it follow s that the \ntheme tunes to children‚Äôs, comedy and drama program mes \nshould have more affective spread.  The correlation  be- \ntween activity and potency allows follows the findi ngs in \n[6], which found that there was a high degree inter change- \nability between them.  \nLooking at the results shown in figure 4 there is n o \ncorrelation shown between activity (dramatic or cal m) and \nevaluation (playful or serious) shown in TV theme t unes.  \nTherefore no link was found between theme tunes bei ng \nhappy or playful, and how dramatic or exciting they  were \nfound to be.  However it is possible to see groupin gs of the \ngenres of the programmes associated with the theme tunes \nmore clearly.  For example, children‚Äôs, comedy and lifestyle \nand entertainment all tend to group towards the hig her end \nof the evaluation scale.  Conversely, theme tunes a ssociated \nwith drama tend towards the lower end of the evalua tion \nscale, indicating a more sad or serious classificat ion.  One \ninteresting cluster is that of theme tunes associat ed with \nprogrammes of the genre news, circled on figure 4.  These \ncluster around the centre of the evaluation axis, s uggesting \nthat in terms of happy or sad they are neutral.  Ho wever, \nthese have the largest standard deviation (with an average \nof 1.2) so it could be that with classifying these types of \ntheme tunes participants had the most trouble. \nWhat is most interesting in looking at the genres a sso- \nciated with the theme tunes is that whilst some cle ar group- \ning occurs, individual genres spread out over seman tic dif- \nferential scales.  From this, it is possible to con clude that \nusing these affective values are not an accurate me thod for \nclassifying genre i.e. children‚Äôs programmes do not  all clas- \n745Poster Session 6\n  \n \nsify as happy.  This is further backed up by lookin g at the \nresults shown in figure 6.  Here, it can be seen th at, in gen- \neral, participants were not that accurate in associ ating gen- \nres and theme tunes.  Even when participants stated  they \nwere very familiar with the theme tune, the highest  percent- \nage of correct genre identification was only 57% (f or \nsoaps). The lowest score was for factual at 29% and  the av- \nerage correct identification rate was only 44%.  Wh en the \nresults for those who were not familiar with the th eme tune \nare taken into account, correct identification fall s even fur- \nther with the most correct classifications being fo r the News \ngenre, with 54% correct classifications and the low est for \nFactual with 23%.  The average was 37%.  This again  sug- \ngests that the genre of a programme and its associa ted \ntheme tunes affective value do not show a strong li nk.  This \nwould have important implications in the design of any \nclassification and recommendation system that looks  to use \ngenre and affect as a basis. \nOne of the problems with this could be the choice o f \ngenres that were made available.  These were based on \nthose offered by the BBC iPlayer service.  These ar e very \nbroad categories, with some ambiguity as to which g enres \nsome programmes belong too (for example between pro - \ngrammes in the  entertainment and lifestyle genre) and with \nmany programmes placed in multiple categories (for exam- \nple children‚Äôs news programmes).  Further research is re- \nquired to identify what genre classification system  best \nmaps to affect. \nIn looking at figure 6, it is clear that there is a  positive \ncorrelation between the average value for liking a tune and \nfamiliarity with it.  This suggests that the more f amiliar \ntheme tunes were also more liked by participants.  Whilst \nthis in itself does not give any insight into how e ither liking \na theme tune or being familiar with one has an effe ct on \nhow participants affectively perceive a theme tune,  it does \nsuggest that when evaluating retrieval systems for pro- \ngramme archives, this correlation should be noted. One in- \nteresting outlier in this set is the theme tune to the enter- \ntainment programme The Weakest Link  ‚Äì a quiz show where \nthe familiarity is slightly below average but the t une has a \nhigh value for being liked.  Further analysis is re quired to \ndetermine possible causes for this. \n5.  CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK \nIn this paper we have presented our experiment Musi cal \nMoods and our first analysis of the results.  We ha ve found \nthat whilst some the genres of the TV programmes wi th \nwhich theme tunes are associated show some grouping  on \nthe affective scales, there is no real link between  a pro- \ngrammes genre and the perceived affective value of its \ntheme tune.  We have also found that theme tune alo ne is \nnot an accurate indication of programme genre.  A f urther \nfinding is there is strong correlation between fami liarity and \nliking a theme tune. Further work is also designed to musically analyse the \ntheme tunes and correlate these with the experiment  results.  \nIt is planned to perform a full musical analysis on  each track \nused ‚Äì looking at features including key, harmonic progres- \nsion, instrumentation and orchestration.  These wou ld then \nbe analysed against the affective scores for the th eme tunes.  \nThis would then be used as a ground truth dataset, looking \nto use automated musical analysis and machine learn ing \ntechniques to identify the affective content of oth er pro- \ngramme theme tunes.   \nAnother area of work is to affectively analyse the pro- \ngramme themselves, and look at any correlation betw een \nthe affective classification of the video and audio  content \nwith the theme tune.  This is planned through more large \nscale user evaluations. \nWe are also looking to get more participants to in-\ncrease the validity of our results. \n6.

INTRODUCTION\nRecently, the Laboratory for the Recognition and Organiza-\ntion of Speech and Audio (LabROSA)1of Columbia Uni-\nversity released a large dataset of music consisting of audio\nfeatures and metadata for one million songs, aptly named\nthe ‚ÄòMillion Song Dataset‚Äô [4].\nBecause the dataset is almost completely labeled, it lends\nitself well for developing and testing classiÔ¨Åcation methods.\nIn this paper, we attempt to classify songs according to their\ngenre, artist and key. To this end, we design a convolutional\nnetwork that summarizes the input features over musically\nsigniÔ¨Åcant timescales.\n1http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Developing techniques that can harness the entire dataset\nis quite a challenge. We use the majority of the data in an\nunsupervised learning phase, where the network learns to\nmodel the audio features. Due to its size, the dataset is very\nsuitable for unsupervised learning. This is followed by a\nsupervised training phase, where only a small task-speciÔ¨Åc\nsubset of the dataset is used to train a discriminative model\nusing the same network. We have investigated the gains that\ncan be achieved by using a convolutional architecture, and\nthe additional gains that unsupervised pretraining can offer.\nThis paper is structured as follows: the layout of the\ndataset is detailed in Section 2. An introduction to convo-\nlutional deep belief networks (DBNs) follows in Section 3.\nSection 4 describes the classiÔ¨Åcation tasks that were used to\nevaluate the model. Section 5 provides an overview of our\napproach, and Section 6 describes our experimental setup.\nResults are given in Section 7.\n2. DATASET\n2.1 The Million Song Dataset\nThe Million Song Dataset is a collection of all the infor-\nmation that is available through The Echo Nest API2for\none million popular songs. This means that a lot of the\ndata was automatically derived from musical audio signals,\nwhich should be taken into account when it is used for learn-\ning. Metadata available includes artist and album informa-\ntion and the year of the performance. Musical information\nderived directly from the audio signal includes the key, the\nmode and the time signature. Next to this, some other de-\nrived features like ‚Äúenergy‚Äù and ‚Äúdanceability‚Äù and user-\nassigned tags are also available.\nThe audio features in the dataset were obtained by Ô¨Årst\ndividing each song into so-called segments. Segment bound-\naries roughly correspond to onsets of notes or other musical\nevents. For each segment, a feature vector consisting of 12\ntimbre and 12 chroma components was computed, as well\nas the maximal loudness within the segment.\nThe chroma features describe the pitch content of the mu-\nsic. Each of the 12 components corresponds to a pitch class\n2http://the.echonest.com/\n669Poster Session 6\n(ranging from CtoB). Their values indicate the relative\npresence of the pitches, with the most prominent one al-\nways having a value of 1. All components lie within the\ninterval [0,1]. The timbre features are the coefÔ¨Åcients of 12\nbasis functions which capture certain timbral characteristics\nlike brightness, Ô¨Çatness and attack. They are unbounded and\nroughly centered around 0.\nUnfortunately, the automated methods used to build the\ndataset lead to the presence of a relatively large number of\nduplicate tracks. When the dataset is divided into a train and\na test set in a naive fashion, some examples might occur in\nboth subsets, which is undesirable. Luckily, the authors of\nthe dataset have published an extensive list of known dupli-\ncates. Using this list, over 78,000 tracks were removed.\n2.2 Beat-aligned Features\nAlthough the segmentation that was performed to compute\nthe audio features has its merits, we are more interested in\nbeat-aligned features such as those used in [3]. The beat\nis the basic unit of time in music. Chord progressions and\nchanges in musical texture tend to occur on the beat, and\nseeing as it is one of our goals to encode these characteristics\nin higher level features, it makes sense to use beat-aligned\nfeatures as a starting point.\nThe features from the dataset can be converted to beat-\naligned features using the rhythm information that is also\nsupplied. The segments are mapped to beats, and then the\nfeature vectors for all segments corresponding to the same\nbeat are averaged.\n3. CONVOLUTIONAL DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS\n3.1 Deep Learning\nA fairly recent trend in machine learning is the use of deep\narchitectures, with many layers of processing [1]. Tradition-\nally, such architectures were not very popular because they\nwere very difÔ¨Åcult to train. In 2006, Hinton demonstrated\na fast training method for deep belief networks (DBNs), a\nparticular type of deep models [11]. This led to a surge in\npopularity of these models, establishing deep learning as a\nnew area of research.\nThe popularity of deep architectures can be attributed at\nleast partially to their biological plausibility; humans typi-\ncally use hierarchies and abstractions to organize their thoughts\nand evidence of hierarchical structures has been found in the\nbrain (e.g. in the visual cortex [1]).\nDeep belief networks are probabilistic generative mod-\nels, which are obtained by stacking multiple restricted Boltz-\nmann machines (RBMs) on top of eachother.3.2 Restricted Boltzmann Machines\nA restricted Boltzmann machine is a probabilistic model\nconsisting of a set of visible units and a set of hidden units\nwhich form a bipartite graph; there are no connections be-\ntween pairs of visible units or pairs of hidden units, but ev-\nery visible unit is connected to every hidden unit. They are a\nkind of undirected graphical model. A schematic represen-\ntation is shown in Figure 1.\nThe visible units of an RBM correspond to the input vari-\nables of the data that is to be modelled. In image processing,\neach visible unit typically represents one pixel. The hidden\nunits capture correlations between visible units and can be\nseen as feature detectors . The model learns the underlying\ndistribution of the data by representing it in terms of features\nthat are derived from the data itself.\nEach connection has a particular weight, and each of the\nunits can also have a bias. These trainable parameters can be\nlearnt from data. Unfortunately, maximum likelihood learn-\ning is intractable in RBMs. Instead, the contrastive diver-\ngence learning rule, which is an approximation to maximum\nlikelihood learning, can be used [9].\nFigure 1 . Schematic representation of an RBM, with the\nvisible units at the bottom and the hidden units at the top.\nNote how there are no lateral connections between two vis-\nible or two hidden units.\nRBMs typically consist of binary units, which can be on\nor off. This makes sense for the hidden units, which are\nfeature detectors, but it is not always the best choice for the\nvisible units. It is also possible to construct an RBM for\ncontinuous data, with Gaussian visible units.\n3.3 Deep Belief Networks\nA deep belief network (DBN) consists of multiple RBMs\nstacked on top of eachother, with the hidden units of RBM i\nbeing used as visible units of RBM i+ 1. The bottom RBM\nlearns a shallow model of the data. The next one then learns\nto model the hidden units of the Ô¨Årst, and so on: higher-level\nfeatures are extracted from lower-level features. Each RBM\nis trained separately; learning would be considerably harder\nif all layers would be trained jointly using backpropagation.\nTop-level features learnt by DBNs can be used to train\ndiscriminative models. In this fashion, they have been ap-\nplied succesfully to image processing problems like hand-\n67012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwriting recognition [11] and object recognition [12], but\nalso to classiÔ¨Åcation of audio signals [14], and even music\nclassiÔ¨Åcation [8]. For a detailed technical overview of deep\nlearning, RBMs and DBNs, see [1].\n3.4 Convolutional Networks\nA convolutional networks is a type of network model with\nconstrained weights. There are two kinds of constraints:\n‚Ä¢locality: each unit in layer iis only connected to a group\nof units in layer i‚àí1that is local;\n‚Ä¢translation invariance: each unit in layer iis replicated\nsuch that every local group of units in layer i‚àí1is con-\nnected to a unit in layer iwith the same weight conÔ¨Ågu-\nration ( weight sharing ). A set of units in layer iwith the\nsame weight conÔ¨Åguration is called a feature map .\nThis conÔ¨Åguration is visualized in Figure 2.\nIn layered network models, we typically wish for higher\nlayers to represent higher levels of abstraction. Weight con-\nstraints in convolutional networks would make it hard for\nneurons in higher layers to learn high-level abstractions; they\nonly see a small local portion of the input, whereas high-\nlevel abstractions usually involve long-range dependencies.\nTo increase the scope of higher layer neurons, convolutional\nlayers are alternated with max-pooling layers.\nMax-pooling is a downsampling operation: units in layer\niare grouped into small non-overlapping blocks. Each block\nis aggregated into a single unit in layer i+ 1, with as its\nactivation the maximal activation over all units in the block.\nThis operation reduces the dimensionality of the data by a\nfactor equal to the size of the blocks. This layout is also\nshown in Figure 2.\nIt‚Äôs clear that inserting max-pooling layers between con-\nvolutional layers increases the scope of higher layer neu-\nrons. Furthermore, it also makes the model invariant to\nsome small displacements of the input data, increasing its\nrobustness.\nlayer i+ 1\nlayer i\nlayer i‚àí1\nFigure 2 . A max-pooling layer ( i+ 1) stacked on top of a\nconvolutional layer ( i). Note that layer i‚àí1and layer iare\nnot fully connected. The connections are drawn in different\nstyles to indicate which weights are shared.\nConvolutional networks are typically used for image pro-\ncessing, where stronger correlations between nearby pix-els and the translation invariance of image features are ex-\nploited to signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the number of parameters.\nAudio signals have similar characteristics, although the lo-\ncality is temporal rather than spatial.\nDeep belief networks can be made convolutional by ap-\nplying the described weight constraints in the RBM layers,\nand inserting max-pooling layers between the RBM layers.\nConvolutional deep belief networks have been have been\nused for object recognition [13, 16], and to extract features\nfrom audio signals, for speech recognition as well as for mu-\nsic classiÔ¨Åcation [14].\n3.5 Supervised Finetuning\nAs mentioned earlier, we can use top-level DBN features\nas input for a classiÔ¨Åcation method; common choices are\nsupport vector machines or logistic regression. We can train\na logistic regression classiÔ¨Åer by gradient descent, using the\nDBN to preprocess the input data.\nIt is also possible to convert a DBN into a convolutional\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP). We can simply reuse the weights\nof the interconnections and the biases of the hidden units.\nWe then stack a logistic regression layer on top of this MLP\nand train the whole model jointly using gradient descent.\nThis approach is called supervised Ô¨Ånetuning : the DBN weights\nthat were initially learnt to model the data are now Ô¨Ånetuned\nfor a speciÔ¨Åc discriminative task using backpropagation.\n4. TASKS\nWe performed several classiÔ¨Åcation tasks on music tracks:\nartist recognition, genre recognition and key detection. La-\nbeled datasets for each of the tasks were extracted from the\nMillion Song Dataset. Three (partially overlapping) subsets\nwere selected:\n‚Ä¢artist recognition: the 50 artists with the most tracks in\nthe dataset were identiÔ¨Åed, and 100 tracks of each artist\nwere selected (5000 tracks in total);\n‚Ä¢genre recognition: 20 common genres were selected man-\nually using tags3that are included in the dataset: folk,\npunk, metal, jazz, country, blues, classical, rnb, new wave,\nworld, soul, latin, dance, reggae, techno, funk, rap, hip\nhop, rock and pop. For each genre, 250 tracks were se-\nlected (5000 tracks in total);\n‚Ä¢key detection: the key information in the dataset was au-\ntomatically annotated, so it may be unreliable. To avoid\nproblems with incorrect labels, we selected 250 tracks\nwith a high key conÔ¨Ådence for each of the 12 possible\nkeys (3000 tracks in total).\nThe subsets were then divided into balanced train, evalu-\nation and test sets according to a 80% / 10% / 10% split.\n3The dataset provides different kinds of tags. We used the MusicBrainz\ntags because these are the most reliable [4].\n671Poster Session 6\n5. APPROACH\nWe built a convolutional network, designed to aggregate the\nfeatures from the dataset on musically signiÔ¨Åcant timescales.\nProperties that are typical for certain genres, artists or keys,\nshould become apparent at this level. We used the same net-\nwork to tackle all three classiÔ¨Åcation tasks.\nThe network was Ô¨Årst trained as a DBN on the entire Mil-\nlion Song Dataset4. We then trained and evaluated the net-\nwork as an MLP with backpropagation, for each of the clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation tasks. We used the Theano Python library to im-\nplement all experiments, so they could be GPU-accelerated\neasily [2].\n5.1 Network Layout\nThe input of the network consists of beat-aligned chroma\nand timbre features for a given track, so there are 24 input\ndimensions in total. The maximal loudness component was\nnot used, as the timbre features already include a loudness\ncomponent. Note that tracks vary considerably in length, but\nthe convolutional nature of the network allows us to cope\neasily with variable-length input.\nFirst, we separated the chroma and timbre features into\ntwo input layers (layers 0a and 0b). Then, separate convo-\nlutional layers were stacked onto both input layers (layers\n1a and 1b). These layers learn features with a width of 8\nbeats. It was observed that most of the tracks in the dataset\nhave a 4/4 time signature (which is also true for contempo-\nrary music in general). This means that there are 4 beats in\na bar. The width of the features was chosen to be two bars,\nseeing as this is the timescale on which chord progressions\nand changes in musical texture are most likely to occur. We\nused 100 feature maps for each layer.\nBy using separate layers, the network does not learn cor-\nrelations between chroma and timbre features at this level.\nThis allows it to focus on learning correlations between tim-\nbre components and between chroma components separately;\nsuch correlations are likely to be easier to discover. A simi-\nlar approach was used in [15] to learn features over multiple\nmodalities.\nThe output of the convolutional layers was then max-\npooled in the time dimension with a pool size of 4 (layers 2a\nand 2b). Once again, we made use of the observation that\nmost of the tracks in the dataset have a 4/4 time signature,\nwith 4 beats per bar; the output of the max-pooling layer is\ninvariant to all displacements of less than one bar (up to 3\nbeats).\nThe max-pooled outputs of both layers were then con-\ncatenated, yielding 200 features with a granularity of ap-\nproximately 1 bar. We stacked another convolutional layer\nwith 100 feature maps on top of this, which learns features\n4Excluding known duplicates and tracks used for validation and testing\nfor any of the tasks.with a width of 8 bars (layer 3). This width was selected\nbecause musical themes are often contained within a length\nof 8 bars. Correlations between timbre and chroma compo-\nnents can now be discovered as well.\nFinally, another max-pooling layer with a pool size of 4\nwas added (layer 4). The features obtained from this layer\nhave a granularity of 4 bars and a scope of roughly 8 bars.\nTo perform the classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, a Ô¨Åfth layer perform-\ning logistic regression was added. To classify a track, each\ntimestep of the layer 4 is classiÔ¨Åed separately, and the result-\ning posterior distributions over the class labels are averaged.\nThe most probable class is then selected. The layout of the\nnetwork is shown in Figure 3.\nbeatsbarsthemes5: logistic regression\n4: max-pooling\n3: convolution\n2a: max-pooling\n1a: convolution\n0a: chroma features2b: max-pooling\n1b: convolution\n0b: timbre features 12 12100 100100 100100100\nFigure 3 . The network layout. The number of dimensions\nor feature maps for each layer is indicated on the side. The\nlayers have also been grouped according to the timescale on\nwhich they operate.\n5.2 Unsupervised Pretraining\nIt would be impossible to train the network in a supervised\nfashion with the entire Million Song Dataset. This is this\ncomputationally infeasible, and on top of that the provided\nlabels are not perfect; some are missing, others are incorrect\nor have a very low conÔ¨Ådence.\nAs mentioned before, we pretrained the network using\ntimbre and chroma features for all tracks in the dataset. We\nused the beat-aligned chroma features directly as inputs to\nthe network; the timbre features were Ô¨Årst normalized per\ntrack to have zero mean and unit variance.\nTo train the RBM in layer 1b (timbre), we use Gaussian\nvisible units, which allow for the continuous input data to\nbe modeled. For layer 1a (chroma), we used binary units.\nTechnically, this is not possible because the chroma features\nare continuous values that lie between 0and1. However,\nwe can interpret these values as probabilities and sample\nfrom them, yielding binary input data. In practice, we do\nnot perform this sampling explicitly, but we use the mean\n67212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nÔ¨Åeld approximation (see Section 5.2.2). Learning is much\nmore stable for binary units than for Gaussian units, so be-\ning able to use binary units is a signiÔ¨Åcant advantage.\nWe used single step constrastive divergence (CD-1) ev-\nerywhere. A learning rate of 0.005 was used to train the\nRBMs with binary visible units; a learning rate of 0.0001\nwas used for the RBM with Gaussian visible units. We per-\nformed only a single run through the entire dataset; perform-\ning multiple epochs turned out to be unnecessary (and would\nrequire too much computation time).\n5.2.1 Sparsity\nWe modiÔ¨Åed the hidden unit activations according to [7] to\nencourage them to be sparse. Convolutional RBMs are over-\ncomplete models, so adding a sparsity penalty term ensures\nthat the learnt feature representations are useful [14]. In ad-\ndition, sparse activations are essential for max-pooling to\nwork properly [5, 17].\nWe used a sparsity target of 0.05for layers 1a and 1b,\nand a target of 0.1for layer 3. A relative sparsity cost of 0.1\nwas used in all cases.\n5.2.2 Mean Field Approximation\nWhere possible, we eliminated sampling steps by using the\nmean Ô¨Åeld approximation. This eliminates sampling noise\nand often positively affects convergence. We used this for\nthe chroma inputs and in the contrastive divergence algo-\nrithm, except when updating the hidden states, as recom-\nmended in [10]. Interpreting continuous input values that\nare constrained to a Ô¨Ånite interval as input probabilities to\ntrain an RBM is common practice [9].\n6. EXPERIMENTS\nWe trained the network as a convolutional MLP for each of\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation tasks described in Section 4: Ô¨Årst with ran-\ndom initialization of the weights, and then using the weights\nlearnt by the DBN (supervised Ô¨Ånetuning), yielding six ex-\nperiments. We tried learning rates of 0.05,0.005and0.0005\nand trained for 30 epochs. To initialize the random weights,\nwe sampled them from a Gaussian distribution with a mean\nand variance corresponding to those of the weights learnt by\nthe DBN. This ensures that the results are comparable.\nWe also trained a naive Bayes classiÔ¨Åer and a logistic re-\ngression classiÔ¨Åer that operate on windows of features from\nthe dataset, resulting in six more experiments. We chose a\nwindow size of 32 beats (8 bars), which is comparable to\nthe timescale on which the convolutional network operates.\nFor the logistic regression classiÔ¨Åer, we tried learning rates\nof0.005,0.0005 ,5¬∑10‚àí5,5¬∑10‚àí6and5¬∑10‚àí7and also\ntrained for 30 epochs. Both the chroma features and the tim-\nbre features were normalized to have a zero mean and a unit\nvariance in this case.For each of the twelve experiments, we determined the\noptimal parameters using the validation sets, and then com-\nputed the classiÔ¨Åcation accuracies on the test sets using these\nparameters. The results can be found in Table 1.\n7. RESULTS\nThe Ô¨Årst thing to notice is that the key detection task seems\nto be fairly simple. The achieved accuracies are much higher\nthan for the other tasks, and even the simplest technique per-\nforms quite well. Windowed logistic regression performs\nbest. There are multiple possible explanations for this:\n‚Ä¢the property we are trying to determine is quite ‚Äòlow-\nlevel‚Äô. The key of a track is in a very close relationship\nwith the chroma features and how they evolve through\ntime. Relating the genre or the artist to these features is\nmuch more difÔ¨Åcult;\n‚Ä¢to construct the dataset for this task, we selected tracks\nwith a high key conÔ¨Ådence. This implies that the al-\ngorithm used to annotate key information in the Million\nSong Dataset could identify the key of these tracks with\nrelative ease. It would make sense that the same is true\nfor our models. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify\nthis, except by constructing a manually labeled dataset.\nFor the other tasks, the convolutional network has a deÔ¨Å-\nnite edge over the other approaches: the classiÔ¨Åcation accu-\nracies increase signiÔ¨Åcantly.\nThe gains obtained with pretraining on the other hand\nseem to be much more modest; this is only advantageous for\nthe artist recognition task, which is quite difÔ¨Åcult because it\nis a 50-way classiÔ¨Åcation problem. The utility of pretraining\nfor this task could stem from the fact that the number of\ntracks per class available for training (80) is much lower\ncompared to the other tasks (200). Indeed, it has been shown\nthat gains from unsupervised pretraining are maximal when\nthe amount of available labeled training data is limited [6].\nThis data scarcity is inherent to the task at hand - few artists\nhave a discography with more than 100 tracks.\nThe optimal learning rate for key detection with the con-\nvolutional network differs depending on whether pretrain-\ning is used or not. This is because the training for this task\nwithout pretraining did not converge after 30 epochs using\na learning rate of 0.005. This indicates that convergence\nis faster when pretraining is used. To investigate this, we\nalso compared classiÔ¨Åcation accuracies obtained after only\n20 training epochs, which can be found in the bottom half\nof Table 1. We now observe that pretraining is beneÔ¨Åcial for\nall tasks. This conÔ¨Årms that it improves convergence speed.\n8.

INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have seen a renewed interest in keyboard tem-\nperament both in scholarly work [14] and in more popu-\nlar literature [9]. The modern tuning literature is abundant\nwith detailed speciÔ¨Åcations of hundreds of different key-\nboard temperaments; some are directly taken from historical\nmanuscripts and some are based on reconstruction or specu-\nlation [3,7]. A prescriptive approach taken by some scholars\nand performers regards adherence to speciÔ¨Åc temperaments\nas a desirable aim, and moreover, promotes the notion that\nfor particular styles or even particular pieces there exists the\nE.

An alternative approach, not less\ncommon amongst tuners and performers, is based on the\nview that since temperament is by deÔ¨Ånition a compromise,\nit is primarily a practical matter, and allows room for devia-\ntions from the underlying theoretical constructs. Rather than\nmistakes, such deviations are considered creative solutions\nto constraints arising from different instrument characteris-\ntics, inharmonicity, stylistic preferences, and the combina-\ntions of keys (tonalities) played in a concert programme.\nNot all harpsichord CD sleeve notes specify the temper-\nament, but when they do, there appears to be a tendency\ntoward the former, prescriptive, approach. It is therefore in-\ntriguing to analyse such recordings and explore their adher-\nence to the advertised temperaments. In this work, we anal-\nyse a dataset of over 500 harpsichord recordings for which\ntemperament information is speciÔ¨Åed on the CD sleeve notes,\naiming to shed some light on the relation between tuning\ntheory and tuning practice, and more generally, on the na-\nture of human ‚Äúground truth‚Äù annotations. We extend recent\nwork demonstrating the feasibility of temperament estima-\ntion from solo harpsichord recordings [8,18]. The proposed\nsystem uses a conservative NMF-based automatic transcrip-\ntion algorithm followed by frequency estimation using quad-\nratic interpolation and bias correction. Multiple pitch es-\ntimates for each pitch class are combined with a median\nweighted by the pitch salience output of the transcription\nsystem. Results show signiÔ¨Åcant gaps between advertised\nand actual temperaments, which can be interpreted as evi-\ndence for the more pragmatic approach to tuning.\n2. BACKGROUND\n2.1 Temperament\nFor the last two centuries, the scales used in Western mu-\nsic have been built predominantly upon equal temperament.\nThis situation has been changing since the second half of the\ntwentieth century, as part of the revival of interest in histor-\nical performance practice of early music on period instru-\nments, resulting in increased attention to historical, unequal\ntemperaments. We give a brief introduction to temperament,\nreferring the reader to thorough treatments elsewhere [3, 7].\nExplanations of musical consonance are based on the fact\n281Poster Session 2\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n61\n656161616161F\nBb\nEb\nAb\nDbF#BEADGCSixth Comma Meantone\n51\n51\n51\n51\n51F\nBb\nEb\nG#\nC#F#BEADGCFifth CommaFigure 1 . Circle of Ô¨Åfths representations for 2 temperaments\nused in this paper. The deviation of each Ô¨Åfth from a pure\nÔ¨Åfth (the lighter cicle) is represented by the positions of the\ndarker segments. The fractions specify the distribution of\nthe comma between the Ô¨Åfths (if omitted the Ô¨Åfth is pure).\nthat listeners prefer sounds with harmonic spectra and with-\nout beats [17]. For combinations of harmonic tones, the sen-\nsation of consonance correlates to small integer frequency\nratios between fundamental frequencies, and particularly ra-\ntios of the formn+1\nnwheren‚â§5(corresponding to the\nfollowing pure intervals for successive values of n: octave,\nperfect Ô¨Åfth, perfect fourth, major third and minor third).\nThe two most consonant intervals, the octave (ratio2\n1)\nand perfect Ô¨Åfth (ratio3\n2) correspond to intervals of 12 and\n7 semitones respectively in Western music. From a given\nstarting note, either a succession of 7 octave steps or a suc-\ncession of 12 perfect Ô¨Åfth steps will lead to the same note.\nHowever, (3\n2)12/negationslash= 27, so it is not possible for all of these\nintervals to be pure simultaneously. Temperament refers to\nthe various methods of adjusting some or all of the Ô¨Åfth in-\ntervals (octaves are always kept pure) with the aim of re-\nducing the dissonance in the most commonly used intervals\nin a piece or programme of music. One way of represent-\ning temperament is by the distribution of the ‚ÄúPythagorean\ncomma‚Äù (the ratio (3\n2)12: 27‚âà1.0136 ) around the cycle\nof Ô¨Åfths (see Figure 1). For example, equal temperament\ndiminishes all Ô¨Åfths by1\n12of a comma relative to the pure\nratio 3:2. The other common way to represent temperament\nis by the frequency differences of each pitch class from their\nequal tempered counterparts, which is the representation we\nuse in our results and analysis.\nTheoretical models of temperament ignore the fact that\nstringed instruments are slightly inharmonic. This means\nthat a pure Ô¨Åfth, maximally consonant when the 3rd partial\nof the lower tone coincides with the 2nd partial of the upper\ntone, will not correspond to a fundamental frequency ratio\nof3\n2, as the partials are not precisely at integer multiples of\nthe fundamental. We have shown [8] that this effect is of\nthe order of a fraction of a cent for the harpsichord, which is\nnegligible. The modelling of inharmonicity in the frequency\nestimation step is however important, and this is addressed\nin section 5.2.2 Precise Frequency Estimation\nDespite the vast literature on frequency and pitch detection\n(reviewed in [5, 12]), there is no general purpose method\nsuitable for all signals and applications. Many systems as-\nsume monophonicity, stationarity and/or harmonicity, none\nof which hold for polyphonic harpsichord music, and only\nfew papers address high-precision frequency estimation to a\nresolution of cents, which we require for the present work.\nThe highest precision is obtained using the FFT with quad-\nratic interpolation and correction of the bias due to the win-\ndow function [1], which outperforms instantaneous frequency\nestimation using phase information [18]. Given a local peak\napin the log magnitude spectrum log|X(n,p)|at framen,\nthat is,ap‚àí1< apandap> ap+1, then the three points\n(‚àí1,ap‚àí1),(0,ap), and (1,ap+1)uniquely deÔ¨Åne a parabola\nwith maximum at:\nŒ¥=ap‚àí1‚àíap+1\n2(ap‚àí1‚àí2ap+ap+1)(1)\nwhere‚àí0.5‚â§Œ¥‚â§0.5is the fractional offset from the inte-\nger bin location p. This estimate is further reÔ¨Åned using the\nfollowing formula for bias correction, based on the window\nshape and zero padding factor [1, equations 1 and 3]:\nŒ¥/prime=Œ¥+ŒæzŒ¥(Œ¥‚àí0.5)(Œ¥+ 0.5) (2)\nwhereŒ¥/primeis the bias-corrected offset in bin location, zis the\nzero-padding factor, Œæz=c0z‚àí2+c1z‚àí4is the bias cor-\nrection factor and the constants c0= 0.124188 andc1=\n0.013752 were determined empirically for the Blackman-\nHarris window [1, table 1].\n3. DATA\nThe dataset used for this study consists of 526 tracks from\n22 CDs and the 48 tracks from [18]1. Generally, the CDs\npresent a rather balanced sample of recorded harpsichord\nmusic, including famous and less famous players, and a\nrange of composers including J. S. Bach, D. Scarlatti, F. Cou-\nperin, M. Locke, and J. P. Sweelinck. The CDs provide de-\ntails of the temperament used for the recordings. A few pro-\nvide details of the reference frequency as well (e.g. A = 415\nHz), but this is mostly not speciÔ¨Åed. In some cases the\ntemperament information is precise and unambiguous, as\nin ‚ÄúWerckmeister III‚Äù or ‚ÄúSixth comma meantone with the\nwolf between BandG/flat‚Äù. In other cases it is underspeciÔ¨Åed,\nsuch as with ‚ÄúNeidhardt 1724‚Äù, for which different versions\nexist both in the original manuscripts and in the secondary\nliterature, or with ‚ÄúQuarter comma meantone‚Äù where the\nwolf interval (i.e. the widened Ô¨Åfth) is not speciÔ¨Åed. Some\nunderspeciÔ¨Åcation can be resolved by convention: although\n‚Äúmeantone‚Äù can refer to several different temperaments ‚Äì\ne.g. quarter comma or Ô¨Åfth comma meantone ‚Äì the normal\nuse of ‚Äúmeantone‚Äù without any qualiÔ¨Åcation refers to quar-\nter comma meantone.\n1For details, see http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/ismir11\n28212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4. TRANSCRIPTION\nOur pitch estimation algorithm in Section 5 assumes that\nthe existence and timing of each note is known. There-\nfore a transcription system for solo harpsichord was devel-\noped, using pre-extracted harpsichord templates, NMF with\nbeta-divergence [13] for multiple-F0 estimation, and hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) [16] for note tracking. NMF with\nbeta-divergence is a computationally inexpensive multiple-\nF0 estimation method which has been used for piano tran-\nscription [6]. It has been shown to produce reliable results\nfor instrument-speciÔ¨Åc transcription, being highly ranked in\nthe MIREX 2010 piano-only note tracking task.\n4.1 Extracting Pitch Templates\nFirstly, spectral templates were extracted from three differ-\nent harpsichords, from the RWC musical instrument sounds\ndatabase [11]. For extracting the note templates, the constant-\nQ transform (CQT) was computed with spectral resolution\nof 120 bins per octave. The standard NMF algorithm [15]\nwith one component was employed for template extraction:\nV‚âàwh, where V‚ààRf√ónis the input CQT spectrum,\nw‚ààRf√ó1is the extracted spectral template, and h‚ààR1√ón\nis the component gain (since only one component was set, it\ncorresponds to the frame energy).\nFor template extraction, the complete harpsichord note\nrange was used (F1 to F6). Thus, three spectral template\nmatrices were extracted, W(1),W(2),W(3)‚ààRf√ó61, corre-\nsponding to each harpsichord model.\n4.2 Multiple-F0 estimation\nFor the multiple-F0 estimation step, we used the NMF al-\ngorithm with beta-divergence [13]. The basic model is the\nsame as in the standard NMF algorithm: V‚âàWH, where\nW‚ààRf√ór,H‚ààRr√ón, andris the number of compo-\nnents. The beta-divergences (or Œ≤-divergences) are a para-\nmetric family of distortion functions which can be used in\nthe NMF cost function to inÔ¨Çuence the NMF update rules\nforWandH. Since in our case the spectral template matrix\nis Ô¨Åxed, only the gains Hare updated as:\nh‚Üêh‚äóWT((Wh)Œ≤‚àí2‚äóv)\nWT(Wh)Œ≤‚àí1(3)\nwhere v‚ààRf√ó1is a single frame from the test signal and\nŒ≤‚ààRthe divergence parameter, set to 0.5 for this work,\nas in [6]. Although the update rule (Equation 3) does not\nensure convergence, non-negativity is ensured [6].\nFor the harpsichord transcription case, the spectral tem-\nplate matrix was created by concatenating the spectral tem-\nplates from all instrument models:\nW= [W(1)W(2)W(3)] (4)\nthus, W‚ààRf√ó183. After the NMF update rule was applied\nto the input log-spectrum V, the pitch activation matrix wascreated by summing the component vectors from Hthat cor-\nrespond to the same pitch p:\nH/prime\np,n=Hp,n+Hp+61,n+Hp+122,n (5)\n4.3 Note tracking\nInstead of simply thresholding the pitch activation H/primeas was\ndone in [6], additional postprocessing is applied in order to\nperform note smoothing and tracking. Here, the approach\nused in [4] was employed, where each pitch pis modeled by\na two-state HMM, denoting pitch activity/inactivity.\nThe hidden state sequence for each pitch is given by Qp=\n{qp[t]}. MIDI Ô¨Åles from the RWC database [11] from the\nclassic and jazz subgenres were employed in order to esti-\nmate the state priors P(qp[1])and the state transition matrix\nP(qp[t]|qp[t‚àí1])for each pitch p. For each pitch, the most\nlikely state sequence is given by:\nÀÜQp= arg max\nqp[t]/productdisplay\ntP(qp[t]|qp[t‚àí1])P(op[t]|qp[t])(6)\nwhich can be computed using the Viterbi algorithm [16].\nFor estimating the observation probability for each active\npitchP(op[t]|qp[t] = 1) , we use a sigmoid curve which has\nas input the pitch activation hp=H/primep,nfrom the output of\nthe transcription model:\nP(op[t]|qp[t] = 1) =1\n1 +e‚àí(hp‚àíŒª)(7)\nwhereŒªis a parameter that controls the smoothing (a high\nvalue will discard pitch candidates with low energy). The\nresult of the HMM postprocessing step is a binary piano-\nroll transcription which can be used for evaluation.\nFor setting the parameter Œªfor the harpsichord transcrip-\ntion experiments, we employed a training dataset consisting\nof the 7 harpsichord recordings present in the RWC classical\nmusic database [11]. As a ground truth for the recordings,\nthe syncRWC MIDI Ô¨Åles were used2. Since for the present\nsystem a conservative transcription with high precision is fa-\nvorable,Œªwas set to 0.25, which results in a false alarm rate\nof 5.33% with a missed detection rate of 46.49% (see [4]\nfor metric deÔ¨Ånitions). An example harpsichord transcrip-\ntion is shown in Figure 2, where the piano-roll transcription\nof recording RWC MDB-C-2001 No. 24b is seen along with\nits respective MIDI ground truth.\n5. PRECISE F0 ESTIMATION\nBased on the transcription results, we search for spectral\npeaks corresponding to the partials of each identiÔ¨Åed note.\nFor identiÔ¨Åcation of the correct peaks, the tuning reference\nfrequency and inharmonicity of the tone also need to be es-\ntimated. For Baroque music, the tuning reference frequency\n(expressed as the fundamental frequency of the note A4) is\n2http://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/AIST-Annotation/SyncRWC\n283Poster Session 2\n(b)MIDIPitch(a)MIDIPitch\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 80001000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000\n304050607080304050607080Figure 2 .

Units on the ab-\nscissa correspond to 10ms.\nusually lower than the modern standard of 440 Hz. For our\ndata set, the CD sleeve notes mention reference frequencies\nof 405, 415 and 440 Hz, with the majority of CDs not giving\nany value. This introduces a problem: without knowing the\nscore (or at least the key) of a piece of music, it is not pos-\nsible to determine the reference frequency unambiguously,\nsince, for example, a note with F0 around 415 Hz could be\nA4 (reference 415 Hz) or G /sharp4 (reference 440 Hz).\nThe tuning frequency is ascertained by the following iter-\native process: 40 frames are selected (equally spaced through-\nout the piece) and the fundamental frequency estimation stage\ndescribed below is computed, using an initial value of 440\nHz for the tuning frequency and taking the inharmonicity es-\ntimates from measurements of other harpsichords [8]. The\nfrequencies are divided by their nominal values (given the\nreference frequency and assuming equal temperament), and\na weighted average of the deviations is computed. The ref-\nerence frequency is updated by the result and the process is\nrepeated for 5 iterations, or until it converges (the update is\nless than one cent) if sooner.\nThe inharmonicity of each note is estimated jointly with\nits fundamental frequency. For a string with (ideal) funda-\nmental frequency f0and inharmonicity constant B, the fre-\nquencyfkof thekth partial is given by [10]:\nfk=kf0/radicalbig\n1 +Bk2 (8)\nwhere the constants f0andBdepend on the physical prop-\nerties of the string. Given any two partials of a note, it is\npossible to solve for f0andB, assuming the partial num-\nbers are known. We compute these two parameters for each\npair of partials estimated below, and use a robust statistic,the median over all frames and partial pairs, to estimate the\ntrue values, using the inter-quartile range as an inverse mea-\nsure of conÔ¨Ådence in the estimates.\nThe fundamental frequency and inharmonicity of each\ntranscribed note are computed as follows:\n1) Compute the STFT using the following parameters: fs=\n44100 Hz, Blackman-Harris window with support size of\n4096 samples (93 ms), zero padding factor z= 4 (N=\n16384 ), and hop size of 1024 samples.\n2) For each note wgiven by the transcription, compute an\ninitial estimate of the frequency fw\nkof partialk= 1...40\nwith equation 8, using the reference frequency computed\nabove, the inharmonicity estimate from [8], and assuming\nequal temperament for the fundamental.\n3) For each partial frequency, a local spectral peak in a win-\ndow of¬±30cents around fw\nkis sought, and if found the\nfrequency estimate is reÔ¨Åned as described in subsection 2.2.\n4) Using the transcription, any overlapping partials are iden-\ntiÔ¨Åed and deleted from the estimate, as they are likely to give\nunreliable values. Partials are deemed to overlap if their fre-\nquency separation is less than 3.03fsz/N [2].\n5) For each pair of partials remaining, solve for F0 and B\nusing equation 8.\n6) For each pitch class k, convert each frequency estimate\nto cents deviation from equal temperament and return the\nweighted median ÀÜckas the overall tuning value for the pitch\nclass, where the weights are given by the pitch activation\nH/primep,n(Equation 5). This gives a 12-dimensional temper-\nament vector, which can be compared with the proÔ¨Åles of\nknown theoretical temperaments. For simplicity we repre-\nsent the pitch class kby an integer from 0 (C) to 11 (B),\ncorresponding to the MIDI pitch number modulo 12.\n6. TEMPERAMENT ESTIMATION\nOur temperament classiÔ¨Åer recognises the following tem-\nperaments: equal, Ô¨Åfth comma, Vallotti, quarter comma mean-\ntone (QCMT), Ô¨Åfth comma meantone (FCMT), sixth comma\nmeantone (SCMT), Kellner, Werckmeister III, Lehman, Nei-\ndhardt (1,2 and 3), Kirnberger (2 and 3) and just intonation.\nWe also recognise rotations of these temperaments, although\nthis is not a typical tuning practice for all temperaments, as\nillustrated by the example of the Young II temperament, a\nrotation of the Vallotti temperament, which is considered a\ndifferent temperament in its own right. Rotations are spec-\niÔ¨Åed via the wolf interval where applicable (e.g. SCMT-FD\nhas wolf interval F /sharp-D/flat, as in Figure 1), otherwise by the\nnumber of semitones rotated (e.g. Vall+7).\nGiven the estimate ÀÜc= (ÀÜc0,..., ÀÜc11)and a temperament\nproÔ¨Åleci= (ci\n0,...,ci\n11)for temperament i, we calculate\nthe divergence between estimate and proÔ¨Åle, d(ÀÜc,ci):\nd(ÀÜc,ci) =11/summationdisplay\nk=0uk(ÀÜck‚àíci\nk‚àír)2\n/summationtext11\nj=0uj(9)\nwhereuk=/summationtext\nn/summationtext\np‚â°kmod 12H/primep,nis the weight for pitch\n28412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nclassk, andr=/summationtext11\nj=0ui(ÀÜcj‚àíci\nj)//summationtext11\nj=0ujis the offset in\ncents which minimises the divergence and thus compensates\nfor deviations in the reference tuning frequency (pitch A4)\nfrom the reference computed above in previous calculations.\nA piece is classiÔ¨Åed as having the temperament iwhose pro-\nÔ¨Ålecigives the least divergence d(ÀÜc,ci). We also consider\nrotations of temperaments, ci,r, given byci,r\nk=ci\nm, where\nm‚â°(k+r) mod 12 , in order to deal with different posi-\ntions of the wolf interval in meantone temperaments, as well\nas the tuning ambiguity discussed in section 5.\n7. SUMMARY OF RESULTS\nThe results are summarised in Table 13. Column 1 is our\nCD index, where letters are used to distinguish groups of\ntracks with different temperament metadata. Column 2 shows\nthe annotated reference tuning, while the mean and stan-\ndard deviation of the estimated reference tuning are given in\ncolumns 3 and 4 respectively. Columns 5 to 8 give the an-\nnotated temperament, the average divergence d(ÀÜc,ci)from\nthis temperament, the most frequent highest ranked temper-\nament according to d(ÀÜc,ci), and the average difference in\ndivergence between the annotated temperament and the best\nranked temperament.\nThe results for tuning show agreement with the ground\ntruth values where they were available, with the exception\nof CD 21, which had only 2 tracks at 440 Hz. The CDs gen-\nerally show tuning consistency across all tracks, with high\nstandard deviations ( >2 Hz) being due to a bimodal dis-\ntribution of tuning frequency (CD 18) and 5 outlier tracks\n(CDs 2,7,19). Summarising by CD assumes Ô¨Åxed tuning for\nall tracks, which is clearly not always the case.\nThe temperament results vary from close agreement to\nthe metadata (CDs 4,5,8,9,16,21,22) to moderate agreement\n(e.g. CDs 15, 18) to disagreement (e.g. CDs 12,13, 17). An\nexample is shown in Figure 3. For a number of tracks it was\nnot possible to Ô¨Ånd a single ‚Äúbest Ô¨Åt‚Äù, as some temperaments\nare only distinguished by a pitch class which does not appear\n(or is not detected) within the piece. The large divergences\nof CDs 2 and 19 are explained by the tuning frequency being\nat the half-way point between two semitones relative to the\n440 Hz reference assumed by the transcription algorithm,\nmaking the transcriptions unreliable.\nOn CD 17 and some other tracks specifying QCMT, the\ntemperament was often closer to FCMT. This is an inter-\nesting tendency, as two are fairly similar, with FCMT be-\ning milder (slightly larger major thirds and a smaller wolf\ninterval). It seems plausible that QCMT was intended but\nthen tempered to bring it (inadvertantly) closer to the less\nextreme FCMT. However, the opposite tendency appears on\nCD 3a. Werckmeister 3 is speciÔ¨Åed on Ô¨Åve CDs, but only\nfulÔ¨Åls the claim on two. The reason may be that Werck-\nmeister 3 is popular as a starting point for tuners while they\nexperiment and develop their own temperaments, or that it\n3It is not possible to Ô¨Åt all results into this paper.

CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a method for analysing harpsichord tem-\nperament directly from audio recordings, using an NMF-\nbased transcription system, followed by bias-corrected quad-\nratically interpolated short-time spectral analysis to estimate\npartial frequencies, estimation of inharmonicity, deletion of\noverlapping partials, and robust statistics weighted by the\npitch salience given by the transcription system.

This also raises an interesting issue about\nthe nature of human annotations and their use as ‚Äúground\ntruth‚Äù. The metadata provided with the CD is intended to\ngive an indication of the tuning system rather than scientiÔ¨Å-\ncally accurate documentation, and we need to be discerning\nin the use of metadata that has been collected for a purpose\nother than scientiÔ¨Åc analysis or evaluation.\n9.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient approach for the identification of the predominant voice from polyphonic musical audio. The algorithm implements an auditory streaming model which builds upon tone objects and salient pitches.

The algorithm implements an auditory streaming model\nwhich builds upon tone objects and salient pitches. The\nformation of voices is based on the regular update of the\nfrequency and the magnitude of so called streaming agents,\nwhich aim at salient tones or pitches close to their preferred\nfrequency range. Streaming agents which succeed to assem-\nble a big magnitude start new voice objects, which in turn\nadd adequate tones. The algorithm was evaluated as part of a\nmelody extraction system during the MIREX audio melody\nextraction evaluation, where it gained very good results in\nthe voicing detection and overall accuracy.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMelody is deÔ¨Åned as a linear succession of tones which is\nperceived as a single entity. One important characteristic\nof the tone sequence is the smoothness of the melody pitch\ncontour. There are different techniques to avoid large fre-\nquency intervals in the tone sequence ‚Äì at present two main\nalgorithm types can be distinguished:\nOn the one hand, there are probabilistic frameworks that\ncombine pitch salience values and smoothness constraints\nin a cost function that is evaluated by optimal path Ô¨Ånd-\ning methods like the hidden Markov Model (HMM), the\nViterbi algorithm or dynamic programming (DP). On the\nother hand, there are rule based approaches that trace multi-\nple F0 contours over time using criteria like magnitude and\npitch proximity in order to link salient pitch candidates of\nadjacent analysis frames. Subsequently, a melody line is\nformed from these tone-like pitch trajectories, using rules\nthat take the necessary precautions to assure a smooth melodic\ncontour. Of course such a division is rather artiÔ¨Åcial.

And vice versa a statistical\napproach can be used to model tones. In fact, Ryyn ¬®anen\nand Klapuri have implemented a method for the automatic\ndetection of singing melodies in polyphonic music, where\nthey derive a HMM for note events from fundamental fre-\nquencies, their saliences and an accent signal [8].\nThere are many stable probabilistic relationships that can\nbe observed in melody tone sequences [6]. This fact makes\nthe application of a statistical model so useful, because such\ncharacteristics can easily be expressed mathematically in or-\nder to Ô¨Ånd the optimal succession of tones. Hence, most\napproaches to voice processing are statistical methods that\naccomplish the tone trajectory forming and the identiÔ¨Åca-\ntion of the melody voice simultaneously [4, 5, 7]. Rao and\nRao advocate DP over variants of partial and tone tracking,\nbut also clearly state the problems of most statistical meth-\nods [7].\nWhile for rule-based approaches alternative melody lines\ncan be recovered quite easily, there is no effective possibil-\nity to retrieve alternative paths for DP approaches, because\nthe mathematical optimization of the methods depends on\nthe elimination of concurrent paths. Hence, it is not easy to\nstate whether the most likely choice stands out from all other\npaths. This problem is most evident if two or more voices\nof comparable strength occur simultaneously within a mu-\nsical piece. Work towards a solution to this problem was\npresented in [7], giving an example for DP with dual fun-\ndamental frequency tracking. The system tracks an ordered\npair of two pitches, but it cannot ensure that the two contours\nwill remain faithful to their respective sound sources.\nAnother challenging problem is the identiÔ¨Åcation of non-\nvoiced portions, e.g. frames where no melody voice occurs.\nThe simultaneous identiÔ¨Åcation of the optimal path together\nwith the identiÔ¨Åcation of melody frames is not easy to ac-\ncomplish within one statistical model, so often the voic-\ning detection is performed by a separate processing step.\nNonetheless, optimal path Ô¨Ånding algorithms may be con-\nfused by breaks in the tone sequence, especially because\nthe usual transition probabilities do not apply in between\nmelodic phrases.\n19Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\npitch spectrogram \n&\nactive tone liststreaming agents\ncapture salient\ntones & pitches\n‚óè tone magnitude‚óè voice to \n tone distance‚óè freq. dynamics melody tonesvoice objects \nadd tones \nto voicesidentify\nmelody voice\n‚óè voice magnitude‚óè (frequency)Figure 1 . Overview of the voice estimation algorithm\nIn this paper, we present an algorithm for the identiÔ¨Å-\ncation of predominant voices in music that addresses some\nof the above-mentioned problems. Although no statistical\nmodel is implemented, probabilistic relationships that can\nbe observed in melody tone sequences are exploited.\n2. METHOD\n2.1 Overview\nFigure 2.1 shows an overview of the algorithm. The in-\nput to the proposed algorithm are the tone objects and/or\nsalient pitches of the current frame. The formation of mu-\nsical voices is a continuous process destined by the frame-\nwise evolution of so-called streaming agents, which are dis-\ntributed along the frequency spectrum. A streaming agent\ngains power by the capturing of salient tones or pitches.\nMoreover, it changes its position in the frequency spectrum\nin order to move towards salient sounds. V oice objects can\nbe derived from the streaming agents. Then, adequate tone\nobjects are assigned to the respective voices. Finally, the\nmelody voice is chosen from the set of voices. The main cri-\nterion for the selection is the magnitude of the voice. Only\ntone objects of the melody voice qualify as melody tones.\n2.2 Formation of Streaming Agents\nThe voice detection is based on 18 streaming agents (SA).\nEach streaming agent denotes a very simple voice forma-\ntion unit, which independently selects a succession of strong\ntones or pitches. It is mainly characterized by its magnitude\n¬ØAsa, and two frequency based measures: a variable position\n¬Øfsaand a Ô¨Åxed home position fsahome, which are both given\nin cent. The home positions of the streaming agents are dis-\ntributed evenly with a distance of 300 cent over the allowed\nmelody frequency range.\nOver time, each streaming agents gradually moves to-\nwards the selected sound sources and assembles a magni-\ntude corresponding to the rating magnitude of the captured\ntone objects.\n15\n 10\n 5\n 0 5 10 15\nfrequency distance [semitone]0.00.20.40.60.81.0weight\nw_1\nw_2Figure 2 . Gaussian Weighting Functions\n2.2.1 Selection of Tones\nIn each analysis frame, the streaming agents searches for\nstrong tones and pitches. In the further description, we refer\nonly to tone objects, although the method can be also used\nfor frame-wise estimated pitch magnitudes as described for\nexample in [3]. For the identiÔ¨Åcation of the best matching\ntone a rating is calculated from four criteria:\n‚Ä¢magnitude: The tone magnitude Atoneis a good indi-\ncator for the perceptual importance of a tone.\n‚Ä¢frequency distance weight: It is due to the Ô¨Åxed home\nposition that each SA may pick different notes in a\npolyphonic signal. While at the one hand a strong se-\nlection criterion is the magnitude of the tone object,\nat the other hand the agent‚Äôs choice is strongly biased\ntowards its own home position. The frequency dis-\ntance ‚àÜfin cent between the tone‚Äôs pitch ftoneand the\nstreaming agent‚Äôs home position fsahome enters into\nthe rating as a weighting factor that is calculated us-\ning a Gaussian function w1(‚àÜf):\nw1(‚àÜf) =e‚àí0.5(‚àÜf)2\n6402 (1)\nFigure 2.2.1 shows the weighting function, which reaches\nhalf the maximum value at a frequency difference of\napproximately 750 cent.\n‚Ä¢frequency deviation: Human listeners draw particular\nattention to all sounds with changing attributes. If a\ntone has a varying frequency deviation (persistently\nmore than 20 cent frequency difference in between\nanalysis frames) the rating is doubled. Accordingly,\nthe deviation factor Dis set to one or two in the Ô¨Ånal\nrating.\n‚Ä¢capture mode: There should be a tendency of the SA\nto continuously track an already captured tone object.\nIf a tone object has already been captured by a SA,\nthe rating for the tone object is boosted by the factor\nC= 1.5. Otherwise, the factor is set to one. (See\nsection 2.2.2 for a detailed explanation of the capture\nmode.)\n2012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nThe rating is estimated for all streaming agents and Ô¨Å-\nnally, each streaming agent ‚Äùpicks‚Äù only one tone ‚Äì the ob-\nject with the maximum rating magnitude Arating:\nArating=D¬∑C¬∑Atone¬∑w1(ftone‚àífsahome) (2)\nFor the rating of pitches the boost factors DandCare omit-\nted ‚Äì the rating is simply the product of pitch magnitude and\nthe frequency distance weight.\n2.2.2 Modes of Tone Capturing\nAs the streaming agent approaches salient sound sources,\ntwo different modes are distinguished within the tone cap-\nturing process: aim andcaptured . In the aim mode the\nstreaming agent aims at a distinct tone object and moves\nslowly towards the selected pitch or tone.\nIn order to capture a tone, the SA must aim at the distinct\ntone for a speciÔ¨Åc time span. The demanded time depends\non the difference between the variable position of the SA ¬Øfsa\nand the tone‚Äôs frequency ftone1. As long as the SA aims at\nthe same tone object, a capture counter nis incremented in\neach analysis frame. The tone is captured if2:\nn>1\n30/vextendsingle/vextendsingle¬Øfsa‚àíftone/vextendsingle/vextendsingle. (3)\nAs the SA moves towards the selected pitch, the frequency\ndifference between tone and streaming agent becomes smaller\nduring the capturing process. Since the adaptation speed of\nthe variable position ¬Øfsadepends on many parameters, the\nduration needed to capture a tone cannot be immediately\nassessed from the frequency difference between successive\nnotes. As soon as the SA aims at a sound object in a differ-\nent frequency region, the capture counter is set to zero.\nThe mode captured might not be reached by every tone\nin very complex or noisy music signals. Yet, it is not neces-\nsary that a tone is captured by a streaming agent to qualify\nas a melody tone. The aimmode is generally sufÔ¨Åcient to\nensure the propagation of the streaming agents towards the\nmost signiÔ¨Åcant sound sources. Still, the additional mode\nenhances the movement of the streaming agent towards the\nselected tone objects.\n2.2.3 Magnitude Update\nThe streaming agent is able to increase its magnitude ¬ØAsa\nwhenever it reaches the capture mode captured . The mag-\nnitude it assembles depends on the current rating magnitude\nof the selected tone as given in equation 2, but without tak-\ning into account the boosting factor C. The slightly altered\nrating magnitude is labeled A‚àó\nrating. The use of this rating\nmagnitude implies that a streaming agent which captures a\n1All frequencies are measured in cent.\n2The condition assumes a hop-size of 5.8 ms between two analysis\nframes.tone far away from the home positions will not build up a\nhigh magnitude.\nHowever, for the computation of the magnitude, the ini-\ntial ratingA‚àó\nrating is weighted by a second frequency distance\nweighting which exploits the distance between the variable\nposition of the streaming agent ¬Øfsaand the tone‚Äôs frequency\nftone. The weighting function remains the same: the Gaus-\nsian function w1given in equation 1. The additional weight-\ning assures that the streaming agent proÔ¨Åts more from tone\nmagnitudes which are close to its current position ¬Øfsa.\nIn order to update the magnitude values we use the expo-\nnential moving average (EMA)3:\n¬ØAsa‚ÜíŒ±x¬∑¬ØAsa+ (1‚àíŒ±x)¬∑A‚àó\nrating¬∑w1(ftone‚àí¬Øfsa).(4)\nThe start value for the iterative calculation of the EMA is\nzero. The smoothing factor Œ±xdepends on the current weighted\nratingA‚àó\nrating¬∑w1(ftone,¬Øfsa). If the current value is higher\nthan the actual EMA value, Œ±xcorresponds to a half life pe-\nriod of 1 second, otherwise the half life period is set to 500\nms. If the streaming agent is only in aimcapture mode, the\nmagnitude of the streaming agent is damped with a half life\nperiod of 500 ms.\n2.2.4 Position Update\nThe streaming agent changes its variable position ¬Øfsato-\nwards salient tones or pitches. The speed of the position\nadaptation is mainly determined by three factors:\n‚Ä¢the tone‚Äôs magnitude: the bigger the tone magnitude\nin comparison to the long term average weightings,\nthe faster the SA changes its position.\n‚Ä¢the distance between captured tone and the streaming\nagent‚Äôs home position: the SA tends to move faster\ntowards its own home position. This behavior ensures\nthe stream segregation for a cycle of quickly alternat-\ning high and low tones as described in [1, chapter 2].\n‚Ä¢the frequency deviation: the SA moves faster towards\nfrequency modulated tones.\n‚Ä¢the capture mode : the SA moves faster towards cap-\ntured tones.\nFrom this it follows that the basic weighing for the posi-\ntion update is similar to the rating magnitude Arating for the\ntone selection process as given in equation 2. In order to\n3The EMA applies weighting factors to all previous data points which\ndecrease exponentially, giving more importance to recent observations\nwhile still not discarding older observations entirely. The smoothing factor\nŒ±determines the impact of past events on the actual EMA. It is a number\nbetween 0 and 1. A lower smoothing factor discards older results faster. A\nmore intuitive measure than the smoothing factor is the so called half-life\nperiod. It denotes the time span over which the initial impact of an observa-\ntion decreases by a factor of two. Taking into account the desired half-life\nthand the time period between two EMA calculations ‚àÜt‚âà5.8ms, the\ncorresponding smoothing factor is calculated as follows: Œ±= 0.5‚àÜt/th.\n21Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nestimate the signiÔ¨Åcance of the current rating magnitude, it\nhas to be set into relation with the ratings of previous anal-\nysis frames. That‚Äôs why we introduce a position magnitude,\nwhich is the exponential moving average of previous rat-\nings:\n¬ØApos‚ÜíŒ±1.5s¬∑¬ØApos+ (1‚àíŒ±1.5s)¬∑Arating. (5)\nIn order to adapt the variable position ¬Øfsaof the streaming\nagent, the current rating is set into relation with the EMA of\nprevious ratings:\n¬Øfsa‚Üí¬ØApos¬Øfsa+ (1‚àíŒ±500ms)¬∑Arating¬∑ftone\n¬ØApos+ (1‚àíŒ±500ms)¬∑Arating. (6)\nThe initial value for the iterative calculation is the home\npositionfsahome. Parameter Œ±500ms is a smoothing factor,\nwhich corresponds to a half life time of 500 ms4.\n2.3 Formation of Voices\nThe positions and magnitudes of the 18 streaming agents are\nthe foundation for the voice estimation. Figure 3 shows how\nthe progress of the multiple streaming agents is inÔ¨Çuenced\nby salient tone objects. It can be noted that the approximate\nprogression of musical voices is already suggested by the\ndistribution of the streaming agents.\nEach streaming agent which poses a local magnitude max-\nimum is a candidate for the formation of a voice object. This\nmeans that each voice object is in general linked to a stream-\ning agent with the peak magnitude compared to the magni-\ntude of the neighboring agents. Of course, the local maxi-\nmum may shift from one streaming agent to another. In this\ncase, the voice may gradually change the assigned link to a\nneighboring streaming agent within the duration of approx-\nimately 20 analysis frames. The position of a voice fvoice\nis deÔ¨Åned by the position ¬Øfsaof the linked streaming agent.\nThe magnitude of the voice Avoiceis deÔ¨Åned by the streamer\nmagnitude ¬ØAsa. If the voice is currently adapting to a new\nstreaming agent, weighted average values of the concerning\ntwo streaming agents are used.\nIf a streaming agent with a local maximum magnitude\nis not assigned to a voice object, it may start a new one.\nHowever, a new voice is created only if the streaming agent\nis more than 4 streaming agents away from a any stream-\ning agent linked to another voice, or if the frequency dif-\nference between the streaming agent and all other existing\nvoices is greater than 600 cent. A voice object is eliminated\nif the voice magnitude is smaller than 5 percent of the global\nmaximum voice magnitude or if two voices aim at the same\nstreaming agent. In the latter case the voice with the smaller\nmagnitude is eliminated.\n4Since the position weight depends on many factors, parameter Œ±does\nnot exactly set any half life period for the position update. Yet the corre-\nsponding time span gives a reference point for the approximate adaptation\nspeed.2.4 Adding Tones to Voices\nNow that voice objects have been deÔ¨Åned, adequate tone ob-\njects must be added. The only voice tone candidate is actu-\nally the currently selected tone of the corresponding stream-\ning agent. If the voice is adapting to a new streaming agent,\nthe closest streaming agent is used as a reference. Several\nmeasures are taken to ensure a reliable voicing detection.\nThis means even if the corresponding streaming agent has\nselected a tone, the tone candidate has to be validated in or-\nder to qualify as a voice tone.\n2.4.1 Distance Threshold\nAlthough the proposed algorithm does not apply a common\nstatistical model, it takes advantage of the most eminent\nprobabilistic relationships in melodic tone sequences [6]: 1)\nMelodies consist typically of tones that are close to one an-\nother in pitch. 2) There is a strong tendency for a regression\nto the mean pitch.\nThe frequency of the voice represents the weighted av-\nerage frequency of the recently selected tone objects, so in\na way the voice position can be seen as the adaptive com-\nputation of the mean pitch. Consequently, the best voice\ntone candidates are close to the actual voice position. Ade-\nquate voice tones have to be within an octave range of the\nactual voice position. Another obvious thing to do would be\nthe adjustment of the magnitude thresholds according to the\nfrequency distance. This idea is implemented in the short\nterm magnitude threshold described in section 2.4.3.\n2.4.2 Global Long Term Magnitude Threshold\nThe global long term magnitude threshold is implemented\nas an adaptive threshold that is valid for all voices. It decays\nwith a half life period of 5 seconds. If a tone magnitude\nappears which is larger than the current long term magni-\ntude value, the magnitude threshold is updated to the new\nmaximum.\nThe magnitude of the candidate voice tone is compared\nto the long term maximum value. In order to pass the global\nthreshold, tones should not be more than 8 dB below the\ndecaying maximum value. Still, other criteria may alter the\neffective threshold value ‚Äì in the best case the allowed dy-\nnamic range is increased from 8 dB to 20 dB:\n‚Ä¢The capture level of the assigned streaming agent and\nits two neighbors are evaluated. Depending on how\nmany streaming agents are in capture mode captured\nconcerning the candidate voice tone, the effective thresh-\nold may decreased to 14 dB below the decaying max-\nimum. On the other hand, the threshold is increased\nfor all tones that are not selected (aimed) by at least 5\nstreaming agents in the long term average.\n‚Ä¢A variation of the fundamental frequency (vibrato or\nglides) increases the noticeability of tones. In this\n2212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0\ntime (s)0100020003000frequency (cent)Figure 3 . Streaming Agents: It can be seen how the streaming agents (thin lines) move towards salient tones and pitches. To\nmaintain clarity salient pitches are not shown. The identiÔ¨Åed tone objects are indicated by dark bold lines. When the bass voice\ncomes in, some streaming agents turn to the bass voice as it is closer to their preferred home position.\ncase the threshold is lowered by 6 dB.\n2.4.3 Short Term Magnitude Threshold\nThe short term magnitude threshold is estimated separately\nfor each voice. It secures that shortly after a strong tone is\nÔ¨Ånished no weaker tone is included as a voice tone, so it is\nespecially useful to bridge small time gaps between strong\ntones of a voice. Furthermore, the threshold delays the in-\nclusion of tones that are far away from the current voice po-\nsition. To achieve this the tone magnitude is again weighted\nwith a frequency distance weight, evaluating the frequency\noffset between tone and voice:\nw2=r+ (1‚àír)¬∑w1(ftone‚àífvoice). (7)\nFigure 2.2.1 shows that the weighting function w2is asym-\nmetric. Tones in the lower frequency range of an instrument\nor the voice are often softer. Hence, parameter ris set to\n0.4 for tones with a lower frequency than the current voice\nposition, otherwise r= 0.2.\nThe short term threshold is adaptive and decays with a\nhalf life time of 100 ms. If a weighted tone magnitude\nw2¬∑Atoneappears which is larger than the current short term\nmagnitude threshold, the threshold is updated to the new\nmaximum. The tone passes the threshold if it is no more\nthan 6 dB below the current threshold value.\n2.5 The IdentiÔ¨Åcation of the Melody Voice\nThe most promising feature to distinguish melody tones from\nall other sounds is the magnitude. The magnitude of the\ntones is of course reÔ¨Çected by the voice magnitude. Hence,\nin general the voice with the highest magnitude is selected\nas the melody voice. It may happen that two ore more voices\nhave about the same magnitude and thus no clear decision\ncan be taken. In this case, the voices are weighted accord-\ning to their frequency: voices in very low frequency regions\nreceive a lower weight.3. EV ALUATION\n3.1 Qualitative Evaluation\nA striking advantage of the proposed method is its compu-\ntational efÔ¨Åciency and the continuously updated voice in-\nformation in real time. Moreover, the algorithm is Ô¨Çexi-\nble enough to track a variable number of concurrent voices.\nThis is the main reason for the good melody detection ac-\ncuracy for instrumental music excerpts with two or more\nstrong voices like the one shown in Ô¨Ågure 4.\nThe segregation of notes into different auditory streams\ndepends on many aspects ‚Äì like for example the magnitude,\nfrequency and timbre of tones. Psychoacoustic experiments\nhave shown that the grouping of tones also depends on the\nrate [1]. Due to the delayed capturing of tone objects, the\npresented method is able to take into account temporal as-\npects of the evolving signal. For example a series of alternat-\ning high and low tones will be integrated into one auditory\nstream at a low playback speed. Yet, with increasing rate\nhigh and low tones are grouped into individual voices.\nNonetheless, it must be noted that many aspects of hu-\nman perception cannot be covered. Although the algorithm\nallows a broad dynamic range for melody tones, in some in-\nterpretations an even greater dynamic range can be found,\nespecially if the melody is sung by a human. Still, by low-\nering the magnitude thresholds many tones from the accom-\npaniment will be selected by mistake. A simple magnitude\nthreshold cannot avoid all errors.\n3.2 MIREX Audio Melody Extraction Task\nThe presented method for the detection of predominant voices\nhas been implemented as part of a melody extraction algo-\nrithm which was evaluated at the Music Information Re-\ntrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) [2]. Algorithm pa-\nrameters regarding the width and the shape of the weight-\ning functions as well as the timing constants of the adaptive\nthresholds have been adjusted using the melody extraction\ntraining data of ISMIR 2004 and MIREX 2005. Although\nthe presented parameter sets maximize accuracy in the two\n23Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0\ntime (s)0100020003000frequency (cent)Figure 4 .

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we presented an efÔ¨Åcient approach to auditory\nstream segregation in polyphonic music. The MIREX re-\nsults show that the proposed method allows a reliable iden-\ntiÔ¨Åcation of the predominant voice in different kinds of poly-\nphonic music. The qualitative evaluation shows that the al-\ngorithm mimics some characteristics of stream segregation\nin the human auditory system, taking into account the mag-\nnitude of tones, note intervals and playback speed. How-ever, timbral features are not exploited to group tones. In\norder to reach a higher accuracy an instrument/singing voice\nrecognition is required.\n5. REFERENCES\n[1] A. S. Bregman.

        "abstract": "Existing audio-score alignment methods assume that the audio performance is faithful to a fully-notated MIDI score. For semi-improvised music (e.g. jazz), this assumption is strongly violated. In this paper, we address the problem of aligning semi-improvised music audio with a lead sheet. Our approach does not require prior training on performances of the lead sheet to be aligned. We start by analyzing the problem and propose to represent the lead sheet as a MIDI file together with a structural information file.

INTRODUCTION\nIn this work we investigate the problem of aligning an audio\nrecording of semi-improvised music to a lead sheet. This\nproblem belongs to a more general research problem called\nscore alignment , i.e. Ô¨Ånding the time mapping between a\nmusical performance and its score. The fulÔ¨Ållment of this\ntask would be very useful for a number of applications like\nsynchronizing multiple sources (video, audio, score, etc.) of\nmusic in a digital library and automatically accompanying a\nmusical performance.\nIn the last two decades, many methods have been pro-\nposed for score alignment in different problem settings: MIDI\nto MIDI, audio to MIDI, monophonic or polyphonic audio\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc‚Éù2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.performances, online or ofÔ¨Çine, etc. [4]. However, most\nmethods assume faithful performances to a fully-notated score,\nwith at most a tempo change and key transposition.\nWe call modern jazz semi-improvised , because many sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant elements of the music are improvised but deeper-\nlevel structural aspects remain relatively Ô¨Åxed. The score for\nsemi-improvised music is called a lead sheet . A lead sheet\nspeciÔ¨Åes only essential elements like a basic melody, har-\nmony, lyric and a basic musical form. A performer typically\nimprovises all the notes in a solo, changes in tempo, ac-\ncompaniment Ô¨Åguration and even some structural elements\nof a piece (e.g. repeating a chorus). The nature of semi-\nimprovised music makes the alignment to a lead sheet very\nchallenging. Even for an educated musician it is sometimes\ndifÔ¨Åcult to align an improvisation to the lead sheet when the\nimprovisation has high degree of freedom.\nFor aligning such performances, a few methods have been\nproposed. Dannenberg and Mont-Reynaud [5] aligned a\njazz solo performance with the chord progression on the\nscore. Pardo and Birmingham [10] aligned a polyphonic\nsemi-improvised MIDI performance with its lead sheet. They\nalso proposed a method [11] to follow a performance with\npossible structural variations, i.e., deviating from the ex-\npected path written on the score by skipping or repeating\na section. The above-mentioned methods have loosened the\nfaithful performance assumption, however, they are either\nlimited to deal with MIDI performances [10,11], or can only\nfollow a solo performance under a 12-bars blues form [5].\nArzt and Widmer [1] also proposed an alignment system\nto handle structural variations, but only for non-improvised\n(classical) music. To our knowledge, there is no existing\nmethods that align a semi-improvised (polyphonic) audio\nperformance under an arbitrary form with its lead sheet.\nThis problem is in some ways similar to Cover Song\nIdentiÔ¨Åcation (CSI), i.e. identifying different performances\n(usually by different artists) of the same song [7]. How-\never, variations of these performances are generally much\nless than those in what we called semi-improvised music\nsuch as modern jazz. In addition, the alignment methods\nused in CSI only serve as an intermediate step for similarity\ncalculation, and no precise time mappings are required.\nIn this paper, we attempt to address the semi-improvised\n513Poster Session 4\nmusic audio-score alignment problem, without prior train-\ning on example performances of the lead sheet to be aligned.\nWe Ô¨Årst analyze the problem‚Äôs unique properties in Section\n2, then propose an alignment system regarding these prop-\nerties in Section 3. In Section 4 we describe experiments to\ntest the system on real performances of solo piano and jazz\ncombo. Section 5 concludes this paper.\n2. PROBLEM ANALYSIS\n2.1 Basic Properties\nThe problem considered in this paper is aligning an audio\nrecording of a semi-improvised music performance to its\nlead sheet. A lead sheet usually only speciÔ¨Åes a basic melody,\nharmony, lyric and a basic musical form (structure). Take\nFigure 1(a) as an example. The melody is indicated by note\nheads. Harmony is indicated by chord symbols above the\nstaff. Lyrics are indicated as text below the staff. The text\n‚ÄúA‚Äù with a square indicates the start of Section A, and the\nrepeat sign besides it suggests that this section is often re-\npeated in a performance. We can translate this lead sheet\ninto a MIDI Ô¨Åle by setting a tempo (e.g. 120BPM), render-\ning harmony as block chords with root notes in the C2-C3\noctave and discarding the lyric and music structure informa-\ntion. The piano-roll representation of this MIDI is shown in\nFigure 1(b). We mark measures with vertical dash lines.\n(a) Lead sheet\n0 2 4 6 8C2C3C4C5\nTime (seconds)Pitch\n(b) Lead sheet converted to MIDI\n0 2.532 4.579 7.134 9.414C2C3C4C5\nTime (seconds)Pitch\n(c) First improvised performance\n0 1.828 3.627 5.479 7.376C2C3C4C5\nTime (seconds)Pitch\n(d) Second improvised performance\nFigure 1 . Four measures of the lead sheet for Dindi by An-\ntionio Carlos Jobim, and its two semi-improvised piano per-\nformances.In semi-improvised performances, the performer views\nthe lead sheet as a reference and continuously creates new\nmusical elements that are not on the score. Figures 1(c) and\n1(d) show the piano-rolls of two semi-improvised piano per-\nformances by two different pianists of the lead sheet, with\nmeasure times marked by vertical dash lines. We can see\nthat the two performances have different tempi from the lead\nsheet. Also, harmony is rendered in free rhythmic patterns.\nWe also notice that the melody contour of the lead sheet re-\nmains in the Ô¨Årst performance, while is signiÔ¨Åcantly altered\nin the second performance.\n2.2 Representing Harmonic Content\nHarmonic content is the most similar feature that an semi-\nimprovised performance and its lead sheet shares. We need\nto Ô¨Ånd a representation of harmonic content, robust to vari-\nations among different performances, on which to do the\nalignment. The chromagram is a good representation which\nhas been used in many audio-score alignment methods [4].\nIn these methods, chroma features are usually calculated for\nevery short time frame (e.g. 46 ms), so that the alignment\ncan be precise at the millisecond level. However, this choice\nis not suitable in our problem, as we can see in Figure 1 that\nperformed notes can be signiÔ¨Åcantly different from the notes\nwritten on the lead sheet at any one 46 ms frame. In fact,\nchord labels on the lead sheet are more like sets of high-\nlikelihood notes to be played over given time periods (e.g.\ntwo beats of D minor 7), and aggregating performed notes\nacross larger time spans (e.g. two beats) makes for a clearer\ncorrespondence to the score. Therefore we choose to calcu-\nlate chroma features in this scale.\n2.3 Utilizing Structural Information\nStructural information on the lead sheet is also important\nfor an alignment system. Performers often modify the ba-\nsic musical form, but not arbitrarily. For example, the basic\nform of Dindi is ‚ÄúIntro-[A-A-B-C]‚Äù, where the bracket rep-\nresents a repeat sign. Performers may skip the Intro section\nat the beginning but play it at the end. They may change the\nrepeat bracket by including the Intro section or excluding\nthe A sections. Basically, they view musical sections as toy\nbricks, selecting and shufÔ¨Çing them during a performance.\nHowever, it is not common to make other structural changes\nsuch as making a jump at the middle of a section.\nHowever, structural information on the lead sheet is not\nencoded in the MIDI representation shown in Figure 1(b).\nTherefore, we encode it in an additional Ô¨Åle, as shown in\nTable 1. Basically, this Ô¨Åle stores two kinds of information:\n1) musical section deÔ¨Ånitions and boundaries; 2) possible\njumps that an semi-improvised performance might make.\n51412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nSections from to Jumps from to\nIntro 1 16 48 1\nA 17 24 48 17\nA 25 32 48 33\nB 33 40\nC (A) 41 48\nTable 1 . Structural information extracted from the lead\nsheet for Dindi . Section C is very similar to Section A.\n3. PROPOSED SYSTEM\nBased on the above analysis, we design our system as shown\nin Figure 2. We represent both the audio and MIDI with a\nchromagram where chroma vectors are extracted at the 2-\nbeats scale, then use a modiÔ¨Åed string alignment algorithm\nthat can handle structural changes to align the chromagrams.\nFigure 2 . Overview of the proposed system.\n3.1 Audio Beat Tracking\nIn order to extract chroma features from audio at the 2-beat\nscale, we need audio beat times of the performance. We\nuse the original implementation of the beat tracking algo-\nrithm proposed by Ellis [6]. While this is a high-quality beat\ntracker, the estimated tempo often has halÔ¨Ång/doubling er-\nrors, as described in [6]. In addition, when the performancehas an unstable tempo, the algorithm may Ô¨Ånd extra beats or\nmiss some beats.\n3.2 Audio Chroma Feature Extraction\nWe Ô¨Årst chop the audio signal into 46 ms long time frames\nwith a 23 ms hop size and calculate a chroma vector for\neach frame. The frame-level chroma vector is 12-d, and is\ncalculated by ‚Äúfolding‚Äù the local maxima of the hamming-\nwindowed Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrum\nto the 12-pitch classes. This tends to suppress the non-\nharmonic part of the spectrum.\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, the ideal analysis unit is not\nthe 46 ms frame, but something on the order of 2 musi-\ncal beats. We therefore average the chroma vectors of the\nframes into segments of length land a hop size h, where\nthese values are measured in beats. The resulting chroma-\ngram is a sequence of the segment-level chroma vectors. In\nour experiments, we set landhto 2 beats and1\n4beats, re-\nspectively. A segment size of two beats worked well for the\nharmonic rhythm of the music analyzed, with the shortest\nduration chords typically being 2 beats. For the hop size h,\ntheoretically a smaller hleads to a more precise alignment.\nHowever, the computational complexity increases quickly\nashshrinks ( O(1/h2)). We investigate the inÔ¨Çuence of dif-\nferent parameters on the alignment result in Section 4.\n3.3 MIDI Chroma Feature Extraction\nAs with the audio chromagram, we segment the MIDI repre-\nsentation of the lead sheet into segments of length land hop\nsizeh, and calculate a chroma vector for each segment. We\nsimply sum up the lengths of notes in each segment to their\ncorresponding pitch-class bins. We generate 12 transposed\nMIDI chromagrams to cope with the possible key transposi-\ntion of the audio performance.\n3.4 Chromagram Scaling Problem\nIn Section 3.1, we note that the estimated tempo of the au-\ndio might be half or twice the true tempo. Therefore the au-\ndio and MIDI chromagrams might be on temporal different\nscales, which will strongly inÔ¨Çuence the alignment result.\nTo address this problem, we also segment the MIDI Ô¨Åle\nand calculate the chromagram in three ways, with segment\nlength and hop size of (l, h),(2l,2h)and(1\n2l,1\n2h), respec-\ntively. Therefore, for each audio-MIDI pair, we have 1 audio\nchromagram and 36 MIDI chromagrams, corresponding to\n3 scales and 12 key transpositions. It is noted that the idea\nof time scaling and key transposition has been used in other\nmusic information retrieval systems such as [3].\n3.5 Aligning Chromagrams\nLetA= (a1,a2,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,am)be the audio chromagram, S=\n(s1,s2,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,sn)be the score chromagram, where aiis the\n515Poster Session 4\nchroma vector of the i-th audio segment and sjis the chroma\nvector of the j-th score segment. We describe a dynamic-\nprogramming algorithm to align them. Unlike standard string\nalignment algorithms, this algorithm utilizes structural in-\nformation provided by the lead sheet (as shown in Table 1)\nto handle possible structural changes in the semi-improvised\nperformance. To do so, we deÔ¨Åne a parent-index set P(j)\nfor each score segment index j. Each element kofP(j)is a\nscore segment index, from which a semi-improvised perfor-\nmance might transition to j. This transition can be a smooth\nprogression i.e. k=j‚àí1, or a forward/backward jump. In\nthe latter case, the pair (k, j)is a possible jump listed in the\nstructural information Ô¨Åle as Table 1.\nNow we recursively deÔ¨Åne a (m+ 1)√ó(n+ 1) align-\nment cost matrix C, where the value C(i, j)is the lowest\ncost of the alignment between the initial sub-chromagrams\n(a1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,ai)and(s1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,sj). For all i= 1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, mand\nj= 1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, n,C(i, j)are calculated as follows:\nC(0,0) = 0 ,C(i,0) = i¬∑c1,C(0, j) = 0 (1)\nC(i, j) = minÔ£±\nÔ£¥Ô£≤\nÔ£¥Ô£≥C(i, j‚àí1) + c1\nC(i‚àí1, j) +c2\nmink‚ààP(j)C(i‚àí1, k) +d(ai,sj)\n(2)\nwhere c1andc2are constants specifying the costs of skip-\nping one segment of audio and score in the alignment, re-\nspectively. d(ai,sj)speciÔ¨Åes the cost of mismatching the\ni-th audio segment with the j-th score segment.\nNote that Eq. (1) is not symmetric, i.e. C(i,0)is set to\ni¬∑c1, butC(0, j)is set to 0 instead of j¬∑c2. This means\nthat we penalize skipping audio segments at the beginning\nbut do not penalize skipping score segments, i.e. we as-\nsume that the performance can start anywhere but must be\non the lead sheet. Although sometimes performers play sev-\neral measures that are unrelated to the lead sheet at the be-\nginning, this is short compared to the whole performance\nand we ignore this case. In addition, the third line in Eq.(2)\nis calculated from C(i‚àí1, k)for all possible parents kof\nthej-th score segment, while in an standard string alignment\nalgorithm it is only calculated from C(i‚àí1, j‚àí1). This al-\nlows the performance to play to the j-th score segment in all\npossible ways, either progress smoothly from the previous\nsegment j‚àí1or jumping from other segments.\nThe mismatch cost function d(ai,sj)is deÔ¨Åned as:\nd(ai,sj) = arccos(aT\nisj\n‚à•ai‚à•‚à•sj‚à•)\n(3)\nWe use cosine angle distance instead of Euclidean distance\nto make it loudness insensitive. This is because the loudness\nof the audio may vary from the loudness calculated from the\nscore differently in different performances. Since angle dis-\ntance between an arbitrary audio-score chroma vector pair is\naround 1, we set c1=c2= 1to match the three penalties.While calculating C, we Ô¨Åll another m√ónmatrix P,\nwhereP(i, j)stores the index pair (i‚Ä≤, j‚Ä≤)from which C(i, j)\nis calculated in Eq. (2). When the calculation of Cis Ô¨Ån-\nished, the Ô¨Ånal alignment cost is calculated as minjC(m, j).\nLetj1= arg min jC(m, j). We than trace back from the in-\ndex pair (m, j 1)through Pto some index pair (1, j2). The\nsequence of index pairs (1, j2),¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,(m, j 1)give the align-\nment between AandB. Note that the last pair is (m, j 1)\ninstead of (m, n). This allows the audio performance to end\nat any position of the score.\nIf we view each score segment as a state, each audio seg-\nment as an observation, then the proposed algorithm is es-\nsentially equivalent to the forward-backward algorithm for a\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) [12]. The transition matrix\nThas a positive value t1on the diagonal, corresponding to\nthe penalty of skipping an audio segment c1. It also has a\npositive value t2on the superdiagonal (elements (j‚àí1, j))\nand elements (k, j)for all k‚àà P(j), corresponding to the\npenalty of skipping a score segment c2by smooth progres-\nsions and jumps, respectively. If c1=c2, then t1=t2. We\nalso notice that this algorithm is equivalent to the one pro-\nposed by Fremerey et al. [8], which also handles jumps and\nrepeats in synchronizing a score with a performance.\nFinally, for each audio-MIDI pair, we do the alignment\n36 times corresponding to the 36 MIDI chromagrams. The\nalignment that achieves the lowest Ô¨Ånal alignment cost is\nselected as the output of the system.\n4. EXPERIMENT\n4.1 Dataset\nOur dataset consists of 36 semi-improvised performances of\n3 jazz lead sheets: Dindi by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Nicas‚Äôs\nDream by Horace Silver and Without A Song by Vincent\nYoumans, selected from commonly used jazz fake books.\nFor each song, the performances consist of two subsets. The\nÔ¨Årst subset contains MIDI recordings performed by profes-\nsional Chicago jazz pianists obtained from [9]. In [9], four\npianists each gave three different performances scaled to\nthree subjective levels of difÔ¨Åculty, ranging from a perfor-\nmance closely adhering to the given lead sheet to a more\n‚Äúfree‚Äù interpretation. After recording, these pianists also\nannotated their own performances with beat, measure and\nstructural branch point information, encoded as MIDI data.\nWe include the two less difÔ¨Åcult levels into our dataset (de-\nnoted as easy and medium ), totalling 8 jazz piano perfor-\nmances for each song. We render these MIDI performances\ninto audio recordings with the Logic Audio software using\nGrand Piano sound samples. We use the pianists‚Äô annota-\ntions to generate the ground-truth audio-score alignment.\nThe second subset contains 4 commercially released record-\nings for each lead sheet. Table 2 shows basic information for\nthem. To generate the ground-truth audio-score alignment,\n51612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ntwo musicians listened to these recordings, marked beat and\nmeasure time points and identiÔ¨Åed the score position (score\nmeasure number) of each measure of the audio. Audio mea-\nsures that are unrelated to the lead sheet (e.g. an improvised\ncadenza) were labeled score measure number 0.\nID Performer(s) InstrumentsDindi1 Astrud Gilberto female, violin, guitar\n2 Charlie Byrd guitar, saxophone\n3 Ohta San guitar\n4 Sadao Watanabe string, saxophoneNica‚Äôs...1 Art Farmer trumpet, trombone, brass\n2 Benjamin Koppel Quintet saxophone, piano, conga\n3 Cal Tjader vibraphone, piano\n4 The Hot Club violin, guitarWithout...1 Diane Schuur female, piano, bass\n2 Joe Henderson saxophone, brass, piano\n3 Oscar Peterson piano, brass\n4 Sonny Rollins saxophone, brass, guitar\nTable 2 . Improvised performances played by jazz bands.\nFor each improvised performance, we use two experi-\nmental settings. In the Ô¨Årst setting, we align the whole per-\nformance with the lead sheet. This is to observe our sys-\ntem‚Äôs behavior on a larger time scale (usually several min-\nutes). In the second setting, we randomly select 10 excerpts\nof the performance and align them with the lead sheet. The\nlength of each excerpt ranges from 16 measures to 48 mea-\nsure. This is to observe our system‚Äôs behavior on a smaller\nscale (usually 30 seconds to 2 minutes) and would be repre-\nsentative of the task of selecting a portion of audio in a mu-\nsic player and asking to be shown the corresponding place\non the lead sheet. The second setting is in general more\nchallenging, as there is less context information.\n4.2 Evaluation Measures\nA commonly used measure for audio-score alignment is Align\nRate (AR) as proposed in [2]. It is deÔ¨Åned as the percent-\nage of correctly aligned notes in the score, where ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù\nmeans that the note onset is aligned to an audio time which\ndeviates less than a short time (e.g. 250 ms) from the ground-\ntruth audio time. In our problem, however, there is no bijec-\ntive correspondence between score notes and audio notes,\nhence it is very hard to deÔ¨Åne the ground-truth audio time\nfor each score note and AR is not suitable.\nWe formulate our problem as a classiÔ¨Åcation problem,\nby assigning to each audio frame a score measure number.\nGiven this, we simply use Accuracy as our measure. It is\ncalculated as the proportion of audio frames which are cor-\nrectly assigned score measure numbers as the ground-truth.\nWe exclude those audio frames where the performance is\nunrelated to the score. This measure ranges from 0 to 1.4.3 Results\nFigure 3 shows overall results of aligning whole performances.\nAmong the 36 performances, 11 have accuracies higher than\n75%, 13 between 50% and 75%, while 6 lower than 10%.\nTheir average is 54.8%. It is noted that a random guess\nalignment would get an accuracy as the reciprocal of the\nnumber of measures on the lead sheet, about 2%.\nDNWDNWDNW00.20.40.60.81\nEasy piano    Medium piano   Jazz comboAccuracy\nFigure 3 .

In the upper panel, the system‚Äôs output\nalignment matches with the ground-truth perfectly except\nin two parts (51-58 seconds, 193 seconds - end). In both\nparts the performance is unrelated to the lead sheet. It is\nnoted that the accuracy measures always underestimate the\nperformance of the system, because the audio beat bound-\naries estimated by the beat tracking module are not perfectly\naligned with the ground-truth beat boundaries, hence the as-\nsigned score measure numbers of the audio frames that are\nclose to these boundaries are often off for ¬±1measures.\nIn the middle panel, the performance sometimes repeats\nfrom the Intro section and sometimes from Section A. Our\nsystem handles this uncertain structural change well. How-\never, it incorrectly identiÔ¨Åes the two B sections around 150\nseconds (also the two B sections around 250 seconds) as\nonly one B section with about half the tempo. Interestingly,\nit comes back to the right position after this error. In addi-\ntion, after incorrectly identifying Section A (175-192 sec-\nonds) as C and B, the system identiÔ¨Åes another A section\n(192-210 seconds) as Section C. Since Section A and C are\nalmost the same on the lead sheet, this error is reasonable.\nExcluding this error causes accuracy to increase to 65.8%.\nIn the bottom panel, our system fails totally. Audio frames\nare constantly skipped after about 16 seconds. This exam-\nple played by Diane Schuur, however, is very difÔ¨Åcult. First,\nthere are four parts (0-12, 91-97, 162-165 seconds and 179\nseconds - end) that the performance is unrelated to the lead\nsheet. Second, the performance plays at half the tempo\n517Poster Session 4\nin Section C (142-162 seconds). Third, the performance\nswitches to a new key at 165 seconds till the end.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we attempted to align semi-improvised mu-\nsic audio with its lead sheet.

INTRODUCTION  \nThe structural, or formal , analysis  of music is one of the  \nmost fundamental of analyses performed by musicologists. \nVery simply, the main goal of structural analysis is to se g-\nment music into sections that share similar characteristics, \nand apply labels to these sections . These segmentations \ntake forms such as AAB B, or ABAC, etc. With further \nanalysis, certain descriptors can also be applied to these \nsection s, such as verse, chorus, and so on [3]. \nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in  de-\nvelop ing methods for performing structural  analyses aut o-\nmatically. For a good overview on the state of automatic \nmusic audio structural segmentation we refer the reader to [10]. The growing interest in structural segmentation alg o-\nrithms is evidenced by the establishment of the structural \nsegmentation task of  the Music Information Retrieval Eva l-\nuation eXchange (MIREX) campaign [ 2]. Evaluations of \nstructural segmentation algorithms were performed  in 200 9 \nand 2010 . These evaluations were performed over colle c-\ntions  with a strong bias towards western, popular music.  \nTo perform a novel and potentially more thorough eva l-\nuation of the performance of structural segmentation alg o-\nrithms, the set of algorithms submitted to MIREX 2010 i n \nJuly 2010 was re-evaluated in May 2011 using a newly \nconstructed dataset . For the purposes o f this paper, we are \ncalling this new test collection the MIREX 2010 Version 2 \n(MRX10V2) dataset . MRX10V2  is much larger in size than  \nthe da tasets used in earlier MIREX  evaluations. It also con-\ntains a much broader range of music styles. Moreover, the \nMRX10V2 database contains multiple annota tions per \npiece. Having multiple annotations per song allows us, for \nthe first time, to  explore how well  algorithms perform this \ntask relative to human experts .  \nThe main motivation for this work stems from an ong o-\ning project called the Structural Analysis of Large Amounts \nof Music Information (SALAMI)  [3]. The SALAMI project \nis an endeavor to use music stru cture algorithms to annotate \nand segment a large corpus of music (on the order of \n300,000 songs). Its main goal is to test the feasibility and \nusefulness of current music information retrieval algorithms \non a larger scale than has commonly been performed. As a \npilot to the SALAMI project, the work presented in this p a-\nper aims to further our understanding of how current state -\nof-the-art algorithms perform at music segmentation.  \nThe rest of this paper is formatted as follows. Section 2 \ngives a description of the dataset used in this mid -cycle \nMIREX evaluation. Section 3 briefly describes the alg o-\nrithms. Section 4 presents the evaluation results.  Section 5 \noffers  some conclusions  and suggests future work .   \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that co p-\nies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011  International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n561Poster Session 4\n  \n \n 2. DATASET S: OLD AND NEW  \nThe evaluation of structure segme ntation algorithms on a \nlarge dataset requires the creation of a suitable ground \ntruth . As in virtually all cases of MIREX -style evaluations, \nground truth creation is carried out by human annotators. \nThe use of human annotators brings up two significant \nchallenges. First, there is a large labor cost involved in m a-\nnually annotating music pieces. Second, and perhaps more \nimportantly, is the notion that it is difficult to truly assert \nthat any subjective interpretation of something as complex \nas musical form i s ‚Äútruth. ‚Äù Many considerations must be \ntaken into account regarding such annotations. Both [ 1] \nand [11] lay out methodologies  for annotating musical \nstruc ture. In this work , the dataset , and subsequent annot a-\ntion methodologies  described in [ 14] are used.  \nThe MIREX 2009 and the MIREX 2010  iterations of the \nMIREX structural segmentation task had an over bias t o-\nward popular music. The dataset known as MIREX 2009 \ncontains 297 popular song annotations donated by Tampere \nUniversity of Technology, Vienna Universi ty of Technol o-\ngy and Queen Mary, University of London. Music of The \nBeatles  makes up a significant proportion of the MIREX \n2009 dataset. The MIREX 2010 dataset consists of an  anno-\ntated version of the RWC  [4] database's popular music col-\nlection . Note that the published results to the MIREX 2010 \ndataset are evaluated against a ground truth  donated by  \nmembers of the QUAERO Project.1 However, these annot a-\ntions consist of only segment boundary annotations with no \nlabeling. Hereafter,  results pertainin g to the MIREX 2010 \ndataset are evaluated against the original , labeled  structural \nannotations as distributed with the RWC collection.  \nIn order to compensate for  the popular music bias exh i-\nbited by the older datasets, the new MRX10V2 dataset was \ndeliberate ly create d to include a much wide r variety of \nmusical styles . In addition to popular music, the new dat a-\nset contains classical, jazz, live, and world music. Table 1 \npresents the distribution of styles across the MRX10V2 d a-\ntaset.  While ‚Äúlive‚Äù may not truly be considered a musical \nstyle, live pieces are separated as they raise unique co n-\ncerns such as applause sections, etc.  \n    The ‚ÄúDouble -keyed‚Äù  pieces noted in Table 1 are those \nthat have been annotated by two separate individuals.  As \nTable 1 shows , the majo rity of pieces  (1048 of 1383)  have \nbeen anno tated by two annotators . In addition, each annot a-\ntion of a piece contains two levels of structural h ierarchy. \nThere is a fine -grained annotation and a coarse grain ed an-\nnotation, with each coarse -grained segm ent c omprising one \nor more fine -grained segments. Therefore, a ‚Äúfine‚Äù annot a-\ntion may have form abaabacdaba , with equivalent ‚Äúcoarse ‚Äù \nannotation of AABA  where A represents an aba  \n                                                           \n1 See http://www.quaero.org .  Table 1. Breakdown of the MRX10V2 structure segment a-\ntion dataset by musical style.  \nsequence and B represents a cd sequence.  The ne w dataset \ncontains 1,383 pieces  which is over 4 times larger than ear-\nlier datasets used for evaluation.  \n3. ALGORITHMS  \nThe algorithms used in this off -cycle MIREX  evaluation \nare the same as the  ones submitted to  MIREX  2010 . Five \nunique algorithms, including one with two  distinct  param e-\nter settings  (resulting in six overall algorithms ), were run \nagainst the new  1,383 song  dataset and evaluated . The alg o-\nrithms are referred to in this paper using the code names \nassigned to them during MIREX 201 0.2   \nEach of the algorithms under evaluation is composed of \na unique combination of extracted features, segmentation \nmethods, and labeling/grouping techniques. BV1 -2 [13] \nuses beats, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients ( MFCCs ) \nand chroma vectors  as featur es, segments the song base d on \ngeneralized likelihood s of three  different criteria and gat h-\ners the segments using agglomerative hierarchical  cluste r-\ning. GP7 [12] uses MFCC, c hroma vectors, spectral flatness \nand valley factors as features, calculates a weighted sum of \n4 different distance matrices that is used to segment the \nsignal. The segments are merged using hierarchical aggl o-\nmerative clustering.  MHRAF2 [ 8] uses chroma feat ures and \nemploys string matching techniques to identify strong ha r-\nmonic redundancies using an iterative detection of major \nrepetitions . MND1  [9] uses c hroma vectors  and calculates a \nsimilarity matrix using Pearson 's correlation coefficient. \nMND1  searches t he diagon als for repeated sequences and \nuses a greedy algorithm to decide on the segments.  WB1  \n[16] uses beat sync hronous chromagram s decompo sed into \nbasis patterns by  shift-invariant probabilistic latent comp o-\nnent analysis as features. Song s are segmented by comp u-\nting the path of the basis patterns through a likelihood fun c-\ntion that represents the structure of the song  using the V i-\nterbi algorithm .   \n                                                           \n2 See http://nema/mirex/wiki/2010:MIREX2010  Style  Double -\nkeyed  Single -\nkeyed  Total  Percentage  \nClassical  159 66 225 16% \nJazz 225 12 237 17% \nPopular  205 117 322 23% \nWorld  186 31 217 16% \nLive 273 109 382 28% \nTotal  1048  335 1383  100%  \n56212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n On average , the runtimes for the algorithms is appro x-\nimately  two to six minutes per file. Table 2 present s the a v-\nerage runtimes per -file for each algorithm . We can see that \nmost algorithms run roughly real -time. Therefore, any very \nlarge -scale effort to automatically segment music audio will \nrequire significant computational resources.  \n \nAlgorithms  Average processing time \n(min. / piece)  \nWB1 [ 16] 2.28 \nGP7 [ 12] 2.64 \nBV1 & BV2 [ 13] 2.94 \nMND1 [ 9] 5.60 \nMHRAF2 [ 8] 6.38 \n \n  \n4. EVALUATION AND RESUL TS \n4.1 Evaluation Method s \nThe same evaluation methods and metrics used in previous \nstructural segmentation MIREX evaluations were used to \nevaluate the algorithms. The boundary retrieval metrics of \n[15] evaluate how close segment boundaries between alg o-\nrithm result s and ground truth  are in time . This metric is \nlabel -agnostic and simply measures the segmentation of the \npiece and not whether similar section s are similarly labeled. \nThe ‚Äúhit rate ‚Äù of the boundary retrieval measures if a r e-\nturned segment boundary is within T seconds of a ground \ntruth boundary. The hit rate is measured at two time -\nthresholds: T = 0.5 s and T = 3.0 s. The segment boundary \nhit rat e measures encompass an F-measure ( SBR-F), as well \nas a precision ( SBR-P) and recall ( SBR-R) measure. In add i-\ntion, the median deviation, in seconds, between de tected and ground truth boundaries is measured.  AB-2-RB meas-\nures the median time difference betwe en an annotated \nboundary and the nearest result boundary. Similarly , RB-2-\nAB measures the median time difference between a result \nboundary and the nearest annotated boundary.  \nFrame -pair clustering, as introduced in [ 6], divides the \nresults and ground truth into short time frames (e.g. 100 \nms). This metric then considers every possible pair of \nframes  and their corresponding labels . Denoti ng the set of \nall frame -pairs  that share the same label (i.e. , same cluster) \nin the result as PE, and likewise the set of all frame -pairs \nsharing the same label in the ground truth as PA, we can d e-\nfine the pairwise precision, P, pairwise recall, R, and pai r-\nwise F -measure, F as \n         \n                     \n                 \n                                                          \nThe frame -pair clustering F -measure, precision, and recall \nare to as FPC -F, FPC -P, and FPC -R, respectively.  \nThe normalized conditional entropies introduced in [ 7] \nalso represent st ructural annotations as sequences of short \nframes, similar to the frame -pair clustering metrics. Cond i-\ntional entropies are calculated and normalized to yield a \nmeasure in [0, 1], the details of which are beyond the scope \nof this paper and can be found in t he reference. The norm a-\nlized conditional entropy measures are a dual measure with  \nover-segmentation  (NCE -OSS) and under -segmentation \nscores  (NCE -USS). Because structure annotation can exist \nat multiple levels of granularity (as it does in the  new \nground t ruth), the two metrics will indicate if an algorithm \ntended to be too coarse (low under -segmentation score) or \ntoo fine (low over -segmentation scores). Finally, a random \nclustering index (RCI) measure is also calculated  [5]. Table 2.

Evaluations against coarse (a) and fine (b) ground truth annotations.  \n \n563Poster Session 4\n  \n \n 5.  RESULTS  & DISCUSSION  \nThe evaluation results of the six algorithms  using the new \nMRX10V2 dataset  can be seen in Table s 3a (coarse -\ngrained) and 3b (fine-grained) . The figures in the tables \nrepresent weighted averages over the dataset, where the a v-\neraging was carried out as follo ws. All algorithms were \nevaluated over a single ground truth for the entire annotated \ndataset (~1300 pieces). Those pieces that were double -\nkeyed were then used as a second ground truth and  sepa-\nrately evaluated. These two separate evaluations were then \nweighted by the number of pieces in each set and averaged \nto produce the final results.  \nWe take immediate note that the algorithms tend to per-\nform better when  evaluated using the coarser of the two \nhuman annotations (mostly evidenced by the FPC -F meas-\nure and  low NCE -USS scores in Table 3b).  With regard to \nthe FPC -F data, the average performance for all algorithm s \nusing the coarse -grained  ground truth is 0.520 versus 0.423 \nfor the fin e-grained. A Friedman's ANOVA test1  run using \nthe FPC -F measure data  confirms that there exists a stati s-\ntically significant difference in performance between the \ncoarse and fine result sets ( p=0.0 1). This result is not su r-\nprising, as the algorithms are designed for coarse annot a-\ntion. We will talk about the relative performa nces of alg o-\nrithms using  only the coarse FPC -F scores later.  \nIn comparing the MRX10V2 results with  the previous \nMIREX datasets, we see that the evaluation results for all \nalgorithms seem to be in the same general range . Using \nFPC -F-measure  for comparison  (as it provides a good ba l-\nance between segmentation and labeling accuracy) , Table 4 \ncontains algorithm performances on the new dataset, the \nMIREX 2009 dataset , and the MIREX  2010 dataset. In \ngeneral, average performance seems to be slightly worse  on \nthe new MRX10V2 dataset. Some algorithms seem to have \nbeen more strongly affected, with significant performance \ndrops (e.g. BV2 and GP7). Some algorithms, however, also \nimproved slightly on the MRX10V2  dataset  over the \nMIREX  2009 dataset  (e.g. MND1 and  WB1) . The smallest \ndataset, RWC, appears to generate the best performances.  A \nFriedman's ANOVA test run against the Table 4 data ind i-\ncated a statistically significant difference in performance \namong the three datasets ( p=0.02 ). A subsequent Tukey -\nKramer H onestly Significant Difference (TKHSD) test tells \nus that the MIREX  2010 collection results are significantly \ndifferent than the other two collections. The same TKHSD \nalso shows that MIREX  2009 and MRX10V2 are not di f-\nferent from each other. We suspect that  the MIREX 2010 \nresults are significantly better than the other two datasets \n                                                           \n1 See [2] for an in -depth discussion of the applications of \nFriedman's ANOVA and the Tukey -Kramer Honestly Si g-\nnificant Difference (TKHSD) tests used in MIREX.  because the RWC popular music database which makes up \nthe MIREX 2010 set was artificially  composed and pe r-\nformed  to represent generic popular musi c and to overcome \ncopyright probl ems. \n \nTable 4 . Comparison of algorithms over datasets  \nRecall that the earlier  MIREX datasets have a strong bias \ntoward western popular music.  As mentioned in S ection 2, \nMRX10 V2 dataset was deliberately created to represent a \nwider range of musical styles to evalu ate algorithmic pe r-\nformance across different genres. Table 5 presents a  break-\ndown of algorithm per formance across musical styles.  \nAgain, the  FPC -F measure is used as a summary measure \nfor comparison , and only the coarse annotations are cons i-\ndered . A Friedman's ANOVA test run against the Table 5 \ndata indicates  that there is no statistically significant diffe r-\nences in performance across  musical style s (p=0.9 0). This \nis a promising result because it suggest s that although, to \ndate, most algorithms have b een evaluated on popular m u-\nsic, they do seem to perform reasonably  well on other \nstyles.

Fined -grained vs. coarse -grained FPC -F results.  \n5.1 Best Performances: Algorithms vs. Humans  \nIn order to gain some general idea on how a human might \nperform relative to  another human using the standard  \nevaluat ion measures, the ground trut hs of all double -keyed \nfiles were  compared. We perform ed the human -to-human \ncomparison on both the coarse and fine -grained annotations. \nThe double -keyed subset allows us to evaluate the human -\ngenerated annotations in the same m anner as the alg o-\nrithms. The Human  results li ne in Table 6 was generated by \ndecla ring one human annotation set to be an ‚Äúalgorithm ‚Äù \nwhile the other played the role of ‚Äúground truth. ‚Äù The \nalgorithms were  evaluated on only this subset of the data to \nallow fo r direct comparison o f the results on the 794 \ndouble -keyed pieces that have both fine and coarse \nannotations . \nTable 6 shows that structural annotation by music \nexperts  seems to be  itself somewhat subjective. For \nexample the average coarse -grained FPC -F score is 0.721. \nThis indicates that some disagreement d oes exist amongst \nhuman experts.  A higher degree of disagreement exists for \nthe fine -grained annotations .  \nWhile  algorithmic segmentations seem  to perform \nsimilarly to each other, automatic segmentation has not \nreached human performance. We performed Friedman's \nANOVA on the coarse -grained FPC -F scores for the \nalgorithmic  and  human annotations across 794 tracks. At \np<0.01, the Friedman's test in dicates a statistically \nsignificant difference in performance among the annotation \nsources. The subsequent TKHSD multiple comparison tests \nshow a set of four distinct performance groupings with each \ngroup being significantly different from  the other groups  \n(with no significant differences with each grouping). Figure \n1 presents the results of the TKHSD test.  \nIn the first performance group, we find, by itself, the \nresults for the human annotations. These are noticeably \nbetter than any of the algorithmic results. This is to be \nexpected given the relatively few years the community has \nbe working on the structural  segmentation problem. The \nsecond grouping  (highlighted by an oval in Figure 1)  consists of MHRAF2, MND1, and WB1.  These three \nalgorithms are not significantly different.  BV1, GP7, and \nBV2 all have statistically significant performance \ndifferences . These r esults remind us of t wo important facts. \nFirst, the top performing algorithms are not significantly \ndifferent in the  MIREX 2010 Version 2 evaluations. We \nneed to look at the stronger algorithms as a group to see \nwhat factors can be merged to build an impro ved \nsegementation system. Second, notwithstanding human \nvariations in strucutural annotations, we as a community \nstill have a great way to go before our structural \nsegmentation algorithms can be said to be acheiving \nhuman -like performances . \n  \n  \nFigure 1.

CONCLUSIONS  AND FUTURE WORK  \nIn this paper we reported upon t he most extensive  \nevaluation of music structure segmentation algorithms to \ndate. Our evaluation was performed on a new dataset \nspanning multiple musical styles.  Top-ranked techniques \nfor th e autom atic segmentation of music quantitatively \nperform similarly. Musical style does not seem to have an \nadverse affect on general performance, but individual \nalgorithms have a nonuniform performances across styles.  \nWe can also conclude that the state of automatic \nsegmentation is relatively immature. Even  though we \nassert that structural or formal analysis is in itse lf a \nsubjective endeavor, the comparison of two human \nannotators to one another far outperforms current \nalgorithms. In summary, we have no current single \ntechnique that is  clearly better than the others  and none \napproach the capabilities of a music expert in this task.  \nThe evidence that there is still a large room for \nimprovement of current segmentation algorithms does not \npreclude them from being useful in their present form.

INTRODUCTION\nGiven a vast and constantly growing collection of online\nsongs, music search and recommendation systems increas-\ningly rely on automated algorithms to analyze and index\nmusic content. In this work, we investigate a novel ap-\nproach for automated content-based tagging of music with\nsemantically meaningful tags (e.g., genres, emotions, instru-\nments, usages, etc.). Most previously proposed auto-taggers\nrely either on discriminative algorithms [2, 7, 11‚Äì13], or on\ngenerative probabilistic models, including Gaussian mixture\nmodels (GMMs) [19, 20], hidden Markov models (HMMs)\n[13, 15], hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) [9], code-\nword Bernoulli average models (CBA) [10], and dynamic\ntexture mixture models (DTMs) [5].\nMost generative approaches Ô¨Årst propose a general prob-\nabilistic model ‚Äî the base model ‚Äî that can adequately\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.capture the typical characteristics of musical audio signals.\nThen, for each tag in a given vocabulary, an instance of this\nbase model is Ô¨Åne-tuned to directly model the audio pat-\nterns that are speciÔ¨Åc and typical for songs associated with\nthat tag. For example, Turnbull et. al. [19] propose Gaus-\nsian mixture models (GMMs) over a ‚Äúbag of features‚Äù (BoF)\nrepresentation, where each acoustic feature represents the\ntimbre of a short snippet of audio. Coviello et. al. [5]\nuse dynamic texture mixture models (DTMs) over a ‚Äúbag\nof fragments‚Äù representation, where each fragment is a se-\nquence of acoustic features extracted from a few seconds of\naudio. DTMs capture information about the temporal dy-\nnamics (e.g. rhythm, beat, tempo) of an audio fragment, as\nwell as instantaneous timbral content.\nSuch direct generative approaches may suffer from two\ninherent limitations. First, their Ô¨Çexibility is determined by\nthe choice of the base model. Since different base models\nmay capture complementary characteristics of a musical sig-\nnal, selecting a single base model may restrict the modeling\npower a priori. For example, Coviello et al. [5] reported that\nDTMs are particularly suitable to model tags with signiÔ¨Å-\ncant temporal characteristics, while GMMs are favorable for\nsome tags for which ‚Äútimbre says it all‚Äù. Moreover, speci-\nfying a base model implies setting its time scale parameters.\nThis limits direct generative approaches to detecting musi-\ncal characteristics (timbre, temporal dynamics, etc.) at one\nÔ¨Åxed time resolution, for each tag in the vocabulary. This is\nsuboptimal, since the acoustic patterns that characterize dif-\nferent tags may occur at different time resolutions. Second,\nestimating tag models may require tuning a large number of\nparameters, depending on the complexity of the base model.\nFor tags with relatively few observations (i.e., songs associ-\nated with the tag), this may be prone to overÔ¨Åtting.\nTo address these limitations, we propose to use genera-\ntive models to indirectly represent tag-speciÔ¨Åc musical char-\nacteristics, by leveraging them to extract a high-level song\nrepresentation. In particular, we propose to model a song\nusing a ‚Äúbag of systems‚Äù (BoS) representation for music.\nThe BoS representation is analogous to the ‚Äúbag of words‚Äù\n(BoW) framework employed in text retrieval [1], which rep-\nresents documents by a histogram of word counts from a\n723Poster Session 6\ngiven dictionary. In the BoS approach, each word is a gen-\nerative model with Ô¨Åxed parameters. Given a rich dictio-\nnary of such ‚Äúmusical codewords‚Äù, a song is represented\nby ‚Äúcounting‚Äù the of occurrences of each codeword in the\nsong ‚Äî by assigning song segments to the codeword with\nlargest likelihood. Finally, BoS histograms can be modeled\nby appealing to standard text mining methods (e.g., logis-\ntic regression, topic models, etc.), to obtain tag-level mod-\nels for automatic annotation and retrieval. A BoS approach\nhas been used for the classiÔ¨Åcation of videos [4, 14], and a\nsimilar idea has inspired the anchor modeling for speaker\nidentiÔ¨Åcation [16].\nBy leveraging the complementary modeling power of var-\nious classes of generative models, the BoS approach is more\nÔ¨Çexible than direct generative approaches. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how combining Gaussian and dynamic texture\ncodewords with different time resolutions enriches the rep-\nresentation of a song‚Äôs acoustic content and improves per-\nformance. A second advantage of the BoS approach is that\nit decouples modeling music from modeling tags. This al-\nlows us to leverage sophisticated generative models for the\nformer, while avoiding overÔ¨Åtting by resorting to relatively\nsimpler BoW models for the latter. More precisely, in a Ô¨Årst\nstep, a dictionary of sophisticated codewords may be esti-\nmated from anylarge collection of representative audio data,\nwhich need not be annotated. This allows to learn a general,\nrich BoS representation of music robustly. Next, tagmod-\nels are estimated to capture the typical codeword patterns in\nthe BoS histograms of songs associated with each tag. As\neach tag model already leverages the descriptive power of a\nsophisticated codebook representation, relatively simple tag\nmodels (with fewer tunable parameters) may be estimated\nreliably, even from small sets of tag-speciÔ¨Åc training songs.\nIn summary, we present a new approach to auto-tagging\nthat constructs a rich dictionary of musically meaningful\nwords and represents each song as a histogram over these\nwords. This simple, compact representation of the musical\ncontent of a song is computationally efÔ¨Åcient once learned\nand expected to be more robust than a single low-level audio\nrepresentation. It can beneÔ¨Åt from the modeling capabilities\nof several classes of generative models, and exploit infor-\nmation at multiple time scales.\n2. THE BAG OF SYSTEMS REPRESENTATION OF\nMUSIC\nAnalogous to the BoW representation of text documents, the\nBoS approach represents songs with respect to a codebook,\nin which generative models are used in lieu of words. These\ngenerative models compactly characterize typical audio fea-\ntures, musical dynamics or other acoustic patterns in songs.\nWe discuss codebook generation in Section 2.1, the gen-\nerative models used as codewords in Section 2.2, and therepresentation of songs using the codebook in Section 2.3.\n2.1 Codebook generation\nTo build a codebook, we Ô¨Årst choose Mclasses of base\nmodels (each with a certain allocation of time scale param-\neters). From each model we derive a set of representative\ncodewords, i.e., instances of that model class that capture\nmeaningful musical patterns. We do this Ô¨Årst by deÔ¨Åning a\nrepresentative collection of songs, i.e., a codebook set, Xc,\nand then modeling each song in Xcas a mixture of Ksmod-\nels from each model class. After parameter estimation, the\nmixture components provide us with characteristic instances\nof that model class and become codewords. Finally, we ag-\ngregate all codewords to form the BoS codebook, V, which\ncontains|V|=MKs|Xc|codewords.\nEach codeword in the BoS codebook can be seen as char-\nacterizing a prototypical audio pattern or texture, and code-\nwords from different classes of generative models capture\ndifferent types of musical information. If the codebook set,\nXc, is sufÔ¨Åciently diverse, the estimated codebook will be\nrich enough to represent songs well.\n2.2 The codewords\nTo obtain a diverse codebook, we consider Gaussian mod-\nels (to characterize timbre) and dynamic texture (DT) mod-\nels [6] (to capture temporal dynamics) at various time res-\nolutions. First, a time resolution is chosen by representing\nsongs as a sequence of feature vectors, Y={y1,...,yT},\nextracted from half-overlapping time windows of length Œ∑.\nThe sampling rate and the length Œ∑of the windows deter-\nmines the time resolution of the generative models. Second,\na generative model (Gaussian or DT) is chosen, and mixture\nmodels are estimated for all songs in the codebook set, Xc.\n2.2.1 Gaussian codewords\nTo learn Gaussian codewords, we Ô¨Åt a Gaussian mixture\nmodel (GMM) to each song in Xc, to capture the most promi-\nnent audio textures it exhibits. More speciÔ¨Åcally, for each\nsong inXc, we treat the sequence of its feature vectors, Y,\nas an unordered bag of features, and use the EM algorithm\nto estimate the parameters of a GMM from these features.\nFinally, each mixture component is considered as a code-\nword, characterized by parameters Œòi={¬µi,Œ£i}, where\n¬µiandŒ£iare the mean and covariance of the ithmixture\ncomponent of the GMM, respectively.\n2.2.2 Dynamic Texture codewords\nDynamic texture (DT) codewords are learned by modeling\neach song inXcas a mixture of DTs, and considering each\nindividual DT as a codeword.\nDTs explicitly model the temporal dynamics of audio by\nmodeling ordered sequences of audio features rather than in-\n72412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndividual features. From the sequence of feature vectors ex-\ntracted from a song, Y, we sample subsequences, i.e., frag-\nments,y1:œÑ, of lengthœÑeveryŒΩseconds. We then repre-\nsent the song by an unordered bag of these audio fragments,\nY={y1\n1:œÑ, ..., yT\n1:œÑ}.\nA DT treats an audio fragment y1:œÑas the output of a\nlinear dynamical system (LDS):\nxt=Axt‚àí1+vt, (1)\nyt=Cxt+wt+ ¬Øy, (2)\nwhere the random variable yt‚ààRmencodes the timbral\ncontent (audio feature vector) at time t, and a lower dimen-\nsional hidden variable xt‚ààRnencodes the dynamics of the\nobservations over time. The model is speciÔ¨Åed by param-\neters Œò ={A,Q,C,R,¬µ,S, ¬Øy}, where the state transition\nmatrixA‚ààRn√ónencodes the evolution of the hidden state\nxtover time,vt‚àºN(0,Q)is the driving noise process, the\nobservation matrix C‚ààRm√ónencodes the basis functions\nfor representing the observations yn,¬Øyis the mean of the\nobservation vectors, and wt‚àºN (0,R)is the observation\nnoise. The initial condition is distributed as x1‚àºN(¬µ,S).\nWe model a song by a dynamic texture mixture (DTM)\nthat summarizes the dominant temporal dynamics, where an\nassignment variable z‚àà{1,2,...,Ks}selects which of Ks\nDTs is generating an audio fragment. For a given a song,\nthe DTM parameters are estimated via the EM algorithm [3]\nand, once again each mixture component Œòiis a codeword.\n2.3 Representing songs with the codebook\nOnce a codebook is available, a song is represented by a\ncodebook multinomial (CBM) b‚ààR|V|that reports how\noften each codeword appears in that song, where b[i]is the\nweight of codeword iin the song.\nTo build the CBM for a given song, we count the number\nof occurrences of each codeword in the song by computing\nits likelihood at various points in the song (e.g., every ŒΩsec-\nonds) and comparing it to the likelihood of other codewords\nderived from the same base model class (since likelihoods\nare only comparable between similar models with the same\ntime resolution). To compute the likelihood of a given code-\nword at a certain point in the song, we extract a fragment of\naudio information ytdepending on the time scale and model\nclass of the codeword in question. I.e., for GMM code-\nwords,ytis a single audio feature vector, extracted from\na window of width Œ∑, while for DTM codewords, ytis a se-\nquence ofœÑsuch feature vectors. We count an occurrence of\nthe codeword under attention if it has the highest likelihood\nof all the codewords in that class.\nWe construct the histogram bfor songYby counting the\nfrequency with which each codeword Œòi‚ààV is chosen torepresent a fragment:\nb[i] =1\nM|Ym|/summationdisplay\nyt‚ààYm1[Œòi= argmax\nŒò‚ààVmP(yt|Œò)] (3)\nwhereVm‚äÜV is the subset of codewords derived from the\nmodel class mwhich codeword Œòiis derived. Normalizing\nby the number of fragments |Ym|(according to class m) in\nthe song and the number of model classes Mleads to a valid\nmultinomial distribution.\nWe Ô¨Ånd that the codeword assignment procedure out-\nlined above tends to assign only a few different codewords\nto each song. In order to diversify the CBMs, we general-\nize equation 3 to support the assignment of multiple code-\nwords at each point in the song. Hence, for a threshold\nk‚àà {1,2,...,|Vm|}, we assign the kmost likely code-\nwords (again comparing only within a model class) to each\nfragment. The softened histogram is then constructed as:\nb[i] =1\nM|Ym|/summationdisplay\nyt‚ààYm1\nk1[Œòi= argmax\nŒò‚ààVmkP(yt|Œò)] (4)\nwhere the additional normalization factor of 1/kensures\nthatbis still a valid multinomial for k>1.\n3. MUSIC ANNOTATION AND RETRIEVAL USING\nTHE BAG-OF-SYSTEMS REPRESENTATION\nOnce a BoS codebook Vhas been generated and songs are\nrepresented by codebook histograms (i.e., CBMs), a content-\nbased auto-tagger may be obtained based on this represen-\ntation ‚Äî by modeling the characteristic codeword patterns\nin the CBMs of songs associated with each tag in a given\nvocabulary. In this section, we formulate annotation and\nretrieval as a multiclass multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation of CBMs\nand discuss the algorithms used to learn tag models.\n3.1 Annotation and retrieval with BoS histograms\nFormally, assume we are given a training dataset Xt, i.e., a\ncollection of songs annotated with semantic tags from a vo-\ncabularyT. Each song sinXtis associated with a CBM\nbswhich describes the song‚Äôs acoustic content with respect\nto the BoS codebook V. The songsis also associated with\nan annotation vector cs= (c1,..., c|T|)which express the\nsong‚Äôs semantic content with respect to T, whereci= 1\nifshas been annotated with tag wi‚ààT, andci= 0 oth-\nerwise. A dataset is a collection of CBM-annotation pairs\nXt={(bs,cs)}|Xt|\ns=1.\nGiven a training set Xt, standard-text mining algorithms\nare used to learn tag-level models to capture which patterns\nin the CBMs are predictive for each tag in T. Given the\nCBM representation of a novel song, b, we can then resort to\nthe previously trained tag-models to compute how relevant\n725Poster Session 6\neach tag inTis to the song. In this work, we consider algo-\nrithms that have a probabilistic interpretation, for which it is\nnatural to deÔ¨Åne probabilities p(wi|b), fori= 1,...,|T|,\nwhich we rescale and aggregate to form a semantic multino-\nmial (SMN) p= (p1, ..., p|T|), wherepi‚àùp(wi|b)and/summationtext|T|\ni=1pi= 1. Hence we deÔ¨Åne the relevance of a tag to the\nsong as the corresponding entry in the SMN.\nAnnotation involves selecting the most representative tags\nfor a new song, and hence reduces to selecting the tags with\nhighest entries in p. Retrieval consists of rank ordering a set\nof songsS={s1,s2... sR}according to their relevance\nto a query. When the query is a single tag wifromT, we\ndeÔ¨Åne the relevance of a song to the tag by p(wi|b), and\ntherefore we rank the songs in the database based on the ith\nentry in their SMN.\n3.2 Learning tag-models from CBMs\nThe CBM representation of songs is amenable to a variety of\nannotation and retrieval algorithms. In this work, we investi-\ngate one generative algorithm, Codeword Bernoulli Average\nmodeling (CBA), and one discriminative algorithm, multi-\nclass kernel logistic regression (LR).\n3.2.1 Codeword Bernoulli Average\nThe CBA model proposed by Hoffman et. al. [10] is a gener-\native process that models the conditional probability of a tag\nword appearing in a song. Hoffman et al. deÔ¨Åne CBA based\non a vector quantized codebook representation of songs. For\nour work, we adapt the CBA model to use a BoS codebook.\nFor each song, CBA deÔ¨Ånes a collection of binary ran-\ndom variables yw‚àà{0,1}, which determine whether or not\ntagwapplies to the song. These variables are generated in\ntwo steps. First, given the song‚Äôs CBM b, a codeword zwis\nchosen according to the CBM, i.e., zw‚àºMultinomial (b1,...,\nb|V|). Then a value for ywis chosen from a Bernoulli distri-\nbution with parameter Œ≤kw,\np(yw= 1|zw,Œ≤) =Œ≤zww (5)\np(yw= 0|zw,Œ≤) = 1‚àíŒ≤zww. (6)\nWe use the author‚Äôs code [10] to Ô¨Åt the CBA model. To\nbuild the SMN of a novel song we compute the posterior\nprobabilities p(ywi= 1|b,Œ≤) =piunder the estimated\nCBA model, and normalize p= (p1,...,p|V|).\n3.2.2 Multiclass Logistic Regression\nLogistic regression deÔ¨Ånes a linear classiÔ¨Åer with a prob-\nabilistic interpretation by Ô¨Åtting a logistic function to all\nCBMs associated to each tag:\nP(wi|b,Œ≤i)‚àùexpŒ≤T\nib (7)\nKernel logistic regression Ô¨Ånds a linear classiÔ¨Åer after ap-\nplying a non-linear transformation to the data, œï:Rd‚ÜíRdœï. The feature mapping œïis indirectly deÔ¨Åned via a ker-\nnel function K(a,b) =/angbracketleftœï(a),œï(b)/angbracketright, where aandbare\nCBMs.\nIn our experiments we use the histogram intersection ker-\nnel [17], which is deÔ¨Åned by the kernel function: K(a,b) =/summationtext\njmin(aj,bj). In our implementation we use the software\npackage Liblinear [8] and learn an L2-regularized logistic\nregression model for each tag using the ‚Äúone-vs-the rest‚Äù\napproach. As with CBA, we collect the posterior probabili-\ntiesp(wi|b)and normalize to build the SMN.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n4.1 Music Datasets\nTheCAL500 [19] dataset consists of 502 Western popular\nsongs from 502 different artists. Each song-tag association\nhas been evaluated by at least 3 humans, using a vocabulary\nof 149 tags. CAL500 provides binary annotations, i.e., ci=\n1when a tagiapplies to the song and 0 when the tag does\nnot apply. We restrict our experiments to the 97 tags with\nat least 30 example songs and use 5-fold cross-validation,\nwhere each song appears in the test set exactly once.\nTheCAL10k dataset [18] is a collection of over ten thou-\nsand songs from 4,597 different artists, weakly labeled from\na vocabulary of over 500 tags. The song-tag associations are\nmined from Pandora‚Äôs website. We restrict our experiments\nto the 55 tags in common with CAL500.\n4.2 Codebook parameters\nFor our experiments, we build codebooks using three classes\nof generative models: one class of GMMs and two classes\nof DTMs at different time resolutions. To learn DTM code-\nwords, we use feature vectors consisting of 34 Mel-frequency\nbins. The feature vectors used to learn GMM codewords are\nMel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients appended with Ô¨Årst and\nsecond derivatives (MFCC-delta). Window and fragment\nlength for each class of codewords are speciÔ¨Åed in Table 1.\nModel Class Window length ( Œ∑) Fragment length Fragment step ( ŒΩ)\nBoS-DTM 1 12 ms 726 ms 145 ms\nBoS-DTM 2 93 ms 5.8 s 1.16 s\nBoS-GMM 1 46 ms 46 ms 23 ms\nTable 1 . Time resolutions of model classes\n4.3 Experiments\nOur Ô¨Årst experiment is cross-validation on CAL500, using\nthe training setXtas the codebook set Xcand re-training\nthe codebook for each split. We learn Ks= 4codewords of\neach model class per song. We build 5 codebooks: one for\neach of the 3 classes of codewords, one combining the two\n72612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nclasses of DTM codewords (BoS-DTM 1,2) and one combin-\ning all three classes of codewords (BoS-DTM 1,2-GMM 1).\nThese results are discussed in Section 5.1.\nA second experiment investigates using a codebook set\nXcthat is disjoint from any of the training sets Xt. By\nsamplingXcas a subset of the CAL10k dataset, we illus-\ntrate how a codebook may be learned from any collection\nof songs (whether annotated or not). Training and testing\nof tag models is still performed as Ô¨Åve-fold cross-validation\non CAL500. We perform one experiment with |Xc|= 400 ,\nKs= 4, to obtain a codebook of the same size as those\nlearned on the CAL500 training set. Another experiment\nuses|Xc|= 4,597, for which one song was chosen from\neach artist in CAL10k, and Ks= 2. The results are dis-\ncussed in Section 5.2.\nFinally, we conduct an experiment learning codebooks\nand training tag models on the CAL10k dataset and testing\nthese models on CAL500, in order to determine how well\nthe BoS approach adapts to training on a separate, weakly\nlabeled dataset. We use the same codebook learned from\none song from each artist in CAL10k as above, with |Xc|=\n4,597, andKs= 2 codewords per song for each model\nclass. Now our training set Xtis the entire CAL10k dataset.\nWe train tag models with the settings (regularization of LR,\netc.) found through cross-validation on CAL500, in order\nto avoid overÔ¨Åtting, and test these models on the CAL500\nsongs. These results are discussed in Section 5.3.\n4.4 Annotation and retrieval\nWe annotate each test song CBM with 10 tags, as described\nin Section 3. Annotation performance is measured using\nmean per-tag precision, recall and F-score. Retrieval per-\nformance is measured using area under the receiver oper-\nating characteristic curve (AROC), mean average precision\n(MAP), and precision at 10 (P10) [19].\n5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n5.1 Results on CAL500\nResults on the CAL500 dataset are shown in Table 2. In gen-\neral, we achieve the best results with the softened histogram\nCBM representation (see Section 2.3), using a threshold of\nk= 10 for CBA and k= 5for LR. For comparison we also\nshow results using the hierarchical EM algorithm (HEM) to\ndirectly build GMM tag models (HEM-GMM) [19] and to\ndirectly build DTM tag models (HEM-DTM) [5]. These ap-\nproaches are state of the art auto-tagging algorithms that use\nthe same generative models we use to build BoS codebooks,\nin a more traditional framework. The HEM-GMM experi-\nments use GMM tag models consisting of 4 mixture com-\nponents, with the same audio features as the BoS-GMM 1\nexperiments.

The BoS approach outperforms the direct tag mod-\neling approach for all metrics except precision, where HEM-\nDTM is still best. Additionally, the greatest improvements\nare seen with codebooks that combine the richest variety of\ncodewords. These codebooks capture the most information\nfrom the audio features, which leads to more descriptive tag\nmodels and increases the quality of the tag estimation.\nSince the classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms we use to model tags\nhave fewer parameters than direct tag modeling approaches,\nthe BoS approach is more robust for tags with fewer exam-\nple songs. We demonstrate this in Figure 1, which plots the\nimprovement in MAP over HEM-DTM as a function of the\ntag‚Äôs training set cardinality. The BoS approach shows the\ngreatest improvement for tags with few training examples.\n5.2 Results learning codebook from unlabeled songs\nTable 3 shows results using BoS codebooks learned from\nunlabeled songs.

CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a semantic auto-tagger that leverages a\nrich ‚Äúbag of systems‚Äù representation of music. The latter\ncan be learned from any representative set of songs, which\nneed not be annotated, and allows to integrate the descrip-\ntive quality of various generative models of musical content,\nwith different time resolutions. This approach improves per-\nformance over directly modeling tags with a single type of\ngenerative model. It also proves signiÔ¨Åcantly more robust\nfor tags with few training examples.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, techniques for the separation of musically\nmeaningful sound sources from monaural music recordings\nhave been applied to support many tasks in music infor-\nmation retrieval. For example, by extracting the singing\nvoice, the bassline, or drum and instrument tracks, signif-\nicantimprovementshavebeenreportedfortaskssuchasin-\nstrument recognition [7], melody estimation [1], harmonic\nanalysis [10], or instrument equalization [9]. For the sepa -\nration, most approaches exploit speciÔ¨Åc spectral or tempo-\nral characteristics of the respective sound sources, for ex -\nample the broadband energy distribution of percussive ele-\nments [10] or the spectral properties unique to the human\nvocal tract [1].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this noticeand thefull citation ontheÔ¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011International Society forMusic InformationRetrieval .\n0 2 4 6 8 10C3  E3  G#3 C4  E4  G#4 C5  E5  G#5 \n02468101214160246810121416\n0246810121416\nFigure 1.Decomposition of a piano recording into two sound\nsources corresponding to the left and right hand as speciÔ¨Åed by a\nmusicalscore.

Playedonthesameinstrument\nand often being interleaved, the two sources share many\nspectral properties. As a consequence, techniques that rel y\non statistical differences between the sound sources are no t\ndirectly applicable. To make the separation process feasi-\nble, we exploit the fact that a musical score is available for\nmany pieces. We then use the explicitly given note events\nof the score to approximate the spectrogram of the given\npiano recording using a parametric model. Characterizing\nwhichpartofthespectrogrambelongstoagivennoteevent,\nthe model is then employed to decompose the spectrogram\ninto parts related to the left hand and to the right hand. As\nan application, our goal is to extend the idea of an instru-\nment equalizer as presented in [9] to a voice equalizer that\ncannotonlyemphasizeorattenuatewholeinstrumenttracks\nbutalsoindividualvoicesorevensinglenotesplayedbythe\nsame instrument. While we restrict the task in this paper\nto the left/right hand scenario, our approach is sufÔ¨Åcientl y\ngeneral to isolate any kind of voice (or group of notes) that\nisspeciÔ¨Åed by agiven score.\nSo far, score-informed sound separation has received\n245Poster Session 2\nonly little attention in the literature. In [11], the author s\nreplace the pitch estimation step of a sound separation sys-\ntem for stereo recordings with pitch information provided\nby an aligned MIDI Ô¨Åle. In [6], a score-informed sys-\ntem for the elimination of the solo instrument from poly-\nphonic audio recordings is presented. For the description\nof the spectral envelope of an instrument, the approach re-\nlies on pretrained information from a monophonic instru-\nment database. In [4], score information is used as prior\ninformation in a separation system based on probabilistic\nlatent component analysis (PLCA). This approach is in [8]\ncompared to a score-informed approach based on paramet-\nricatoms. In[9],ascore-informedsystemfortheextractio n\nof individual instrument tracks is proposed. To counterbal -\nancetheirharmonicandinharmonicsubmodels,theauthors\nhave to incorporate complex regulation terms into their ap-\nproach. Furthermore, the authors presuppose that, for each\naudio recording, a perfectly aligned MIDI Ô¨Åle is available,\nwhich isnot arealisticassumption.\nIn this paper, our main contribution is to extend the idea\nof an instrument equalizer to a voice equalizer that does\nnot rely on statistical properties of the sound sources.

PARAMETRIC MODEL\nTo describe an audio recording of a piece of music using\na parametric model, one has to consider many musical and\nacoustical aspects [7,9]. For example, parameters are re-\nquired to encode the pitch as well as the onset position and\nduration of note events. Further parameters might encode\ntuning aspects, the timbre of speciÔ¨Åc instruments, or ampli -\ntude progressions. In this section, we describe our model\nand show how its parameters can be estimated by an itera-\ntive method.  \n1 2 3 4050010001500\n02468101214161820(a)\n  \n00.511.522.5050010001500\n02468101214161820(b)\n  \n1 2 3 4050010001500\n02468101214161820(c)\n  \n1 2 3 4050010001500\n02468101214161820(d)\n  \n1 2 3 4050010001500\n02468101214161820(e)\nFigure2.IllustrationoftheÔ¨Årstiterationofourparameterestima-\ntion procedure continuing the example shown in Figure 1 (shown\nsection corresponds to the Ô¨Årst measure).

Fur-\nthermore, let S:={¬µs|s‚àà[1:S]}denote a set of\nnote events as speciÔ¨Åed by a MIDI Ô¨Åle representing a mu-\nsical score. Here, each note event is modelled as a triple\n¬µs= (ps,ts,ds), withpsencoding the MIDI pitch, tsthe\nonset position and dsthe duration of the note event. Our\nstrategy is to approximate Yby means of a model spectro-\ngramYS\nŒª, whereŒªdenotes a set of free parameters repre-\nsenting acoustical properties of the note events. Based on\nthenoteeventset S,themodelspectrogram YS\nŒªwillbecon-\nstructed as a superposition of note-event spectrograms Ys\nŒª,\ns‚àà[1:S]. More precisely, we deÔ¨Åne YS\nŒªat frequency bin\nk‚àà[1:K]and timeframe n‚àà[1:N]as\nYS\nŒª(k,n) :=/summationdisplay\n¬µs‚ààSYs\nŒª(k,n), (1)\n24612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwhere each Ys\nŒªdenotes the part of YS\nŒªthat is attributed to\n¬µs. EachYs\nŒªconsists of a component describing the ampli-\ntude or activity over time and a component describing the\nspectralenvelopeofanoteevent. Moreprecisely,wedeÔ¨Åne\nYs\nŒª(k,n) :=Œ±s(n)¬∑œïœÑ,Œ≥(œâk,ps), (2)\nwhereœâkdenotesthefrequencyinHertzassociatedwiththe\nk-thfrequencybin. Furthermore, Œ±s‚ààRN\n‚â•0encodestheac-\ntivity of the s-th note event. Here, we set Œ±s(n) := 0, if the\ntimepositionassociatedwithframe nliesinR\\[ts,ts+ds].\nThe spectral envelope associated with a note event is de-\nscribed using a function œïœÑ,Œ≥:R√ó[1 :P]‚ÜíR‚â•0, where\n[1:P]withP=127denotes the set of MIDI pitches. More\nprecisely, to describe the frequency and energy distributi on\nof the Ô¨Årst Lpartials of a speciÔ¨Åc note event with MIDI\npitchp‚àà[1:P], the function œïœÑ,Œ≥depends on a parame-\nterœÑ‚àà[‚àí0.5,0.5]Prelated to the tuning and a parameter\nŒ≥‚àà[0,1]L√óPrelated to the energy distribution over the L\npartials. We deÔ¨Åne for a frequency œâgiven in Hertz the en-\nvelope function\nœïœÑ,Œ≥(œâ,p) :=/summationdisplay\n‚Ñì‚àà[1:L]Œ≥‚Ñì,p¬∑Œ∫(œâ‚àí‚Ñì¬∑f(p+œÑp)),(3)\nwherethefunction Œ∫:R‚ÜíR‚â•0isasuitablychosenGaus-\nsian centered at zero, which is used to describe the shape of\na partial in frequency direction, see Figure 3. Furthermore ,\nf:R‚ÜíR‚â•0deÔ¨Ånedby f(p) := 2(p‚àí69)/12¬∑440mapsthe\npitch to the frequency scale. To account for non-standard\ntunings, we use the parameter œÑpto shift the fundamental\nfrequency upwards or downwards by up to half a semitone.\nFinally,Œª:= (Œ±,œÑ,Œ≥)denotes the set of free parameters\nwithŒ±:={Œ±s|s‚àà[1 :S]}. The number of free param-\neters is kept low since the parameters œÑandŒ≥only depend\non the pitch but not on the individual note events given by\nS. Here, a low number allows for an efÔ¨Åcient parameter es-\ntimation process as described below. Furthermore, sharing\nthe parameters across the note events prevents model over-\nÔ¨Åtting.\nNow, Ô¨Ånding a meaningful parameterization of Ycan be\nformulated as the followingoptimization task:\nŒª‚àó= argmin\nŒª/bardblY‚àíYS\nŒª/bardblF, (4)\nwhere/bardbl¬∑/bardblFdenotes the Frobenius norm. In the following,\nwe illustrate the individual steps in our parameter estima-\ntionprocedureinFigure2,whereagivenaudiospectrogram\n(Figure 2a) isapproximated by our model (Figure 2b-2e).\n2.2 Initializationand Adaption of NoteTiming\nParameters\nTo initialize our model, we exploit the available MIDI in-\nformation represented by S.

Furthermore, we set œÑp:= 0,Œ≥1,p:= 1andŒ≥‚Ñì,p:= 0\nforp‚àà[1 :P],‚Ñì‚àà[2 :L]. An example model spectrogram\nYS\nŒªafter theinitializationisgiven inFigure 2b.\nNext, we need to adapt and reÔ¨Åne the model parameters\nto approximate the given audio spectrogram as accurately\nas possible. This parameter adaption is simpliÔ¨Åed when the\nMIDI Ô¨Åle is assumed to be perfectly aligned to the audio\nrecording as in [9]. However, in most practical scenarios\nsuch a MIDI Ô¨Åle is not available. Therefore, in our ap-\nproach,weemployahighresolutionmusicsynchronization\napproach as described in [3] to adapt the onset positions\nof the note events set S. Based on Dynamic Time Warp-\ning (DTW) and chroma features, the approach also incor-\nporatesonset-basedfeaturestoyieldahighalignmentaccu -\nracy. Using the resulting alignment, we determine for each\nnote event the corresponding position in the audio record-\ning and update the onset positions and durations in Sac-\ncordingly. After the synchronization, the note event set S\nremains unchanged during all further parameter estimation\nsteps. Figure2cshowsanexamplemodelspectrogramafter\nthe synchronization step.\n2.3 Estimationof Model Parameters\nTo estimate the parameters in Œª, we look for (Œ±,œÑ,Œ≥)that\nminimize the function d(Œ±,œÑ,Œ≥) :=/bardblY‚àíYS\n(Œ±,œÑ,Œ≥)/bardblF, thus\nminimizing the distance between the audio and the model\nspectrogram. Additionally, we need to consider range con-\nstraints for the parameters. For example, œÑis required to be\nan element of [‚àí0.5,0.5]P. To approximatively solve this\nconstraintoptimizationproblem,weemployaslightlymod-\niÔ¨Åed version of approach exerted in [2]. In summary, this\nmethod works iteratively by Ô¨Åxing two parameters and by\nminimizing dwithregardtothethirdoneusingatrustregion\nbased interior-points approach. For example, to get a bette r\nestimate for Œ±, we Ô¨ÅxœÑandŒ≥and minimize d(¬∑,œÑ,Œ≥). This\nprocess is repeated until convergence similar to the well-\nknownexpectation-maximizationalgorithm. Figures2dand\n2e illustrate the Ô¨Årst iteration of our parameter estimatio n.\nHere, Figure 2d shows the model spectrogram YS\nŒªafter the\nestimationofthetuningparameter œÑandtheactivityparam-\n247Poster Session 2\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n05101520(a)\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n05101520\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n05101520(b)\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n00.20.40.60.81\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n00.20.40.60.81(c)\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n05101520\n  \n0 5 10 15050010001500\n05101520(d)\n0 5 10 15\n0 5 10 15(e)\nFigure 4.Illustration of our voice separation process continuing the example shown in Figure 1.

VOICESEPARATION\nAftertheparameterestimation, YS\nŒªyieldsanote-wisepara-\nmetricapproximationof Y. Inanextstep,weemployinfor-\nmation derived from the model to decompose the original\naudio spectrogram into separate channels or voices. To this\nend, we exploit that YS\nŒªis a compound of note-event spec-\ntrograms Ys\nŒª. WithT ‚äÇ S, we deÔ¨Åne YT\nŒªas\nYT\nŒª(k,n) :=/summationdisplay\n¬µs‚ààTYs\nŒª(k,n). (5)\nThenYT\nŒªapproximates the part of Ythat can be attributed\ntothenoteeventsin T. Onewaytoyieldanaudiblesepara-\ntionresultcouldbetoapplyaspectrograminversiondirect ly\ntoYT\nŒª. However, to yield an overall robust approximation\nresult our model does not attempt to capture every possi-\nble spectral nuance in Y. Therefore, an audio recording\ndeduced directly from YT\nŒªwould miss these nuances and\nwould consequently sound rather unnatural. Instead, we re-\nvert to the original spectrogram again and use YT\nŒªonly to\nextract suitable parts of Y. To this end, we derive a sepa-\nration mask MT‚àà[0,1]K√óNfrom the model which en-\ncodes how strongly each entry in Yshould be attributed to\nT. More precisely, we deÔ¨Åne\nMT:=YT\nŒª\nYS\nŒª+Œµ, (6)\nwhere the division is understood entrywise. The small con-\nstantŒµ >0is used to avoid a potential division by zero.\nFurthermore, Œµprevents that relatively small values in YT\nŒª\nlead to large masking values, which would not be justiÔ¨Åed\nby themodel. For our experiments, we set Œµ= 10‚àí2.\nFor the separation, we apply MTto a magnitude spec-\ntrogram via\nÀÜYT:=MT‚ó¶Y, (7)where‚ó¶denotes entrywise multiplication (Hadamard prod-\nuct). Theresulting ÀÜYTisreferredtoas estimatedmagnitude\nspectrogram . Here, using a mask for the separation allows\nfor preserving most spectral nuances of the original audio.\nIn a Ô¨Ånal step, we apply a spectrogram inversion to yield an\naudible separation result. Here, a commonly used approach\nis to combine ÀÜYTwith the phase information of the origi-\nnal spectrogram Xin a Ô¨Årst step. Then, an inverse FFT in\ncombinationwithanoverlap-addtechniqueisappliedtothe\nresulting spectrogram [7]. However, this usually leads to\nclicking and ringing artifacts in the resulting audio recor d-\ning. Therefore, we apply a spectrogram inversion approach\noriginally proposed by GrifÔ¨Ån and Lim in [5]. The method\nattenuatestheinversionartifactsbyiterativelymodifyi ngthe\noriginalphaseinformation. Theresulting ÀÜxTconstitutesour\nÔ¨Ånalseparationresultreferredtoas reconstructedaudiosig-\nnal (relativeto T).\nNext, we transfer these techniques to our left/right hand\nscenario. Each step of the full separation process is illus-\ntrated by Figure 4. Firstly, we assume that the score is\npartitioned into S=LÀô‚à™R, whereLcorresponds to the\nnote events of the left hand and Rto the note events of the\nright hand. Starting with the model spectrogram YS\nŒª(Fig-\nure4a)wederivethemodelspectrograms YL\nŒªandYR\nŒªusing\nEqn. (5) (Figure 4b) and then the two masks MLandMR\nusing Eqn. (6) (Figure 4c). Applying the two masks to the\noriginalaudiospectrogram Y,weobtaintheestimatedmag-\nnitude spectrograms ÀÜYLandÀÜYR(Figure 4d). Finally, ap-\nplying the GrifÔ¨Ån-Lim based spectrogram inversion yields\nthe reconstructed audio signals ÀÜxLandÀÜxR(Figure 4e).\n4. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we report on systematically conducted ex-\nperiments to illustrate the potential of our method. To this\nend, we created a database consisting of seven representa-\ntive pieces from the Western classical music repertoire, se e\nTable1.

To this end, we\nused the Mutopia MIDI Ô¨Åles to create two additional MIDI\nÔ¨Åles for each piece using only the notes of the left and the\nright hand, respectively. Using a wave table synthesizer,\nwe then generated audio recordings from these MIDI Ô¨Åles\nwhich are used as ground truth separation results in the fol-\nlowing experiment. We denote the corresponding magni-\ntude spectrograms by YLandYR, respectively. For our\nevaluation we use a quality measure based on the signal-to-\nnoiseratio(SNR)4.Moreprecisely,tocompareareference\nmagnitude spectrogram YR‚ààRK√óN\n‚â•0to an approximation\nYA‚ààRK√óN\n‚â•0wedeÔ¨Åne\nSNR(YR,YA) := 10¬∑log10/summationtext\nk,nYR(k,n)2\n/summationtext\nk,n(YR(k,n)‚àíYA(k,n))2.\nThe second and third column of Table 2 show SNR val-\nues for all pieces, where the ground truth is compared to\nthe estimated spectrogram for the left and the right hand.\nFor example, the left hand SNR for ‚ÄòChop28-15‚Äô is 17.79\nwhereas the right hand SNR is 13.35. The reason the SNR\nbeing higher for the left hand than for the right hand is that\nthe left hand is already dominating the mixture in terms of\noverall loudness. Therefore, the left hand segregation is p er\nse easier compared the the right hand segregation. To indi-\ncate which hand is dominating in a recording, we addition-\nallygiveSNRvaluescomparingthegroundtruthmagnitude\nspectrograms YLandYRtothemixturemagnitudespectro-\ngramY, see column six and seven of Table 2. For example\nfor ‚ÄòChop28-15‚Äô, SNR(YL,Y)=3.48is much higher com-\npared toSNR(YR,Y)=‚àí2.47thus revealing the left hand\ndominance.\n1http://www.mutopiaproject.org\n2http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/SMD/\n3http://www.europarchive.org\n4Even though SNR values are often not perceptually meaningful , they\nat least givesometendencies onthequality ofseparation res ults.IdentiÔ¨Åer SNR SNR SNR SNR SNR SNR\n(YL,ÀÜYL) (YR,ÀÜYR)(YL,ÀÜYL) (YR,ÀÜYR)(YL,Y) (YR,Y)\nprealigned distorted\nBach875 11.24 12.97 11.17 12.89 -1.99 3.03\nBeet31No2 12.65 10.38 12.47 10.23 1.24 -0.09\nBeetOp111 13.21 12.26 12.92 11.99 0.16 0.97\nChop28-01 10.52 13.96 10.43 13.84 -3.38 4.48\nChop28-04 17.63 10.48 17.58 10.45 8.65 -7.55\nChop28-15 17.79 13.35 17.56 13.18 3.48 -2.47\nChop64No1 12.93 11.86 12.60 11.55 -0.06 1.31\nChop66 11.61 11.17 11.46 11.03 -0.41 2.01\nAverage 13.45 12.05 13.27 11.90 0.96 0.21\nTable 2.Experimental results using ground truth data consisting\nof synthesized versionsof the pieces in our database.\nUsing synthetic data, the audio recordings are already\nperfectly aligned to the MIDI Ô¨Åles. To further evaluate the\ninÔ¨Çuence of the music synchronization step, we randomly\ndistorted the MIDI Ô¨Åles by splitting them into 20segments\nof equal length and by stretching or compressing each seg-\nment by a random factor within an allowed distortion range\n(in our experiments we used a range of ¬±50%). The results\nfor these distorted MIDI Ô¨Åles are given in column four and\nÔ¨Åve of Table 2. Here, the left hand SNR for ‚ÄòChop28-15‚Äô\ndecreases only moderately from 17.79(prealigned MIDI)\nto17.56(distorted MIDI), and from 13.35to13.18for the\nright hand. Similarly, the average SNR also decreases mod-\neratelyfrom 13.45to13.27forthelefthandandfrom 12.05\nto11.90fortherighthand,whichindicatesthatoursynchro-\nnization works robustly in these cases. The situation in rea l\nworld scenarios becomes more difÔ¨Åcult, since here the note\nevents of the given MIDI may not correspond one-to-one to\nthe played note events of a speciÔ¨Åc recording. An example\nwillbe discussed inthenext paragraph, see alsoFigure 5.\nAs mentioned before, signal-to-noise ratios and similar\nmeasures cannot capture the perceptual separation quality .\nTherefore, to give a realistic and perceptually meaningful\nimpression of the separation quality, we additionally pro-\nvide a website5with audible separation results as well as\nvisualizations illustrating the intermediate steps in our pro-\ncedure. Here,weonlyusedreal,non-syntheticaudiorecord -\nings from the SMD and EA databases to illustrate the per-\nformance of our approach in real world scenarios. Lis-\ntening to these examples does not only allow to quickly\nget an intuition of the method‚Äôs properties but also to efÔ¨Å-\nciently locate and analyze local artifacts and separation e r-\nrors. For example, Figure 5 illustrates the separation pro-\ncess for ‚ÄòBeetOp111‚Äô using an interpretation by Egon Petri\n(European Archive). As a historical recording, the spectro -\ngramofthisrecording(Figure5c)israthernoisyandreveal s\nsome artifacts typical for vinyl recordings such as rumblin g\nand cranking glitches.

The primary aim of this on-\ntology is to capture the nuances of record production by\nproviding an explicit, application and situation indepen-\ndent conceptualisation of the studio environment. We\nmay use the ontology to describe real-world recording\nscenarios involving physical hardware, or (post) pro-\nduction on a personal computer. It builds on Semantic\nWeb technologies and previously published ontologies\nfor knowledge representation and knowledge sharing.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nRecognising that simple metadata based approaches are\ninsufÔ¨Åcient in complex music information management\nand retrieval scenarios, researchers has been focusing\non using cultural information and the use of content-\nbased features extracted from commercially released au-\ndio mixtures. Certain types of these information are\nrapidly becoming available on the Semantic Web and\nvia a number of Web services. For example, events\n(concerts, tour dates) and artist relations can be obtained\nand used in intuitive ways to Ô¨Ånd connections in mu-\nsic [12]. However, these data remain largely editorial,\nand focussed on artists as opposed to music and pro-\nduction. We argue that another invaluable source of in-\nformation exist, largely neglected to date, pertaining to\nthe composition context, history, production and pre-\nrelease master recordings of music. Due to the lack of\ncomprehensive open standards and methodologies for\ncollecting production information, its use hasn‚Äôt been\nexplored yet.\nWhile music making is an increasingly social activ-\nity, the Semantic Web could become a platform for shar-\ning not just music, but ideas between artists and engi-\nneers. To facilitate this process, our ontologies can be\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies\nare not made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and\nthat copies bear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.utilised to denote information about music production,\nand propagate it through the recording workÔ¨Çow. They\nenable building better models for music information re-\ntrieval (MIR), and answering queries such as: How was\nthis song produced? What effects and parameters were\nused to achieve that particular sound of the guitar? How\nwas the microphone array conÔ¨Ågured when recording\nthis orchestra?\nIn the rest of this paper, we Ô¨Årst discuss why we de-\npart from existing metadata standards, and use Semantic\nWeb technologies and the Music Ontology [20] instead.\nNext, we introduce the Studio Ontology framework fo-\ncussing on its foundations. Finally, we discuss some\napplications and conclude.\n2. RELATED WORK\nNumerous metadata standards are available to capture\nat least parts of the information we outlined previously.\nHowever, their adaptation in audio applications remains\nlow, while a large number of concerns have been re-\nported by researchers, developers and end-users [3], [11],\n[21], [22], [1]. The reasons are complex, and beyond the\nscope of our discussion, see [17], [6]. for thorough re-\nviews. Instead, we summarise the main causes which\nmakes us move away from the adaptation of existing\nmetadata standards.\nPerhaps the most important problem is the prevail-\ning use of XML instead of logical data models. XML\nspeciÔ¨Åes the structure of a document, but it is insufÔ¨Å-\ncient in itself for deÔ¨Åning relationships and constraints\nover a set of terms, hence their meaning remains am-\nbiguous [14]. Interoperability is hindered by the lack\nof semantics, which also prevents automated reasoning\nover data sets. Essential vocabulary terms are scattered\nacross different domains. While harmonisation is pos-\nsible, it requires reverse engineering [3], [11], [1] and\nit remains unclear if and how these efforts can converge\ninto a clear common conceptual model. Finally, the lack\nof shared unique identiÔ¨Åers makes publishing, linking\nand the use of these data difÔ¨Åcult in anything but small\nMIR problems.\nNotable frameworks to facilitate interoperability in\nresearch include ACE XML [16], for sharing content-\n471Poster Session 3\nbased features in MIR, and the Integra Extensible Data\nformat (IXD) [4] linking audio processing and com-\nposition environments such as PD or Max/MSP. These\nXML-based formats however are too speciÔ¨Åc for our\nuse, difÔ¨Åcult to extend, and suffer from the same draw-\nbacks mentioned above. In the next section, we outline\nhow Semantic Web technologies can be used to avoid\nthese drawbacks.\n3. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION IN THE\nRECORDING STUDIO\nThe dual role of the sound engineer can be characterised\nby the aim of fulÔ¨Ålling artistic goals on one hand, and\nby the use of speciÔ¨Åc domain knowledge on the other.\nCapturing this knowledge, the aesthetic choices, and the\nuse of tools in music production workÔ¨Çows is the pri-\nmary focus of our research. It requires formalised data\nmodels and languages to represent, structure, transfer,\nstore and query this information.\nA na ¬®ƒ±ve model for information management simply\nattaches metadata tags to audio items, but further de-\nscriptions of the entities described by tags is not possi-\nble. A relational data model resolves this issue, how-\never its common implementation is not sufÔ¨Åcient in it-\nself for knowledge representation: We can not describe\na hierarchy between tables or constraints over the use of\nterms in relational database schemata. Object orientated\nmodels resolve these limitations, but they have no sound\ntheoretical foundations, do not support efÔ¨Åcient query\nevaluation, or logical reasoning. Graph based models,\nsuch as the Resource Description Framework (RDF)1,\nand expressive Description Logic (DL) [10] and Seman-\ntic Web ontology languages provide a better alternative.\nWe brieÔ¨Çy introduce these techniques next.\n3.1 Semantic Web Technologies\nSemantic Web technologies include Web standards for\ncommunication and information sharing. The Uniform\nResource IdentiÔ¨Åer (URI), provides a unique naming\nscheme for concepts and relationships (resources), while\nRDF allows structuring data using simple statements\nconsisting of subject‚Äîpredicate‚Äîobject triples. A set\nof triples is seen as a graph of semantic relationships.\nEach term is identiÔ¨Åed using a URI, which enables them\nto quote other resources creating a Web of structured\nandlinked data2. RDF ensures clear separation of syn-\ntax from semantics and conceptual model. There are\nconcise human readable serialisations like N33and an\nefÔ¨Åcient query language called SPARQL4supported by\n1http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf- syntax/\n2http://linkeddata.org\n3http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html\n4http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/several databases and open source libraries.\nUsing RDF alone, one can make rather arbitrary state-\nments however, therefore to have common ground for\napplications to interpret our data, we need to be able to\ndeÔ¨Åne, and later refer to concepts such as a Song or an\naudio processing Plugin and its parameters, as well as\ntheir pertinent relationships. Ontology languages pro-\nvide for these deÔ¨Ånitions to be declared, while knowl-\nedge representation schema describing a domain is what\nwe call an ontology .\n3.2 Knowledge Representation and Ontologies\nOntology languages such as the Ontology Web Lan-\nguage (OWL)5are formal languages to express a shared\nconceptualisation6of a domain. Although using a for-\nmal language facilitates syntactic interoperability in it-\nself, making ontological commitments7pertaining to\nthe meaning of terms require higher level constructs of a\nlogical system. The presence or lack of this system sig-\nniÔ¨Åes the difference between data models and knowl-\nedge representations. Most Semantic Web ontologies\nare based on Description Logics corresponding to frag-\nments of First Order Logic for which practical reason-\ning procedures [10] can be created. The Music Ontol-\nogy and the Studio Ontology are published in OWL.\n4. OVERVIEW OF THE MUSIC ONTOLOGY\nThe Music Ontology provides a clear conceptualisation\nof the music domain to facilitate publishing music-related\ndata on the Semantic Web. It was introduced in [20]\nand thoroughly described in [19]. We refer the reader\nto the literature for an introduction and its applications.\nHere, we outline some features which make the Music\nOntology more suitable for our work than its alterna-\ntives [1], [13], [8] [11].\n‚Ä¢Modular and extensible design : Published as a\nmodular ontology library whose components may\nbe reused or extended outside of its framework.\n‚Ä¢WorkÔ¨Çow-based conceptualisation of the music\ndomain: It is built on the life-cycle of intellectual\nworks ‚Äî deÔ¨Åned in the Functional Requirements\nfor Bibliographic Records (FRBR) [18], ‚Äî rang-\ning from abstract to concrete entities: Musical-\nWork ,Expression ,Manifestation ,Item.\n‚Ä¢Event decomposition model: Events are mod-\nelled as Ô¨Årst-class objects with participating agents\nand passive factors, and may be decomposed into\nsub-events.\n5http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/\n6Formally, a set of relations Rover a universe of discourse D. [9]\n7We say that an agent commits to an ontology if its observable\nactions are consistent with the deÔ¨Ånitions in the ontology. [9]\n47212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n‚Ä¢Timelines and temporal entities can be used to\nlocalise events on different timelines: abstract ,\ndiscrete , orcontinuous ;relative , orphysical .\n‚Ä¢Adaptation : It has become a de-facto standard to\npublish music-related data on the web.\nThe above models provide the basis for content an-\nnotation as well as the decomposition of events in com-\nplex workÔ¨Çows, so that we can precisely say who did\nwhat andwhen . While elements of these models can\nalso be found in other ontologies, they are not present\nall at once in a single uniÔ¨Åed framework. The Music\nOntology provides a model to describe the production\nworkÔ¨Çow from composition to delivery, including mu-\nsic recording, but it lacks some very basic concepts to\ndo so in detail. The Studio Ontology Ô¨Ålls this gap.\n5. THE STUDIO ONTOLOGY FRAMEWORK\nThe Studio Ontology8is presented as a modular and\nextensible ontology library. It is designed to reuse exist-\ning terms and models published elsewhere that Ô¨Åt its re-\nquirements. The framework contains some general, do-\nmain independent elements, a set of core concepts and\nrelationships to describe the studio domain, and some\nextensions covering more speciÔ¨Åc areas like microphone\ntechniques and multitrack production tools.\n5.1 Foundational elements\nThe foundational parts of the ontology deal with de-\nscribing tools in audio engineering workÔ¨Çows.\n5.1.1 WorkÔ¨Çows, Events and Timelines\nWe distinguish between two types of workÔ¨Çows: pre-\nscriptive anddescriptive . Prescriptive workÔ¨Çows are\nbest understood as templates describing common data\naccess and manipulation steps. Descriptive workÔ¨Çows\nmay be seen as denotation of speciÔ¨Åc instances of the\nabove, broadly speaking a description of who (orwhat )\nproduced what ,when , and how,using what . Such a de-\nscription requires a workÔ¨Çow based conceptualisation\nof entities existing at various stages. The Music Ontol-\nogy provides such a conceptualisation: A composition\n(MusicalWork ) may be performed producing a sound,\nwhich may be recorded producing a signal ( MusicalEx-\npressions ). We obey this model and hook into it exactly\nat this level. When the sound engineer manipulates a\nsound or a signal, new expressions are created to which\nadditional information can be attached on how it was\nproduced. In order to describe this process, we need\nto be able to talk about events (performance, record-\ning, mixing, transformation), which may be spatially\n8http://isophonics.net/content/studio-ontologyand temporally localised, and linked with agents (engi-\nneer) and factors (tools). We use the Event and Timeline\nOntologies [20] for this purpose. The Music Ontology\nsets aside the problems of how andusing what from the\nworkÔ¨Çow above. We address this issue next.\n5.1.2 Technological Artefacts\nThe Device Ontology can be used to describe artefacts\nof technology. The Device concept may be subsumed\nby anything, a watch, a plugin, or a microphone in a\nmore speciÔ¨Åc ontology. Our ontology generalises con-\ncepts from [7], [2], which are speciÔ¨Åc for their applica-\ntion domains, namely smart phones and computer net-\nworks. Similarly to the Event and Timeline Ontologies,\nthe Device Ontology approaches a foundational domain\nindependent status in the sense described in [15]\nrdfs:subClassOfrdfs:subClassOfdevice:servicedevice:statedevice:Devicedevice:component\ndevice:AbstractDevicedevice:PhysicalDevicedevice:Statedevice:Service\nFigure 1 . Overview of the Device Ontology\nA device may participate in an event as a passive fac-\ntor, providing a particular service in a particular state.\nAstate may be useful to represent a conÔ¨Åguration , such\nas the polar pattern or sensitivity settings of a micro-\nphone during a recording. We borrow knowledge repre-\nsentation elements from the OWL description of UML\nstate machines of [5]. This resembles the paradigm of\nevent driven Ô¨Ånite state machines, in that it describes\nevents related to an application of a device as reason for\nstate changes. Events are tied together as sub-events of\na main event. This has the beneÔ¨Åt of encoding chains\nof state changes (in a temporal context), and the ability\nto assign additional information to entry and exit condi-\ntions modelled as events themselves. This may be a link\nto an engineer to encode details such as an option turned\non by one engineer and then turned off by another, or\nclassiÔ¨Åcations of change events, such as automatic con-\ntrol, fault conditions or engineering decisions.\nOur ontology commits to a categorical distinction\nbetween physical and abstract devices, which worth mak-\ning for the following considerations. Physical and ab-\nstract objects have different primary characteristics. For\ninstance, physical devices have size and weight, and\nmay be decomposed into physical or abstract compo-\n473Poster Session 3\nnents, such as an extension module or Ô¨Årmware. Ab-\nstract devices on the other hand may be intangible mod-\nels of physical devices. Form a mereological point of\nview our model expresses a partial order relation on the\nset of components of a device, which is a reÔ¨Çexive, tran-\nsitive and anti-symmetric property9.\n5.1.3 Signal Processing Devices\nAn important class of devices in music production are\ntools for manipulating audio signals. We deÔ¨Åne the con-\ncept SignalProcessingDevice as a subclass of the more\ngeneral device concept described in ¬ß5.1.2, having in-\nputs and outputs for signal connectivity. From an onto-\nlogical point of view this is sufÔ¨Åcient to identify a sig-\nnal processing device. It is interpreted broadly, and may\nstand for anything from a basic Ô¨Ålter to a complex unit\nsuch as a mixing console or an audio effect. The con-\ncept is deÔ¨Åned in a dedicated ontology called the Signal\nProcessing Device Ontology, together with some funda-\nmental signal processing components.\n5.1.4 Device Connectivity\nThe Connectivity Ontology allows for describing how\nsignal processing devices, or other tools, such as mi-\ncrophones, in a recording and processing workÔ¨Çow are\ninterconnected. Its paramount concept Terminal repre-\nsents inputs and outputs in an abstract way, encompass-\ning electrical or software interfaces and may be linked\nwith a particular physical connector and communica-\ntion protocol. In Ô¨Ågure 2 we illustrate its basic struc-\nture. The exempliÔ¨Åed instances of Connector andPro-\ntocol can be thought to represent the output of a digital\nmicrophone having a 3 pin male XLR connector, and\nusing the AES42 digital microphone interface protocol.\nThe ontology deÔ¨Ånes some individuals of connectors\nand protocols common in audio production. An inter-\nesting feature of the ontology is that we can use it to\nmatch signal characteristics to interface characteristics,\nfor instance the number of accepted channels.\n5.2 Core components\nThe core Studio Ontology parallels the three levels of\nexpressiveness of the Music Ontology and provides stu-\ndio speciÔ¨Åc extensions. On the Ô¨Årst level it provides for\ndescribing recording studios and facilities. For exam-\nple, we can differentiate between commercial, project\nand home studios, different audio engineering roles such\nas mixing or mastering engineer, describe various record-\ning rooms and the equipment in them. This includes a\nlarge vocabulary of tools with top level concepts such as\nAmpliÔ¨Åer ,Analyser ,MixerDevice ,MonitoringSystem ,\nEffectUnit ,DigitalAudioWorkstation orPlugin .\n9Note that it requires OWL2 to express all constraints.rdfs:subClassOfrdfs:subClassOfcon:connectorcon:protocolcon:Terminal\ncon:OpticalTerminalcon:ElectricalTerminalcon:Protocolcon:Connector\nrdfs:subClassOfrdfs:subClassOfcon:AnalogTerminalcon:DigitalTerminalcon:XLR_3Mrdf:typecon:AES42rdf:type\nFigure 2 . Overview of the Connectivity Ontology (with\nsimpliÔ¨Åed examples)\nThe second level includes complex events such as\ndifferent types of recording and post production ses-\nsions, and provides for describing the production work-\nÔ¨Çow on the level of audio transformations and signal\nprocessing as described in ¬ß5.2.1\nThe third level provides some extension points to de-\nscribe speciÔ¨Åc tools, such as multitrack audio produc-\ntion software (see ¬ß5.3.4); the audio editing workÔ¨Çow\nand project structure.\n5.2.1 Signal Processing WorkÔ¨Çows\nTo describe how a piece of music is processed in the\nstudio, it is insufÔ¨Åcient in itself to describe a signal Ô¨Çow\n(i.e. Ô¨Çow chart) or a set of transformations. We need\nto consider a random set of mixing or transformation\nevents, as in non-linear editing, as well as real-rime,\nquasi-simultaneous10transformations, such as a signal\nrouted through several processing units for recording.\nTo fulÔ¨Ål both requirements, we consider parallel signal\nand event Ô¨Çows linked using signal entities that are in-\nstances of the mo:Signal concept. This is illustrated\nin Ô¨Ågure 3. The concepts Recording, Mixing, andTrans-\nform are subclasses of Event deÔ¨Åned in the Event Ontol-\nogy (see ¬ß5.1.1) while MixerDevice andEffectUnit sub-\nsume SignalProcessingDevice deÔ¨Åned in ¬ß5.1.3. Sev-\neral signals (not shown for brevity) can be attached to a\nmixing event and corresponding device. This set up sig-\nniÔ¨Åes our ontological commitment to changing identi-\nties, a problem thoroughly discussed in philosophy [23].\nOnce transformed, a signal receives new identity which\nalleviates difÔ¨Åcult transaction management problems in\nour system regarding the changing attributes of signals.\n5.3 Extensions\nOntology extensions are useful to allow the user to choose\na desired level of granularity, given some domain spe-\n10Apart from the small latency of signal processing units, these\nhave the same duration as the recording event itself.\n47412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nsignal flowRecordingSessionPostProductionSessionevent flow\nmo:Music Ontologystudio:Studio Ontologycon:Connectivity Ontologymo:Recordingcon:Output Terminalstudio: Microphonestudio:microphonedevice:outputstudio:signalmo:produced_signalcon:Output Terminalstudio:Mixing Consoledevice:outputcon:Input Terminalstudio:signalstudio:produced_signalstudio:consoledevice:inputcon:Output Terminalstudio:Effect Unitdevice:outputstudio:signalcon:Input Terminalconsumed_signalstudio:signalstudio:produced_signalstudio:effectdevice:inputstudio:Transformstudio:Mixingstudio:signalmo:Signalmo:Signalmo:Signalconsumed_signalstudio:studio:\nFigure 3 . Recording, mixing and transformation events with an associated signal Ô¨Çow\nciÔ¨Åc details provided by the modeller. In this section we\ndescribe some extensions of the Studio Ontology.\n5.3.1 Audio Recording\nThe Microphone Ontology includes a small taxonomy\nof microphones organised by their transducer principle\n(i.e. CondenserMicrophone, RibbonMicrophone etc...).\nIt also allows for describing most properties one may\nÔ¨Ånd in a microphone data sheet, for instance diaphragm\ntype andsizeorpolar pattern . The ConÔ¨Åguration con-\ncept (subclass of device:State ) can be used to de-\nscribe variable parameters of microphones such as sen-\nsitivity, or variable polar pattern setting, in a particular\nrecording event. The ontology includes the concept Mi-\ncrophoneArrangement and allows for describing stereo\nand spatial recording techniques, such as a Blumlein-\nPair orDeccaTree , with their constituent microphones,\nand their distances, angles and conÔ¨Ågurations.\n5.3.2 Audio Mixing\nThe Audio Mixer Ontology allows detailed description\nof mixing consoles both in terms of static characteris-\ntics and particular settings (such as channel strip con-\nÔ¨Åguration) in an event. The ontology is modelled after a\ngeneralised blueprint of mixing consoles obtained from\nstudying several commercial hardware designs, how-\never software implementations were also taken into ac-\ncount. It deÔ¨Ånes concepts such as Channel, Bus orIn-\nsertTerminal and properties to describe fader levels, pan-\nning, equalisation (linked to an Audio Effect Ontology)\nand routing in a particular event, including automation.\n5.3.3 Audio Effects\nThe core ontology includes concepts to refer to audio\neffect units and plugins that are particular hardware or\nsoftware devices, and a small taxonomy of audio ef-\nfects based on their typical applications in audio engi-\nneering. However, audio effects are best conceptualised\nas physical phenomena, separated from implementation\n(circuit designs or algorithms), concrete devices, and\ntheir applications to signals. Therefore, we have fourconceptual layers which include the concepts: AudioEf-\nfect,Model ,Implementation ,EffectDevice ,Transform .\nThe Studio Ontology sets the problem of implementa-\ntion details aside. Creating an Audio Effects Ontology\nbased on multidisciplinary classiÔ¨Åcation [24] is ongoing\nwork in our lab.\n5.3.4 Audio Editing\nModern digital audio workstations organise recording\nprojects into a set of tracks ‚Äî which may correspond to\ninput channels or created in an ad hoc way ‚Äî and poten-\ntially overlapping clips contained in them correspond-\ning to various takes during a recording session. The\nMultitrack Ontology relates the the hierarchy of Clips\nandTrack s to other concepts in the Music and Studio\nontologies. It deÔ¨Ånes terms such as MultitrackProject ,\nMediaTrack ,AudioTrack , and AudioClip [6].\nA small Edit Ontology provides for describing a suc-\ncession of edit decisions modelled as events linked to\nthe universal timeline using event:time and the au-\ndio signal timeline using edit:media_time . These\nontologies may be subsumed to describe operations in a\nspeciÔ¨Åc tool such as a multitrack audio editor.\n6. APPLICATIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe ability to provide machine-processable representa-\ntions of the information one may Ô¨Ånd on web pages\nof recording studios is a contribution to the Semantic\nWeb in itself. It facilitates Ô¨Ånding studios with speciÔ¨Åc\nequipment or personnel using complex queries. How-\never, a more signiÔ¨Åcant beneÔ¨Åt comes with the ability\nto denote how a piece of music was produced. We can\nargue that contributions form the producer or the sound\nengineer are just as important in modern music as com-\nposition, but we had no way to record his/her actions\nand choices with the transparency music is denoted us-\ning scores. Collecting these data in production is a sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant effort, however a lot can be done automatically\nif ontology based models are available in digital mix-\ning consoles and post production tools. The Meta Ob-\n475Poster Session 3\nject Facility SpeciÔ¨Åcation11enables source code gener-\nation from conceptual models. To take the continuously\nevolving nature of ontologies into account, we provide\nan alternative using run-time model generation [6].\n7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nWe presented a novel conceptualisation of the record-\ning studio environment and its implementation as a Se-\nmantic Web ontology. Our framework is unique in it-\nself, therefore we have no grounds for direct compar-\nison, but we evaluated it against a music production\ntext corpus, and found that it has good lexical coverage,\nand represents approximately 75% of commonly occur-\nring production situations. Further extensions remain\nfuture work, as well as audio editor prototypes which\nenable automatic collection of production information,\nand provide easy to use data entry facilities for captur-\ning data external to a computer system. However, to\nachieve its full potential, our system should be included\nin digital music production tools.\n8. REFERENCES\n[1]R. Arndt, R. Troncy, S. Staab, L. Hardman, and\nM. Vacura.

INTRODUCTION\nAudio identiÔ¨Åcation consists of retrieving the meta data as-\nsociated with an unknown audio excerpt. The typical use\ncase is the music identiÔ¨Åcation service which is nowadays\navailable on numerous mobile phones. The user captures\nan audio excerpt with his mobile phone microphone and\nthe service returns metadata such as the title of the song,\nTHIS WORK WAS ACHIEVED AS PART OF THE QUAERO PRO-\nGRAMME, FUNDED BY OSEO, FRENCH STATE AGENCY FOR IN-\nNOV ATION.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.the artist, the album... Other applications include jingle de-\ntection, broadcast monitoring for statistical purposes or for\ncopyright control (see [1] for more details).\nAudio Ô¨Ångerprint is the most common way of performing\naudio identiÔ¨Åcation when no meta data has been embedded\nin the unknown audio excerpt. It consists of extracting from\neach audio reference a compact representation (the Ô¨Ånger-\nprint) which is then stored in a database. When identifying\nan unknown excerpt, its Ô¨Ångerprint is calculated. Then the\nbest match with the unknown Ô¨Ångerprint is looked for in\nthe database. The difÔ¨Åculty is dual. First, the captured sig-\nnal has undergone a series of distortions (equalization, con-\nversion, time-stretching, pitch-shifting, reverberation, ...).\nSecond, the algorithm has to manage a database containing\nhuge amounts of audio references.\nAudio Ô¨Ångerprint has been dealt with in many previous\nworks. Two main trends can be observed: exact-hashing\nand approximate-search. Exact hashing algorithms [2, 3]\nstate that there are features in the signal which are preserved\nagainst the distortions. They extract these features and use\na hash table to do the matching. Approximate search al-\ngorithms [4, 5] decode the unknown excerpt on a given al-\nphabet and look for the closest transcription in the database.\nA variant is proposed in [6] where the unknown excerpt is\ndecoded on different alphabets according to the references.\nThe best-suited (with respect to the unknown excerpt) al-\nphabet gives the closest reference.\nIn this work, we propose a novel audio Ô¨Ångerprint method\nbased on hashing with a particular focus on robustness to\npitch-shifting. Indeed, this distortion appears to be quite\ncommon in radio broadcasts and taking it into account al-\nlows us to show excellent results on a radio-monitoring ori-\nented evaluation.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the Ô¨Årst section, we\ndescribe the broadcast monitoring use case. It is a typical\napplication for Ô¨Ångerprinting that constitutes a demanding\nevaluation framework for the algorithms. It includes a wide\nvariety of distortions that are actually performed by the ra-\ndio stations. The whole methodology described in this paper\ncan however be easily transposed to any other use case. In\n121Poster Session 1\nthe second section, we describe in detail our method for Ô¨Ån-\ngerprinting. This includes the Ô¨Ångerprint model, the search\nstrategy and the post-processing designed to prevent false\nalarms. We also describe an optional step of database prun-\ning allowing a lower computation time while keeping a high\nratio of identiÔ¨Åcation. In the last section we show the results\nof experiments performed on real broadcast data.\n2. BROADCAST MONITORING\n2.1 Use case description\nThe task consists of detecting the broadcasting of any audio\nreference of a given database in an audio stream. Practically\nthe database will be a set of songs and the stream will be the\none of a radio station. We have to note that the broadcast\nstream not only contains references but also non-referenced\nitems (such as advertisements, speech, unreferenced songs).\nAlso the broadcast references have undergone a series of\nprocesses applied by the radio station, such as: compression,\nequalization, enhancement, stereo widening, pitch-shifting,\n... (see [4] for more details about the radio stations process-\ning). If we denote by m1, m2, ..., m Nthe references, by\nÀúm1,Àúm2, ...,ÀúmNtheir broadcast (and distorted) versions and\nbynthe rest of the broadcast (considered as noise for the\nalgorithm), the task can be illustrated as in Figure 1.\nn Àúmk1 n Àúmk2Àúmk3 n timedetection\nmk1detection\nmk2detection\nmk3\nFigure 1 : Broadcast monitoring\n2.2 Focus on pitch shifting\nThe large majority of the methods from the state of the art\nrely on a spectral representation of the signal. Therefore\nthese methods are possibly sensitive to modiÔ¨Åcations of the\nfrequency content [7].\nA very common distortion in the radio broadcasts is pitch-\nshifting. When this distortion occurs, all the frequencies in\nthe spectrum are multiplied by a factor K. Pitch-shifting\ncould be generated on its own by some signal processing on\nthe frequency content. But in the context of the radio broad-\ncasts, it is strongly linked with time-stretching. Indeed, the\nradio stations frequently shorten the music they play. To this\nend, most radio sound engineers will simply accelerate the\nreading of the music (by changing the sampling rate). This\nwill change the duration of the music, but will also cause\npitch-shifting as a side effect. This processing allows thestations to precisely Ô¨Åt their time constraints and to give the\nimpression that the music is more lively in their broadcasts.\n3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW\n3.1 Architecture\nAs shown in Figure 2, the system is made of four units.\nFirst, the audio stream is cut in analysis frames of length la\nwith an overlap oa. The Ô¨Ångerprint of each analysis frame\n(called frame-based Ô¨Ångerprint) is calculated according to\nthe methodology described in section 3.2. The matching\nunit then Ô¨Ånds in the database the best match to the frame-\nbased Ô¨Ångerprint. Finally, the best match is post-processed\nin order to discriminate out-of-base queries (when the audio\nstream corresponds to none of the references).\nStream Framing Fingerprint\nMatchingPost-\nprocessingIdentiÔ¨Åcation\nReferences\nÔ¨Ångerprints\nFigure 2 : Architecture of the system\n3.2 Fingerprint\nOur Ô¨Ångerprint relies on a spectrogram calculated with ‚Äùcon-\nstant Q transforms (CQT)‚Äù [8] [9]. The constant Q trans-\nform is well adapted to musical signals in the sense that\nits frequency bins are geometrically spaced. As the notes\nof the western scale are geometrically spaced as well, this\ntransform yields a constant number of bins per note. More-\nover pitch-shifting becomes a translation in the CQT do-\nmain. That is, a frequency which is located in bin bwill have\nits pitch-shifted version located in bin b+K/prime. In our imple-\nmentation, we use a CQT with 3 bins per note performed on\nframes of signal with a 10ms increment.\nIn order to compact the spectrogram, we use a 2 dimen-\nsional peak-picking inspired by [2]. We tile the spectrogram\nwith rectangles of width ‚àÜTseconds and height ‚àÜBbins of\nfrequency (typical values for ‚àÜTand‚àÜBare‚àÜT= 0.4s,\n‚àÜB= 12 bins). In each rectangle, we set the maximum\npoint to 1 and all the other points to 0. The result is a binary\nspectrogram containing sparse points at 1. They correspond\nto the points with the highest energy in the original spectro-\ngram.\n12212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nThe methodology used ensures that there is one point set\nto 1 per rectangle of size ‚àÜT√ó‚àÜB(2-dimensional homo-\ngeneity). Thus, this representation is robust to compres-\nsors (which change the dynamic of the audio with respect\nto time) and equalizers (which change the dynamic of the\naudio with respect to frequency). Furthermore, the fact that\nwe do only keep points with maximum energy makes the\nrepresentation robust to most additive noises.\n3.3 Indexing the references\nAs we are dealing with an exact-hashing approach, the match-\ning step relies on the indexing of the references. As Wang\nsuggests, we use pairs of peaks (points set to 1 in the Ô¨Ån-\ngerprint step) to index the Ô¨Ångerprints of the references. We\nwill Ô¨Årst describe how to encode a pair of peaks. Then we\nwill describe the hash function.\nt1andt2being the times of occurrence of the two peaks\ninvolved in a pair, b1andb2being their frequency bins, the\nencoding we suggest for a pair of peaks is the following:\n[/hatwideb1;b2‚àíb1;t2‚àít1]\nwith/hatwideb1=‚åäb1\n6‚åã, a sub-resolved version of b1. The Ô¨Årst\ncomponent (/hatwideb1) is a rough frequency location of the pair\nof peaks. The second component ( b2‚àíb1) is the spectral\nextent of the pair in the CQT domain. The third compo-\nnent ( t2‚àít1) is its time extent. This encoding has sev-\neral advantages. As it only takes into account relative time\ninformation, it is robust to cropping. Also, it is robust to\npitch-shifting. Indeed the use of the constant Q transform\nimplies the pitch-shifting invariance for the second compo-\nnent: a reference having peaks at frequency bins b1andb2\nwill have them at frequencies b1+K/primeandb2+K/primein its\npitch-shifted version. And we actually have:\n(b2+K/prime)‚àí(b1+K/prime) =b2‚àíb1 (1)\nThe Ô¨Årst component ( /hatwideb1) is chosen on a sufÔ¨Åciently coarse\nrepresentation (bin resolution divided by 6) to make it in-\nvariant with the common pitch-shifting ratios ( ‚â§5%). It\nis worth mentioning that pitch-shifting will still move some\npairs close to the border of one sub-resolved bin to the next.\nHowever, similarly to Wang‚Äôs methodology, an exact match-\ning of all pairs is not required. Indeed, the histogram step\ndescribed thereafter only requires that the majority of the\npairs are preserved.\nAs for the hash function, we build an index over all the\npairs of peaks of all the references. More precisely, we build\na function h1which, for any pair of peaks preturns all the\nreferences containing this pair with the time of occurrence\nofpin the references.\nh1:p/mapsto‚àí‚Üí{ (mi, tp,m i)/p occurs in miattp,m i}(2)Let us note that in order to prevent an explosion of the\nnumber of pairs, we only consider pairs of peaks whose\nspectral extent is smaller than a threshold ‚àÜbmaxand whose\ntemporal extent is smaller than a threshold ‚àÜtmax (typical\nsetup for this limitation is ‚àÜtmax = 1.2s and ‚àÜbmax =\n24bins).\n3.4 Matching\nWhen identifying the Ô¨Ångerprint of an analysis frame, we\nextract all its pairs of peaks with their times of occurrence\n{(p, tp,af)}. Thanks to the hash function h1we can efÔ¨Å-\nciently compute the differences {tp,m i‚àítp,af}for all pairs\nof the frame-based Ô¨Ångerprint and for each reference mi.\nWe store these differences in histograms (one histogram per\nreference).\nIf the analysis frame is actually an excerpt of the refer-\nencem0starting at time s, them0histogram will show a\nmaximum at value s. Moreover this maximum should be\nhigher than any other histogram maximum. Indeed if the\nanalysis frame corresponds to m0its Ô¨Ångerprint will have\nmore pairs in common with m0‚Äôs Ô¨Ångerprint than with any\nother reference Ô¨Ångerprint. Furthermore, the pairs should all\noccur in the frame-based Ô¨Ångerprint sseconds earlier than in\nthe reference‚Äôs. Thus the histogram should show a majority\naccumulation for this reference at this value.\nSo, in order to perform the identiÔ¨Åcation we look for the\nreference whose histogram has the highest maximum. This\nreference is considered to match the analysis frame. The\nargument of the maximum of the histogram gives the start\ntime of the analysis frame in the reference.\n3.5 Post-processing\nFor any analysis frame, the matching unit returns its best\nmatch among the references. This means that the case of an\nout-of-base query is not managed.\nA simple approach would consist of setting a threshold\non the common number of pairs between the frame-based\nÔ¨Ångerprint and its best match. If the frame-based Ô¨Ånger-\nprint has more than threshold pairs in common with the best\nmatch, we deduce that the identiÔ¨Åcation is correct. Other-\nwise we deduce that this is an out-of-base query. Unfortu-\nnately, on real data with classical distortions such a thresh-\nold is virtually impossible to setup. It happens that, due to\nthe distortions applied to the stream, a best match has a low\nnumber of pairs in common with the frame-based Ô¨Ånger-\nprint even though it is a correct identiÔ¨Åcation. Besides, such\nathreshold would depend on the transmission channel and\nwould have to be tuned for each different use case.\nThis is why we propose a post-processing unit based on\na majority vote. The unit considers Psuccessive analysis\nframes{aj}j=1..Pand their matching results (mj, sj). If\namong these PidentiÔ¨Åcations, more than Tvoteof them are\n123Poster Session 1\ncoherent the best match is considered to be a correct identiÔ¨Å-\ncation. Otherwise, it is an out-of-base query. Two matching\nresults (mi,‚àÜti)and(mj,‚àÜtj)of the ithand the jthanal-\nysis frames are coherent if:\n/braceleftbiggmi=mj\nsi‚àíi.la.(1‚àíoa) =sj‚àíj.la.(1‚àíoa)(3)\nTvotecan take any integer value between 0andP. A small\nvalue for Tvotewill increase the risk of false alarms whereas\na high value for Tvotewill increase the risk of missed detec-\ntions. In practice, a reasonable value for Tvoteis:\nTvote=/ceilingleftbiggP\n2/ceilingrightbigg\n(4)\n3.6 Database pruning\nWe propose an optional step meant to decrease the complex-\nity of the overall processing. First, we deÔ¨Åne a simpliÔ¨Åed\nhashing function which, for each pair of spectral peaks, re-\nturns only the references possessing that pair.\nh2:p/mapsto‚àí‚Üí{ mi/ poccurs in mi} (5)\nNbeing the total number of references, we deÔ¨Åne the sig-\nniÔ¨Åcance of a spectral pair pby:\ns(p) =N‚àícard(h2(p))\nN(6)\nBasically a pair which appears in many references will not\nbring a lot of information during the identiÔ¨Åcation process\n(and thus has a low signiÔ¨Åcance). Furthermore, it will in-\ntervene in many reference histograms and will thus involve\nmany calculations. On the other hand, a pair which points\nto a small number of references allows to converge more\nquickly towards the best match.\nPruning the database consists of, for a given threshold\nTprune , erasing from the database all the pairs verifying\ns(p)< Tprune . When doing so, we suppose that for any\nreference there will be a sufÔ¨Åcient number of pairs kept in\norder to ensure a correct identiÔ¨Åcation. This, of course, de-\npends on the statistical distribution of the pairs and on the\nselected threshold Tprune . We have experimentally veriÔ¨Åed\nthat the use of a reasonable threshold leads to a signiÔ¨Åcant\ncomplexity gain while keeping similar performances (see\nsection 4.3.4).\n4. EV ALUATION\n4.1 Framework\nThe evaluation framework used in this work is similar to the\none developed in the European project OSEO-Quaero1. It\n1http://quaero.orgis deÔ¨Åned as follows. The audio stream is the broadcast of\na radio station. As the corpus comes from real radio broad-\ncasts, it potentially contains all the radio sound processing\nwe described (see section 2). The references are 1 minute-\nlong excerpts of songs. The broadcast stream has been man-\nually annotated and can thus serve for direct evaluation. For\neach broadcast reference, the annotation states the identiÔ¨Åer\nof the reference, its broadcast time and duration.\nThe task of the algorithm is to scan the broadcast and\noutput a detection message whenever a song among the ref-\nerences occurs in the stream. The algorithm gives the iden-\ntiÔ¨Åer of the detected song as well as its occurrence time. If\nthe detection time is comprised between the annotated start\ntime and the annotated end time of one occurrence of the\nsame song, we make this occurrence a detected occurrence .\nLet us note that multiple detection messages of the same oc-\ncurrence will be counted only once. If the algorithm detects\na song during an empty slot, or during a slot containing an-\nother song, we count one false alarm. We do not limit the\ncounting of false alarms.\n4.2 Comparative experiment\n4.2.1 Objectives\nWe have compared three different algorithms according to\nthe framework described above. The Ô¨Årst one (‚ÄúWang‚Äù) is\nour own implementation of Wang‚Äôs method [2]. The second\none (‚ÄúI B&S‚Äù) is the algorithm called IRCAM Bark & Sone\nin [10]. The last one (‚ÄúSAF‚Äù, for Scalable Audio Fingerprint\nmethod) is the method exposed in this article.\nAs far as our implementations are concerned (Wang and\nSAF), they both rely on the same architecture, as described\nin section 2. All the parameters which are not directly linked\nto the Ô¨Ångerprint (framing parameters and post-processing\nparameters) are the same for both algorithms. In other words,\nthe two systems have the same architecture with the same\nparameters. Only the Ô¨Ångerprint model does differ.\n4.2.2 Data\nIn this experiment, the stream is made of 7 days of the French\nradio RTL. The one minute long references are extracted\nfrom 7309 songs. The broadcast stream contains 459 occur-\nrences of these references.\nLet us note that it happens that a given version of a music\ntitle is in the references, whereas another version of the same\ntitle is broadcast. This typically happens when an artist is\ninvited on a radio show and performs some of his titles live.\nIn this case, even if the studio versions of the artist‚Äôs titles\nare in the references, the algorithm is not required to match\nthe studio version with the live performance. Indeed, the\nrecognition of different interpretations of the same song is\nconsidered to be out of the scope of this work.\n12412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4.2.3 Parameters\nWe have used 5s long analysis frames with a 50% over-\nlap. The post-processing parameters have been set to P=\n12andTvote= 6. This means that the detection is per-\nformed on 30s of signal, and requires that at least half of the\nmatching during these 30s has given a coherent identiÔ¨Åca-\ntion. Such parameters insure a very low rate of false alarms,\nwhich is required in many use-cases for audio-Ô¨Ångerprint.\n4.2.4 Results\nAlgorithm Detected occ. / Total nb False Alarms\nWang [2] 381 / 459 (=83.0%) 0\nI B&S [10] 445 / 459 (=96.9%) 2\nSAF (proposed) 447 / 459 (=97.4%) 0\nTable 1 : Results of the comparative experiment\nWe can see in Table 1 that the detection ratio is much\nhigher with our Ô¨Ångerprint than the original model of Wang.\nAs far as we can tell, this really comes from the fact that a\nnon-negligible number of broadcast songs are pitch-shifted.\nThese results therefore show that, in addition to being robust\nto the same distortions as Wang‚Äôs model, our Ô¨Ångerprint has\nan increased robustness to pitch-shifting. Besides, we can\nsee that the post-processing plays its role very efÔ¨Åciently. It\nhas prevented all the false alarms (in both algorithms Wang\nand SAF) and still has allowed a very high detection rate.\n4.2.5 Runtime\nWe will give here some Ô¨Ågures about the processing times\nof the algorithms. These Ô¨Ågures are given on the basis of\nour MatlabR/circlecopyrt64-bits implementations, running on an IntelR/circlecopyrt\nCore 2 Duo @ 3,16 GHz with 6MB of Cache and 8GB of\nRAM. We are aware that these Ô¨Ågures give no absolute truth,\nsince the processing times highly depend on the machines,\nthe programming language and the optimization of the code.\nThey nevertheless give an order of magnitude of the run-\ntimes with such a conÔ¨Åguration. Besides, they allow a com-\nparison of the different algorithms since all running times\nare given on the same basis.\nThe algorithm ‚ÄúWang‚Äù has a processing time of 0.08s per\nsecond of signal. The algorithm ‚ÄúSAF‚Äù has a processing\ntime of 0.43 seconds per second of signal. The difference\nmainly comes from the extra time required for the calcula-\ntion of the constant Q transform. If we apply the pruning\ntechnique described in section 3.6 with Tprune = 0.5, we\nobtain a speed-up factor of 35%. This reduces the process-\ning time of the second algorithm to 0.28 seconds per second\nof signal with the exact same identiÔ¨Åcation score.4.3 Scaling experiment\n4.3.1 Objectives\nWe have led a second experiment in order to validate the po-\ntential scalability of the system we propose. The framework\nis the same as in the previous experiment, but we now run\nthe algorithm with a much larger references database.\n4.3.2 Data\nIn this experiment the stream is made of 5 days of radio\nbroadcast coming from 2 different French radio stations (RTL,\nVirgin Radio). The references set is much larger as it con-\ntains 30.000 songs.\n4.3.3 Results\nAlgorithm Detected occ. / Total nb. False Alarms\nSAF (proposed) 496 / 506 (=98.0%) 0\nTable 2 : Results of the scaling experiment\n(30.000 songs)\nThe results clearly show that the algorithm is scalable.\nIt has achieved a detection performance which is compara-\nble to its performance in the Ô¨Årst experiment. Though, the\nreferences database is more than 4 times larger in this ex-\nperiment. It is particularly noticeable that in spite of the\nenlargement of the database, the system has still not out-\nput any false alarm. The multiplication of the songs in the\ndatabase had yet highly increased the risk of having close\nÔ¨Ångerprints for different songs.\nAs far as the detection performance is concerned, the re-\nsults of this experiment show that the algorithm we propose\nhas the ability to handle industrial sized databases.\n4.3.4 Runtime\nThe basis for the following calculation time is the same as in\nsection 4.3.4. With the 30.000 songs database, the algorithm\n(without pruning) runs at a speed of 1.44 seconds per sec-\nond of signal. If we compare this running time with the one\nof the smaller scale experiment, we notice that the multipli-\ncation of the database size by 4 has lead to a multiplication\nof the processing time by 3,3. The increase of the running\ntime is thus sub-linear with the number of references. We\ncan also note that, even though the code has not been fully\noptimized, the algorithm almost runs in real-time.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we have proposed a new Ô¨Ångerprint model.\nWe have included this Ô¨Ångerprint in a global architecture.\n125Poster Session 1\nThe overall system is able to process audio streams in accor-\ndance with a radio monitoring use-case. The Ô¨Ångerprint we\npropose is inspired by Wang‚Äôs work [2] from which we have\nreproduced the indexing scheme based on pairs of spectral\npeaks. But our use of the constant Q transform and our\nproposition of a different encoding for pairs of peaks allows\nus to show a much increased robustness to pitch-shifting.\nThis, in turn, greatly improves our identiÔ¨Åcation results on\nreal radio broadcasts, as it has been shown in the compar-\native experiment presented. As far as scalability is con-\ncerned, we presented a second experiment which is based\non a 30.000 songs database. This proved that our system\neasily scales up, while keeping a high detection ratio and a\nreasonable calculation time. In the future, we will focus on\nthe problem brought up in section 4.2.2. The annotations\nwe used indeed contain an average 7% of live versions of\ntitles stored in the references database in their studio ver-\nsions. Matching the ones with the others is a problem that\nlies somewhere between audio Ô¨Ångerprint and cover song\ndetection.

INTRODUCTION\nOur goal is to devise methods for predicting music in a\ncausal setting. Given a stream of observed music feature\nvectors extracted from an audio signal, we seek to predict\nfuture values of feature vectors. Furthermore, we seek to\nincorporate domain knowledge about the underlying music\nsignal into the prediction process: Across musical genres,\nmusic exhibits hierarchical temporal structure, arising cen-\ntrally from the identity relations between structural elements\n[11]. In Western music, elementary events are typically\nrhythmic, melodic or harmonic and give rise to long-term\nstructure characteristic of a piece‚Äôs musical form, through\napplication of variation and repetition. Conversely, identify-\ning parallelism in music ‚Äî the occurrence of variation and\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.repetition ‚Äî is agreed to bear great importance in music-\ntheoretical analysis [2].\nThis view may be considered to encompass cognitive pro-\ncesses involved in music listening. Here, music consists of\na stream of events unfolding in time and experienced by a\nlistener [9]. The listening process is associated with predic-\ntions of future events, which depend on the listener‚Äôs evolv-\ning internal model of musical structure generated by previ-\nously observed events in the stream of music. This work\nis based on this causal prediction setting, where at a given\npoint in time only events in the past inform predictions.\nAccurate prediction of spectro-temporal features, such\nas Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs), chroma or\nrhythmograms [15], is motivated by a number of applica-\ntions. Firstly, audio visualisation tasks might beneÔ¨Åt from\nprediction, since live performance environments typically\nconstrain the permissible amount of latency introduced in\nthe audio processing chain [6]. Similarly, it is of interest to\ninvestigate robust real-time audio streaming applications for\nlive music performance [10]. In the latter case, employing\nprediction techniques might allow the effect of network la-\ntency to be offset. Further applications of audio based pre-\ndiction are automated musical accompaniment [8, 20] and\naudio feature models for automated music transcription.\nIn addition, prediction accuracy can be related to the as-\nsumed model of the underlying distribution of observations.\nIn terms of inductive inference [19], accurate prediction re-\nlates to effective data compression of observations. This re-\nlationship might be exploited in online music content analy-\nsis applications. Existing work has examined the problem of\nofÔ¨Çine music content analysis, where compressibility is used\nto evaluate structural similarity between pieces of music [1].\nA related application is information-dynamic modelling of\nmusical audio [4].\nIn this work, we evaluate several prediction methods, in-\ncluding autoregressive models, N-gram models, and a novel\ntechnique based on utilising the long-term structure of mu-\nsic signals. In addition, we propose a method for combining\npredictors by estimating predictors‚Äô error variance. We con-\nsider chroma and MFCC features, which describe harmonic\nand timbral information in musical audio signals [15]. Re-\n501Poster Session 4\nsults indicate that combining the self-distance approach with\nautoregressive or N-gram models substantially improves the\naccuracy of predicting continuous-valued music features.\n1.1 Causal music feature prediction\nSuppose we have a sequence of vectors v1, . . . ,vT, corre-\nsponding to Tfeature observations made at times œÑ1, . . . , œÑ T.\nEach vector occupies k-dimensional feature space, v‚ààRk,\naccording to an unknown probability distribution. Causal\nprediction involves approximating the unknown conditional\nprobability distribution p(vt|v1, . . . ,vt‚àí1). The predicted\nfeature at time œÑtis then obtained by computing the expecta-\ntionE[vt|v1, . . . ,vt‚àí1]. The prediction task is causal, since\nobservations v1, . . . ,vt‚àí1inform predictions vt. Succes-\nsive predictions are formed by increasing t, so that the ob-\nservation history accumulates over time.\nCausal predictive models have been applied to music in\nsymbolic formats [16]. In the audio domain, the concern of\nour presented work, [8] proposes an approach for prediction\ndriven musical expectation modelling. In [3] prediction is\nexamined in the context of planning, as a means of creating\nanticipatory music systems. In [20] a method is proposed\nfor automatic harmonic accompaniment based on repetition\ndetection.\n2. PREDICTION TECHNIQUES\nWe investigate prediction techniques for beat-synchronous\nchroma and MFCC features, as described in the following.\n2.1 Autoregressive models\nIn a multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model [12], pre-\ndicted feature vectors vtare computed as linear combina-\ntions of Npreceding feature vectors‚Äô components. Correla-\ntion between separate components is taken into account, so\nthat\nvt=N/summationdisplay\nn=1Anvt‚àín+rt (1)\nwhere matrices Anincorporate information on correlations\nbetween between components of vt‚àínandvt. Vector rt\nis an independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise\nterm.\nLet us use vt,uto denote the uth component of vector\nvt. A special case of the MAR model arises when indepen-\ndence between feature components is assumed. In that case,\nmatrices Anare diagonal, so that\nvt,u=N/summationdisplay\nn=1an,uvt‚àín,u+rt,u (2)\nwith 1‚â§u‚â§k. CoefÔ¨Åcients rt,uare described by kuni-\nvariate Gaussian noise processes with Ô¨Ånite mean and vari-ance. The model in Equation 2 is equivalent to a component-\nwise linear predictive coding (LPC) model, with each LPC\nmodel deÔ¨Åned by index u.\n2.2 N-gram prediction\nN-gram models have been used to model symbolic music\n[16]. In this model, observations are quantised. Let etde-\nnote a quantised observation symbol. Symbols are members\nof a speciÔ¨Åed alphabet A. For convenience, we use et‚àí1\nt‚àín\nto denote the sequence of symbols et‚àín, et‚àín+1, . . . , e t‚àí1.\nThe conditional probability of predicted event et, given the\nhistory of observations is assumed to obey the Markov prop-\nerty. That is, p(et|et‚àí1\n1) =p(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín), where nis the or-\nder of the Markov model. An estimator for this conditional\nprobability is\np(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) =c(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín)/summationtext\ne‚ààAc(e|et‚àí1\nt‚àín)(3)\nwhere c(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín)denotes the number of times symbol et\nhas been observed following context et‚àí1\nt‚àín, computed over\nthe entire observation sequence et‚àí1\n1. To estimate the prob-\nability of unobserved events, we incorporate a smoothing\napproach [14], so that recursively,\np(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) =/braceleftBigg\nŒ±(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) forc(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín)>0\nŒ≥(et‚àí1\nt‚àín)p(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín+1)otherwise.\n(4)\nIn Equation 4, Œ±(¬∑|¬∑)is deÔ¨Åned as follows. It is used as\nlong as the sequence et\nt‚àínhas previously been observed at\nleast once. Alternatively, the conditional probability is re-\ncursively evaluated using a function Œ≥(¬∑)and a lower order\nestimation p(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín+1).\nAs employed in [8], Œ±(¬∑|¬∑)andŒ≥(¬∑)are deÔ¨Åned as\nŒ≥(et‚àí1\nt‚àín) =d(et‚àí1\nt‚àín)/summationtext\ne‚ààAc(e|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) +d(et‚àí1\nt‚àín)(5)\nŒ±(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) =c(et|et‚àí1\nt‚àín)/summationtext\ne‚ààAc(e|et‚àí1\nt‚àín) +d(et‚àí1\nt‚àín)(6)\nwhere d(et‚àí1\nt‚àín)denotes the number of distinct symbols ob-\nserved as continuations of context et‚àí1\nt‚àín. Intuitively, as d(¬∑)\nincreases, more emphasis is placed on shorter contexts when\nestimating unobserved symbol probabilities.\nSince the N-gram model is based on an alphabet of dis-\ncrete symbols, we quantise our continuous-valued feature\nvectors prior to learning this model. This is achieved using\nonline k-means clustering, described in Section 3.2.\n2.3 Repetition detection\nWe propose the use of a repetition detection algorithm to in-\nform predictions in conjunction with autoregressive and N-\ngram approaches. To incorporate information on long-term\n50212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nstructure as described in Section 1, the similarity between\nfeature vector sequences is computed during the prediction\nprocess. As incorporated in [20], the approach uses a self-\ndistance matrix (SDM). Given observations v1, . . . ,vt‚àí1,\nthe SDM Dis deÔ¨Åned as [D]i,j=d(vi,vj), with 1‚â§i, j <\nt. As proposed in [7], for the distance function d(¬∑,¬∑)we use\nthe cosine distance,\nd(vi,vj) = 0 .5/parenleftbigg\n1‚àívi¬∑vj\n/bardblvi/bardbl /bardblvj/bardbl/parenrightbigg\n. (7)\nAssume a predeÔ¨Åned sequence comparison length L. We\nuse the SDM to consider all alignments between past se-\nquences vs‚àíL, . . . ,vs‚àí1and the most recently observed fea-\nture vectors vt‚àíL, . . . ,vt‚àí1, with L < s < t . Comparing\nvector-wise with the most recently observed feature vectors,\nthe past sequence with minimal average distance is selected\nas the conjectured repeated sequence. This sequence is used\nfor prediction, assuming that vt‚âàvs. With L < t ‚â§T,\nthetth prediction wtis obtained using index pof past vector\nvp, with\np= argmin\nL <s <t{d¬µ(s, t)}, (8)\nwhere d¬µ(s, t)denotes the average distance between two\nsubsequences of length L,\nd¬µ(s, t) =1\nLL/summationdisplay\n/lscript=1[D]s‚àí/lscript,t‚àí/lscript. (9)\nComputing the entire sequence of predictions has poly-\nnomial time complexity against the total sequence length T,\nsince each prediction at step trequires O(T)operations. We\nobserve that using beat-synchronous features results in an\naverage sequence length of approximately 650, for the data\nset of popular music chosen for evaluation. Therefore scal-\nability is not thought to restrict the algorithm‚Äôs utility, for\nmusic signals with similar duration to those in the data set.\nFurthermore, it is possible to deal with longer music sig-\nnals by imposing a maximum size on the SDM, discarding\nobservations which fall outside a speciÔ¨Åed history limit.\n2.4 Combining multiple predictors\nTo combine the predictions generated by the SDM and N-\ngram approaches, we propose a linear weighting scheme\nbased on estimated variance of error1. For a set of Mpre-\ndictors, deÔ¨Åne the tth prediction by each predictor vi\nt, with\n1‚â§i‚â§M. DeÔ¨Åne the true value of the tth vector to be v‚àó\nt.\nWe assume an observation model where predictions vi\ntare\nthe sum of observations v‚àó\ntand an error term /epsilon1i\nt,\nvi\nt,u=v‚àó\nt,u+/epsilon1i\nt,u (10)\nwhere indices udenote vector components, with 1‚â§u‚â§k.\nWe assume components /epsilon1i\nt,uto be normally distributed, with\n1The method is similar in spirit to aggregation methods reviewed in\n[21].variance œÉ2\ni,u. Using Hpredictions as samples, the variance\nof the error œÉ2\ni,ucan be estimated as\nÀÜœÉ2\ni,u=1\nH‚àí1H/summationdisplay\nh=1/parenleftbig\nvi\nt‚àíh,u‚àív‚àó\nt‚àíh,u/parenrightbig2. (11)\nBecause the error is assumed to be normal, we have p(vi\nt,u|v‚àó\nt,u) =\nN(v‚àó\nt,u, œÉ2\ni,u). Using Bayes‚Äô theorem, we have\np(v‚àó\nt,u|vi\nt,u) =p(vi\nt,u|v‚àó\nt,u)p(v‚àó\nt,u)\np(vi\nt,u). (12)\nIf we assume the ratio of p(vi\nt,u)andp(v‚àó\nt,u)is non-\ninformative, we then have p(vi\nt,u|v‚àó\nt,u) =p(v‚àó\nt,u|vi\nt,u). We\nfurther assume independence between predictors and denote\nŒ≤i,u= 1/œÉ2\ni,ufor notational convenience. Then, the distri-\nbution of v‚àó\nt,ucan be expressed as\np(v‚àó\nt,u|v1\nt,u, . . . , vM\nt,u) =M/productdisplay\ni=1N/parenleftbigg\nv‚àó\nt,u;vi\nt,u,1\nŒ≤i,u/parenrightbigg\n=N/parenleftBigg\nv‚àó\nt,u;/summationtextM\ni=1Œ≤i,u/summationtextM\nj=1Œ≤j,u,1/summationtextM\ni=1Œ≤i,u/parenrightBigg\n.\n(13)\nGiven all predictions, the expected value of v‚àó\nt,u,E[v‚àó\nt,u]is\nthen the weighted sum\nE/bracketleftbig\nv‚àó\nt,u/bracketrightbig\n=/summationtextM\ni=1Œ≤i,uvi\nt,u/summationtextM\nj=1Œ≤j,u. (14)\nEquation 14 describes the weighting scheme used to com-\nbine multiple predictions. Note that values Œ≤i,udescribe the\nprecision of prediction method i, estimated over prediction\nhistory of length H.\n3. METHOD\nThe data set used for evaluation consists of 180 mono audio\ntracks of songs by The Beatles, with each track sampled at\n44.1kHz [13].\n3.1 Feature extraction\nWe extract beat-synchronous chroma features using the ap-\nproach and implementation described in [5]. These chroma\nfeatures are based on the mapping of FFT bins to twelve\npitch class components, using phase derivatives to reduce\nthe inÔ¨Çuence of non-tonal components present in the spec-\ntrum. Chroma frames are based on an FFT window size\nof 2048 with 75% overlap. This approach compensates for\nmistuning by computing the optimal alignment between fre-\nquency peaks and chroma bins over the entire signal.\nFurthermore, we extract beat-synchronous MFCCs, us-\ning the approach and implementation described in [18]. The\nMFCCs are based on an FFT window size of 512 with 50%\n503Poster Session 4\noverlap. The Ô¨Ålter bank consists of 13 linearly spaced Ô¨Ål-\nters and 27 log spaced Ô¨Ålters. We extract the 12 Ô¨Årst cepstal\ncoefÔ¨Åcients, omitting the d.c. coefÔ¨Åcient. Beat-synchronous\nMFCCs are then obtained by computing mean feature val-\nues within each beat onset interval, applying the same onset\nintervals used for chroma feature extraction.\nThe beat onset times are estimated using the code and\napproach described in [5]. In terms of the causal predic-\ntion problem which this work addresses, we note that the\nmethod‚Äôs application of dynamic programming is non-causal.\nIn this work, we treat the beat tracking routines as an oracle\nfor obtaining beat onset times.\n3.2 Online clustering\nTo obtain discrete symbols for the N-gram predictor, we\nquantise observed feature vectors using online k-means clus-\ntering. As described in [8], an initial codebook of Kcen-\ntroids ¬µ1, . . . , ¬µ Kis constructed according to the Ô¨Årst Qob-\nserved symbols. Thereafter, upon observing feature v‚àó\nt, the\nclosest centroid\n¬µt= argmin\n1‚â§k‚â§K/braceleftbig\n/bardblv‚àó\nt‚àí¬µk/bardbl2/bracerightbig\n(15)\nis updated according to\n¬µt:=¬µt+Œ∑(v‚àó\nt‚àí¬µk). (16)\nIn our evaluation, we set Q=K. A hold-out set of 60 ran-\ndom songs is formed. A learning factor of Œ∑= 0.4is deter-\nmined, based on MFCC and chroma prediction performance\nand using the described data set with a Ô¨Åxed codebook size\nofK= 64 . For Ô¨Åxed Œ∑= 0.1, alternative strategies for\ncodebook construction were evaluated, involving initialisa-\ntion to held out data. However, these revealed no compelling\nimprovement over the aforementioned method, in terms of\nN-gram prediction performance.\nFor the N-gram predictor, prediction proceeds causally,\nso that after the tth prediction, N-gram probabilities are up-\ndated to include the actually observed symbol e‚àó\ntand its con-\ntextet‚àí1\nt‚àín. The N-gram predictor is learned using only ob-\nservations from the target song. Given the average length of\n650 symbols per song, we estimate the required codebook\nsize to be in the order of‚àö\n650‚âà25symbols. Consider-\ning that the N-gram model incorporates a smoothing scheme\n(cf. Equation 4), we set the Markov order to constant n= 5,\nobserving similar prediction performance for n= 2. Using\nthe held-out data set of 60 songs, we set respective SDM\nprediction lengths L= 22 ,L= 36 , which maximise pre-\ndiction performance for chroma and MFCCs.\n3.3 Performance statistics\nThe statistics used for evaluation are the sum of squares er-\nror (SSE), the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and the\nabsolute deviation (AD). The SSE for the tth prediction iscomputed as\nSSE(vt,v‚àó\nt) =/bardblvt‚àív‚àó\nt/bardbl2. (17)\nThe JSD is a symmetrised version of the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence. It is computed as\nJSD(vt/bardblv‚àó\nt) =1\n2KL(vt, F) +1\n2KL(v‚àó\nt, F)(18)\nwhere KL(¬∑/bardbl¬∑)denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence and\nFis deÔ¨Åned as\nF=1\n2(vt+v‚àó\nt). (19)\nFinally, the absolute deviation is computed as\nAD(vt,v‚àó\nt) =/bardblvt‚àív‚àó\nt/bardbl1 (20)\nwhere /bardbl ¬∑ /bardbl1denotes the /lscript1-norm.\nWe compute the statistics for all predictions and average\nover predictions in the entire data set. For example, the av-\nerage sum of squares error SSE ¬µis computed as\nSSE ¬µ=1\nTT/summationdisplay\nt=1SSE(vt,v‚àó\nt). (21)\nAverage prediction results therefore describe vector-wise pre-\ndiction error and do not account for variability in song du-\nration. We compute 99% conÔ¨Ådence intervals on average\nperformance data. Relative to LPC prediction performance,\nconÔ¨Ådence intervals do not exceed 3.4%,1.8%,0.2%, in\nterms of average SSE, JSD and AD, respectively.\n4. RESULTS\nWe evaluate autoregressive, N-gram and SDM predictors.\nDesignating the LPC predictor as a baseline, Figure1 illus-\ntrates prediction performance relative to the LPC baseline,\nin terms of average SSE, JSD, AD. Performance values are\nexpressed as the quotient S/B, where Sis the average pre-\ndiction error of the sample and Bis the average prediction\nerror of the LPC baseline.\n4.1 Single predictor performance\nWe Ô¨Årst consider the accuracy of individual predictors, with\nno method of combining them applied. On the left hand\nside of Figure 1 (a), (b), we include results for four predic-\ntion techniques. Based on the assumption of local station-\narity, the predictor termed ‚ÄòCopy‚Äô estimates the tth predic-\ntion as vc\nt=v‚àó\nt‚àí1. The predictor termed ‚ÄòLPC‚Äô applies\nthe linear predictor described in Equation 2. The predic-\ntor termed ‚ÄòMAR‚Äô performs multivariate autoregression ac-\ncording to Equation 1. The predictor termed ‚ÄòSDM‚Äô corre-\nsponds to repetition detection using a self-distance matrix,\nas described in Section 2.3. For both LPC and MAR pre-\ndictors, all observations v‚àó\n1, . . . ,v‚àó\nt‚àí1are incorporated into\n50412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\na least-squares regression [12]. Results are reported for sec-\nond order LPC models (chroma), third order LPC models\n(MFCC) and Ô¨Årst order MAR models (chroma and MFCC),\nwith orders selected to maximise held-out data performance.\nConsidering chroma feature prediction in Figure 1 (a),\nwe observe that Copy prediction is signiÔ¨Åcantly outperformed\nby all remaining predictors, for all evaluated statistics. Ob-\nserving that the MAR model is outperformed by LPC based\nprediction, it appears that for the given sequence lengths and\nthe chosen features, it is preferable to assume independence\nbetween feature components.\nFor the considered codebook sizes, the N-gram model is\nalmost consistently outperformed by the LPC predictor. To\nreduce the error that is due to quantisation alone, we weight\npredicted feature vectors using the linear combination (1‚àí\nŒ≥)vn+Œ≥vc, where vnis the discrete N-gram prediction.\nParameter Œ≥is varied within the unit interval, in steps of\n0.1. Based on 10 √ó2 cross-validation on the remaining 120\nsongs, results are reported for Œ≥= 0.4, which maximises\nSSE performance for both chroma and MFCC features. In\nFigure 1, this predictor is termed ‚ÄòWeighted‚Äô.\nConsidering MFCC feature prediction in Figure 1 (b),\nwe observe that SDM prediction offers less advantage over\nCopy prediction, compared to chroma prediction.\nTurning to the effect of increasing codebook size, we\nobserve that SSE performance improves for chroma pre-\ndictions. Surprisingly, for MFCC prediction increasing the\ncodebook size adversely affects SSE performance. In both\ncases, JSD and AD performance degrades when increasing\ncodebook size.\n4.2 Combined predictor performance\nResults for combinations of predictors are shown on the\nright hand side of Figure 1 (a), (b). To restrict the param-\neter space, the evaluation is based on the aforementioned\nbaseline results. Thus, the linear chroma weighting factor is\nset to Œ≥= 0.4.

Average chroma prediction perfor-\nmance improves by at least 14%. Furthermore, combin-\ning N-gram and SDM predictors yields minor improvement\nover the analogous LPC and SDM combination.\n5. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK\nIn this work, we have considered the problem of causal mu-\nsic prediction using MFCC and chroma features. We have\ncomparatively evaluated the performance of predictors for\nseries of continuous-valued and quantised feature vectors.\nWe have considered how musical parallelism might be har-\nnessed for causal prediction of spectro-temporal features.\nThe prediction approach proposed in this work is based on\nrepetition detection using a self-distance matrix.\nFor the evaluated statistics, combining the SDM predic-\ntor with LPC or N-gram approaches allows substantial im-\nprovements in prediction accuracy to be made, compared\nto the baseline. This suggests that incorporating informa-\ntion on long-term musical structure might have utility for\nthe causal prediction of spectro-temporal features.\nConsidering the obtained results, we plan investigations\nto determine the effectiveness of online quantisation, the\nprerequisite for applying discrete-event models such as the\nN-gram model used in this work. Furthermore, we aim\nto perform an evaluation of hierarchical language models\nbased on the N-gram model used in this work. Finally, we\naim to consider music prediction from a perceptual perspec-\ntive, to identify correlates between perceived musical simi-\nlarity and prediction accuracy.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nAutomatic classiÔ¨Åcation of audio signals is one of the main\nresearch areas in the Ô¨Åeld of music information retrieval.\nThis task consists in assigning audio signals to one or more\ncategories (classes), according to a chosen criterion, which\ncan be the musical instrument played, the speaker gender,\nthe corresponding musical genre, etc. ClassiÔ¨Åcation can\nbe very useful for many applications scenarios, such as\ndatabase annotation, stream segmentation, and smart orga-\nnization and search of large libraries.\nMost audio classiÔ¨Åcation systems represent the signal by\nsplitting it into Ô¨Åxed-duration frames, from which several\nThis work was realized as part of the Quaero Programme, funded by\nOSEO, French State agency for innovation\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.features are computed to be used by a learner. Given such\ntraining examples, the learner will then build a rule for deter-\nmining the relevant class of any previously unseen example,\nonly by considering its features. However, using frames of\nthe same length limits the duration of the observable phe-\nnomena. While describing signal characteristics at different\nscales has become frequent in image processing [15], few\naudio-related studies use several temporal horizons for de-\nscribing the signal.\nThe purpose of the present work is to setup a classiÔ¨Å-\ncation scheme that leverages the discrimination power of\nthe features considered, by extracting them at different time\nscales and using a boosting technique to combine them efÔ¨Å-\nciently. To precisely demonstrate the advantage brought by\nthe use of different scales, we keep the same representation\nat every scale ( i.e.compute the same features at different\nscales), but our system is Ô¨Çexible enough to handle different\ntypes of descriptions through varying scales.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we Ô¨Årst brieÔ¨Çy review au-\ndio classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms and related temporal integra-\ntion techniques in Section 2. Then we describe our multi-\nscale classiÔ¨Åcation method (Section 3), and in Section 4, we\npresent our experiments and results.\n2. RELATED WORK\nAudio classiÔ¨Åcation makes use of machine learning to build\nrules for predicting the relevant class of a previously un-\nknown audio excerpt. A good overview of the music clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation problems and most common techniques can be\nfound in [5].\nFirst, the signal is described by a set of features. Among\nthe most common, we can name: Fourier transform coefÔ¨Å-\ncients, mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC), delta-\nMFCC, chromagrams or zero-crossing rates [17]. Most of\nthe time, several features are computed from a single frame,\nthen they are concatenated into one high-dimensional fea-\nture vector.\nIn order to map the obtained description to class labels,\n663Poster Session 6\nvarious classiÔ¨Åers have been considered in previous works.\nThe two most used ones are probably Gaussian mixture\nmodels (GMM) [16] and Support vector machines (SVM)\n[11]. Alternatively, several recent works have made use of\nboosting, a meta-classiÔ¨Åer training several complementary\nversions of other learners [3, 4].\nMost systems choose to represent the signal using Ô¨Åxed-\nlength frames. However, the concepts behind each class\nmay be conveyed by signal properties that have heteroge-\nneous temporal dynamics. Therefore, potentially useful de-\nscriptors may need to be built at various time scales. Hence,\na problem occurs when one tries to fuse such descriptions,\nbecause simple concatenation of the features (as done in\nmost works) is infeasible.\nEarly integration [9] can be used to solve this problem,\nsimply by integrating the features computed over shorter\nframes, over the duration of the longest analysis window.\nThis synchronization of all descriptors allows for their con-\ncatenation, but the temporal precision of the shorter-term\nfeatures is reduced. Therefore, potentially useful high-\nfrequency content lost due to the integration low-pass Ô¨Ål-\ntering effect.\nIn [2], the authors fuse MFCC, along with chroma, web\ndocuments analysis and Last.fm tags1, by means of kernel\nfusion. The boosting algorithm can also be used for classi-\nÔ¨Åer fusion [18]. In [1], fusion by boosting is applied to audio\ndata, but all representations are done at the same scale: one\nvector per song. We can also cite [12], where the authors\ndiscriminate speech/nonspeech segments with features built\nusing a constant-Q Ô¨Ålterbank. In this kind of transform, the\nÔ¨Ålters do not usually have the same temporal support. How-\never, once the feature vector is built, no information is kept\nabout the temporal support.\nFurthermore, studies pointed out that representing the\nsignal on different scales, and jointly considering all scales\nduring the whole learning process, may lead to a more com-\nplete analysis of the signal than using a single temporal hori-\nzon [14]. Indeed, short-term features can precisely capture\nshort events and quick changes in the signal. On the other\nhand, long-term features are able to represent larger phe-\nnomena, but with a poor temporal resolution. Using features\nbuilt over several scales should then allow for describing\njointly more diverse aspects of the signal.\n3. PROPOSED METHOD\nWe propose a novel boosting scheme to achieve multi-scale\ninformation fusion at a decision level. The boosting al-\ngorithm trains a weak classiÔ¨Åer several times, putting the\nemphasis on different examples among iterations. As men-\n1Last.fm is an online music listening service, where any user can asso-\nciate any tag to a song. These tags can be automatically retrieved through\nan API.tioned in Section 2, boosting has already been adapted for\nclassiÔ¨Åer fusion. This fusion can be achieved by simply con-\nsidering several weak classiÔ¨Åers in parallel, and selecting,\nat each iteration, the best performing one. This constitutes\na convenient framework for heterogeneous classiÔ¨Åer fusion\nbecause it does not make any assumption on the nature of\nthe weak classiÔ¨Åers. It considers only their decisions on the\ntraining examples.\n3.1 Multi-scale representation\nIn this work, we evaluate the merit of a multi-scale feature\nrepresentation compared to the classical mono-scale repre-\nsentation. In order to clearly identify the usefulness of the\nmulti-scale approach compared to the mono-scale one, the\nsame set of features is used at every scale. Further details\non the features used are given in Section 4.\nThe multi-scale feature representation is built as follows.\nFirst, the sequence of descriptors is computed at the Ô¨Åner\nscale, and then the other ones are obtained by temporal in-\ntegration, which allows for fast feature computation. We\nintegrate feature vectors by temporal averaging.\n3.2 Boosting trees\nFor every scale s, our weak learner Hsis a CART2classi-\nÔ¨Åcation tree [7] using Ls-sample length frames. Trees are\nconvenient, as they can be trained fast, and have proven ef-\nÔ¨Åcient when boosted [3]. Furthermore, they present the ad-\nvantage of performing feature selection during their train-\ning.\nDecision trees are built from a root containing all training\nexamples. At each node, the data is split in two (or possibly\nmore) children nodes, only using a threshold on a particular\nbin of the feature vector. The bin and threshold values are\nchosen so that the two children nodes are the ‚Äúpurest‚Äù pos-\nsible ( i.e.the probabilities of the two classes are the furthest\npossible from 0.5). Here, we use binary trees, with the Gini\nimpurity measure. The depth is Ô¨Åxed in advance, and we\nseparately experiment depths 1 (which is also referred to as\na stump) and 2.\n3.3 Decision ranges\nAt each boosting iteration, the boosting algorithm chooses\nthe weak classiÔ¨Åer with the lowest weighted error rate. Mak-\ning a fair comparison between the classiÔ¨Åers implies that the\ndecisions, for each of them, must be taken on the same au-\ndio segments. Because the frames of the different classiÔ¨Åers\ndo not describe the same portions of signal, we have to set\nthe length on which the decisions are taken, for all scales.\nFor this purpose we introduce decision ranges . These\nranges represent the portions of signal on which the deci-\nsions of the weak classiÔ¨Åers are taken. Figure 1 shows how\n2ClassiÔ¨Åcation And Regression Tree.\n66412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\na decision range i, in gray, includes the feature frames from\nthe different scales. Each xn\ni,sis a description vector, where\nsis the temporal scale level, nis the index of the frame\nwithin the decision range, and irepresents the surrounding\ndecision frame. We consider a frame to belong to range i\nif its center is included in the temporal bounds of i. In the\nfollowing, we will denote by xithe set of all frames from\nall scales, that belong to range i.\nTimeFeature scale s\n...\n...\n...\n...Decision range i\nx1\ni,S\nx1\ni,1 xN1\ni,1...xn\ni,s\nFigure 1 . A decision range (in gray), covering a different\nnumber of frames on different scales.\nFigure 1 also shows that a decision range cannot be\nshorter than the frames at the largest scale. Otherwise,\nthe largest scale could be favored because it uses a greater\namount of signal. On the contrary, decision ranges longer\nthanLmaxwould decrease the number of training examples.\nThis is why each range spans exactly Lmaxsamples.\n3.4 Core algorithm\nThe whole learning procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1.\nWe start from the examples xn\ni,s, with class labels yi. The\nlabels neither depend on snorn, but only on the current\nsong which comprises segment i, as we are assuming class\nlabels always span the whole song duration. Thus, although\nÔ¨Ånal decisions may be taken at a song-level, they are ob-\ntained by combining intermediate decisions taken on seg-\nments of a song, referred to as decision ranges , based on a\ncorresponding set of feature-vector instances xn\ni,s.\nEach of these decision ranges gets an associated weight,\nrepresenting the relative focus of the algorithm during the\ncurrent iteration. In the beginning, all weights are equal for\nranges belonging to the same class.\nAt each iteration r, the weights wr,iare normalized so\nthey sum to 1, before the weak classiÔ¨Åers hr,s(the CART\ntrees) are trained. These trainings must take into account\nthe weights of the examples. For each scale, the decision on\nrangeiis a majority vote on all frames belonging to i. Us-\ning these decisions, we can compute an error rate for every\nscale. The scale ÀÜsrwith the lowest error rate is then selected\nfor the Ô¨Ånal strong decision, with weight Œ±r. After that, theAlgorithm 1 Adaboost for multi-scale classiÔ¨Åer fusion.\nInput: Annotated examples from all scales (xn\ni,s,yi),\n1‚â§i‚â§I,1‚â§s‚â§S, 1‚â§n‚â§Ns\nInput: Weak learnersHs\nw1,i‚Üê‚àí1\n2m,1\n2l, resp. foryi= 0,1, wheremandl\nare the number of negative and positive examples, respec-\ntively\nforr= 1,...,R do\nwr,i‚Üê‚àíwr,iPI\nj=1wr,j// Normalize the weights\nTrain classiÔ¨Åers hr,swith the modelsHsand weights\nwr,i\n// Decisions of hr,son the observation ranges i\ndr,s,i=/braceleftbigg\n1 if1\nNs/summationtextNs\nn=1hr,s(xn\ni,s)>0.5\n0 otherwise,\n// Compute weighted error rate\n/epsilon1r,s‚Üê‚àí/summationtext\niwr,i|dr,s,i‚àíyi|\n// Best scale\nÀÜsr‚Üê‚àíargmins/epsilon1r,s\n/epsilon1r‚Üê‚àí/epsilon1r,ÀÜsr\nhr‚Üê‚àí/summationtext\nnhr,ÀÜsr\n// CoefÔ¨Åcient associated with hr\nŒ±r‚Üê‚àílog1\nŒ≤r, whereŒ≤r=/epsilon1r\n1‚àí/epsilon1r,\n// Update the example weights\nfor all rangesido\n// test whether dr,ÀÜsr,i=yi\nifxiwell classiÔ¨Åed then\nwr+1,i‚Üê‚àíwr,iŒ≤r\nelse\nwr+1,i‚Üê‚àíwr,i\nend if\nend for\nend for\nOutput:H(x) =/summationtext\nrŒ±rhr(x)\n665Poster Session 6\nweights of the correctly classiÔ¨Åed examples are decreased,\nthus reducing their importance for future iterations.\nThe Ô¨Ånal output H(x)is used during the testing phase as\nfollows.

Then,H(xi)is a weighted sum\nof thehr(xi), as stated at the end of Algorithm 1. Finally,\nthe global decision for a whole song ais a standard late\nintegration over all decision ranges within a.

EXPERIMENTS\nTo show the usefulness of our multi-scale system compared\nto mono-scale systems, we perform experiments on two\ndatasets, corresponding to two usual tasks is audio classi-\nÔ¨Åcation. We Ô¨Årst validate our method on a musical instru-\nment recognition database. Then, we test our system perfor-\nmance for multi-tag classiÔ¨Åcation on the now well-known\nCAL500 [16]. The two experiments are done with different\nsets of features and different scale choices.\n4.1 Musical instrument recognition\nThe task of instrument recognition presents the advantages\nof being well deÔ¨Åned and strongly related to the audio con-\ntent. This is why we run the Ô¨Årst experiment on a database\ncontaining a set of solo real-music performances, featuring\nsix instruments: Piano, Guitar, Bassoon, Oboe, Cello and\nViolin. The database contains 73 Ô¨Åles (31 for training, 42\nfor testing), totalling 449 minutes of music. For each instru-\nment, we have between 28 and 39 minutes of performance\nin the training set, and between 22 and 64 minutes in the test\nset.\nFrom this data, we extract a selection of 30 feature coefÔ¨Å-\ncients obtained by applying Inertia Ratio Maximisation [13]\nto an initial set of cepstral, spectral, perceptual and temporal\nfeatures used in a previous work [10].\nWe extract these descriptors at four distinct scales. The\nshortest one ( S1) has an analysis window of L1= 320 ms,\nwhich is approximately the duration of an eighth note at\n90 BPM. The other scales ( S2,S3andS4) have windows\nof lengths 2L1,4L1and8L1. The frames do not overlap.\nOn this data, we trained our systems with 500 boosting\niterations, using trees of depth 1.\nEach example is annotated with one of the six instru-\nments. We decompose this multiclass problem into six\ndistinct bi-class problems, following the one-versus-all ap-\nproach. During the test phase, all decisions are integrated\nto the largest scale 8L1= 2.6s, and the most probable in-\nstrument is chosen. For the mono-scale systems with scalesshorter than 8L1, the late integration is done by summing\nthe classiÔ¨Åer output on the frames within the considered de-\ncision range.\nWith these predictions on the test set, we calculate the\nrecognition rate as:\nR= meani 1H(xi)=yi (2)\n4.2 Multi-tag classiÔ¨Åcation using CAL500\nFor this experiment, we use the CAL500 database [16],\na database containing 500 pop songs, annotated by non-\nexperts through a survey. Each song has been annotated by\nat least three people. We keep the 61 tags used in [2]. These\ntags describe different properties of the whole songs, such\nas: mood, genre, instrument, etc.\nTests are conducted using 10-fold cross-validation, with\n450 songs used for training, and 50 songs for testing. The\ntest sets are not overlapping between the different folds. For\ncomplexity reduction, we only use 30s of each song: ex-\ntracted between instants 30 s and 60 s.\nThe features we use for describing each frame of signal\nare: the 15 psychoacoustic-related features recommended\nin [19] (loudness, tonal dissonance, . . . ), completed by the\ncommon Ô¨Årst 13 MFCC (dropping the energy), chroma,\nzero-crossing rate, and spectral spread, skewness and kur-\ntosis.\nWe have chosen Ô¨Åve different scales: frames covering 2,\n3.3, 5.5, 9 and 15 s of signal, with 50% overlap. A prelim-\ninary experiment indicated that, for this kind of data, scales\nunder 2 s were less useful. And we also considered that\n15 s was long enough to capture a wide range of long-term\nphenomena. The other scales are chosen to have a constant\nlogarithmic spacing between each consecutive values.\nWe examine the performance on the test set, with 100\nboosting iterations, using the same two evaluation measures\nas in [2]. These ranking metrics measure the ability of a soft\nprediction system to output higher scores for relevant doc-\numents compared to irrelevant ones. Soft predictions are\nnon-binary scores, representing the amount of conÔ¨Ådence\nthe predictor has in the positive association of a considered\ntag to a given song. We can obtain soft outputs from our\nsystem, simply by averaging instead of thresholding the Ô¨Å-\nnal decision:\nÀúDa= meani‚ààaH(xi) (3)\nThis framework will make performance evaluation indepen-\ndent from the detection threshold t, that we choose for Equa-\ntion 1.\nFrom these decisions, we compute the Mean Average\nPrecision (MAP) and Area under the ROC3curve (AUC).\nFor a precise description of their calculation, see [8].\n3Receiver Operating Characteristic.\n66612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nScale Recognition rate (in %)\nS1 59.8\nS2 53.0\nS3 62.9\nS4 44.2\nMulti-Scale 64.5\nTable 1 .

Performance of the different systems on CAL500.\n4.3 Results and discussion\nThe recognition rates yielded by the different systems on the\ninstrument database are presented in Table 1. It is found that\nthe multi-scale system has the best recognition rate. The\ndifference between multi-scale and scale 3 systems is sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant, according to a McNemar test [6], which yielded a\np-value of 0.003. This means that the difference is statisti-\ncally signiÔ¨Åcant with a 99.7% conÔ¨Ådence level.\nThe features selected by the trees along the boosting iter-\nations differ greatly from one instrument to another, but the\nmost selected scales are the shortest and the longest ones\n(S1andS4). Surprisingly, these two scales do not corre-\nspond to the best performing mono-scale systems. This may\nbe due to the fact that S1gives the most temporally precise\ndescription, while S4is good at taking decisions on a 2.6 s\ndecision range, since it has the same length. Most of all,\nthis indicates that the information brought by the whole set\nof scales is structurally different from just one scale.\nA closer look at the detailed results, on a per-instrument\nbasis, also revealed that the multiscale system is not the best\nperforming one for all instruments. However, its perfor-\nmance is less variable among instruments. This shows that\nthe multi-scale approach performs best, as it is more Ô¨Çexi-\nble, and can focus on the most appropriate representation.\nThe results for the multi-tag task on CAL500 are pre-\nsented in Table 2. The best MAP and AUC are given bythe multi-scale system using trees of depth 1. The statisti-\ncal signiÔ¨Åcance of the difference between this system and\nthe best performing mono-scale one has been veriÔ¨Åed by a\ncross-validated paired ttest [6]. This test indicated a signif-\nicance of more than 99%.\nDepth 1 trees yield better results for the multi-scale sys-\ntems, but the choice of depth seems to have variable effects\namong mono-scale systems.\nFor comparison, in [2], the authors obtain a MAP and\nAUC of 0.54 and 0.73, respectively, on the same data and\ntags. But their system uses content-based and context-based\ninformation, whereas the one presented in this paper only\nrelies on the audio content. However, the focus of this study\nis intentionally set on the methodological validation of the\nalgorithm proposed, rather than achieving the best possi-\nble performance. Though, it shall be noticed that the abil-\nity of our new algorithm to handle data drawn on different\nscales makes it applicable to descriptors of different seman-\ntic levels, especially semantic information that may be valid\nat a smaller scale than the entire song (type of instrument,\ntempo, etc.). This very kind of data fusion will be explored\nin future works.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWe proposed a new multi-scale fusion system for classiÔ¨Å-\ncation that is designed to be convenient for fusing hetero-\ngeneous features, both in terms of content description and\nscale. Fusion is done thanks to an adapted boosting algo-\nrithm using decision trees.\nIn this study, we focused on validating the ability of the\nproposed system to conveniently fuse features expressed at\ndifferent scales. We experimented two classiÔ¨Åcation tasks\nand the results show that the multi-scale system is the best\none. Future work will study the ability of the system to fuse\nfeatures that are describing different aspects of the musical\npieces of interest, both in terms of content and scale.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] L.

INTRODUCTION\nContent-based Music Information Retrieval (MIR) aims at\nautomatically extracting higher-level concepts from musi c\ndata in order to enhance methods for an intelligent and user-\nfriendly management of music collections. Here, informa-\ntion about the instrumentation plays a fundamental role in\nthe semantic description of a music piece. Given the sizes\nof nowadays music archives, typical MIR applications such\nas indexing or retrieval demand for algorithms with low or\nmoderate computational load. However, related literature in\nthe Ô¨Åeld of automatic musical instrument recognition from\npolyphonies mostly concentrated on developing discrimi-\nnation strategies, while disregarding aspects related to t he\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval .computational complexity of the algorithms. Therefore,\nmany approaches towards musical instrument recognition\nare costly and were designed for simpliÔ¨Åed test scenarios\n(e.g. [7, 8]). Furthermore, global properties of the music r e-\nlated to the instrumentation, which can help to reduce the\namount of data to analyse and improve recognition robust-\nness, were either only partially used or completely neglect ed\n(e.g. [1,9,10]). Moreover, most of the works incorporate re -\nstrictions such as reduced number of instruments, aseptic o r\nlimited data, and/or other a priori assumptions (e.g. [3, 6] ).\nIn general, the auditory scene produced by a musical com-\nposition can be regarded as a multiple source environment,\nwhere the different sound sources ‚Äì the musical instruments\n‚Äì are temporarily active, while often recurring along the\npiece. We therefore expect that the instrumentation‚Äôs tem-\nporal evolution of a given music piece shows a repetitive\ncharacter, so that the information related to the individua l\nsources becomes redundant (we may extract a few labels\nfrom a thousands of audio frames). This suggests that, for\nautomatic recognition systems, analysing only a fraction o f\nthe data is enough to extract the available information.\nThereby the overall computational load of such algorithms\nis reduced which enables the implementation of fast recog-\nnition systems, indispensable for analysing big music col-\nlections. Moreover, this so-obtained data reduction can fu r-\nther be exploited by any other MIR related algorithm, e.g.\nmusic visualisation or summarisation.\nIn the present work we study the effect of data reduc-\ntion on instrument recognition performance from entire mu-\nsic pieces for real world applications, e.g. music collecti on\nindexing. We thereby address two of the above-identiÔ¨Åed\naspects lacking in the related literature, namely the devel -\nopment of both robust and efÔ¨Åcient methods for automatic\ninstrument recognition. In particular, we introduce and co m-\npare several track-level approaches, i.e. aimed to roughly\nassign labels to a whole track, which pre-process a given\nmusic piece to output a set of segments. Labels are then in-\nferred from these segments using our previously presented\n239Poster Session 2\npitched \nlabelling \ndrumset \ndetection 11 \nraw audio0\nfilter /theta.ipa1multiclass \nSVM \nbinary\nSVM piano drums \nvoice sax \nfilter /theta.ipa2filter /theta.ipa3framing & \nfeature\nextraction \nFigure 1 .

We further show that by applying\nthis methodology we can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the amount of\ndata needed for analysis, while maintaining high recogni-\ntion performance. In doing so we explore the redundancy of\nthe information along a music track, and study the inÔ¨Çuence\nof locally obtained data on recognition, i.e. how much data\nneeds to be extracted from which part of the track to obtain\na sufÔ¨Åcient description of its instrumentation.\nSince our focus lies on developing approaches for real\nworld applications, e.g. music collection indexing, we do\nnot impose any restrictions on the input data, hence evaluat -\ning our approaches only on music pieces taken from real\nrecordings. Furthermore, all information used in the la-\nbelling process is directly taken from the mixture signal wi th-\nout applying a priori information.\nBelow, we Ô¨Årst present the basic methodology to extract\ninstrumental labels from an unknown musical excerpt\nof arbitrary length (Sec. 2). We then give details about the\ndifferent approaches to process entire pieces of music\n(Sec. 3), which is followed by a description of the data used\nin the experiments (Sec. 4). In Sec. 5 we deÔ¨Åne the evalua-\ntion metrics and present the obtained results. After a discu s-\nsion, Sec. 6 concludes this article.\n2. LABEL INFERENCE\nHere we describe the basic process of extracting instrumen-\ntal labels given an unknown audio excerpt of arbitrary lengt h.\nFirst, the method sequentially applies previously trained pre-\ndominant instrument classiÔ¨Åers to the audio. The resulting\nframe series is then analysed to extract the labels (Fig. 1).\n2.1 ClassiÔ¨Åcation\nTo extract information about musical instruments from a\nshort section of the audio signal we applied parts of the\nwork previously presented in [4]. That is, our method uses\nstatistical models of predominant musical instruments to e s-\ntimate the presence of both pitched and percussive instru-\nments for a 3-seconds excerpt of a polyphonic mixture sig-\nnal. In particular, we applied the support vector machine\n(SVM) model1for 11 pitched instruments ( Cello ,Clarinet ,\n1We used the libSVM implementation, available at http://www.\ncsie.ntu.edu.tw/ Àúcjlin/libsvm/ .Flute ,acoustic andelectric Guitar ,Hammond Organ ,Pi-\nano,Saxophone ,Trumpet ,Violin , and singing Voice ) as de-\nveloped in [4] (‚Äúmulticlass SVM‚Äù in Fig. 1), and a sepa-\nrate model for estimating the presence of the drumkit (‚Äúbi-\nnary SVM‚Äù in Fig. 1). Both SVMs output probabilistic es-\ntimates, i.e. a real value between 0 and 1, for each of the\ntarget classes. The models were trained with automatically\npre-selected low-level audio features, describing the spe ctral\nand pitch related properties of the signal2, extracted from\nproper training data. In particular, the features were com-\nputed frame-wise in the applied 3 second window, using a\nframe size of 46 ms with 50% overlap, and integrated over\ntime via mean and variance statistics of the instantaneous\nand Ô¨Årst difference values.\nThe training data itself consisted of 3 second excerpts\ncontaining predominant pitched target instruments, taken\nfrom more than 2,000 ‚Äì presumably polytimbral ‚Äì music\nrecordings [4]. Besides for training the pitched instrumen ts\nmodel, this collection was also annotated according to the\npresence of the drumkit, i.e. labels drums andno-drums , and\nused for constructing the percussive classiÔ¨Åer.\n2.2 Labelling\nTo extract labels of an audio signal of arbitrary length, the\nmethod Ô¨Årst sequentially applies the above-described clas -\nsiÔ¨Åers, using a hop size of 0.5 sec. The temporal behaviour\nof the obtained probabilistic time series is then exploited\nfor label inference. Since the output of the pitched and the\npercussive model is merged (Fig. 1), we developed separate\napproaches corresponding to each of the two models for ex-\ntracting the desired labels.\n2.2.1 Percussive Instruments\nFirst, a decision boundary of 0.5 is applied to binarize each\nprediction of the classiÔ¨Åer. Then, a majority vote among all\nso-obtained binary decisions of the analysed signal is per-\nformed to indicate the target label. The corresponding con-\nÔ¨Ådence value is set to the relative amount of positive binary\ndecisions.\n2.2.2 Pitched Instruments\nThe method Ô¨Årst uses the mean values of each instrument‚Äôs\nprobabilistic curve along the analysed audio to determine\nthose instruments for label analysis. Thereby a threshold Œ∏1\nis applied to these mean values; if all of them fall below\nthe threshold, the whole audio under analysis is skipped and\nnot labelled at all, indicating a potential confusion due to\nunknown or heavily overlapped instruments. If approved,\na second threshold Œ∏2is applied to the mean values; if an\n2A complete list of all applied audio features can be accessed\nunderhttp://mtg.upf.edu/system/files/publications/\nismir11_ffuhrmann_sup.pdf .\n24012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ninstrument falls below this threshold, it is regarded as ina c-\ntive and not used in the further analysis. The probabilistic\ncurves of the remaining instruments are then searched for\nsections, where a single instrument predominates the mix-\nture, i.e. it holds the highest probability value among all i n-\nstruments for a certain minimal amount of time. If such a\nsection is found, the corresponding instrument is added to\nthe list of labels for the analysed audio, along with a conÔ¨Å-\ndence value as deÔ¨Åned by the section‚Äôs length relative to the\noverall length of the audio3. This process is repeated for all\ndetermined active instrument. Finally, a label threshold Œ∏3\nis applied to discard unreliable tags.

An example of the labelling method for pitched\ninstruments. The main Ô¨Ågure shows the probabilistic es-\ntimates for sources A-E, the right panel the mean values\ntogether with the thresholds used for instrument Ô¨Åltering.\nSince E is discarded as its mean value falls below Œ∏2, the\ncurves A-D are scanned for sections, where a single instru-\nments predominates. Depending on the parameter for the\nminimal length of these sections, up to three different in-\nstruments can be detected here (a,c,d ‚ÜíA,C,B), whereas\nsections containing instrument confusions are not used for\nlabelling (b).\n3. TRACK-LEVEL APPROACHES\nIn this section we present 4 different approaches to process\nand label an entire piece of music. Since the instrumenta-\ntion and its temporal evolution of a piece of music usually\nfollows a clear structural scheme, we expect, inside a given\nmusic track, a certain degree of repetitiveness of its diffe rent\ninstrumentations. This property of music and the resulting\nredundancy is exploited by the described approaches to re-\n3For multiple occurrences of the same instrument the respective conÔ¨Å-\ndence values are summed.C3 C2 C1 ALL \n30SEC \nNSEG\nCLU \nFigure 3 .

We then apply the label\ninference method described in Sec. 2 on their respective out -\nput and evaluate the algorithms in terms of labelling perfor -\nmance and the amount of used data. In short, the presented\napproaches are accounting ‚Äì some of them more than others\n‚Äì for the time-varying character of instrumentation inside a\nmusic piece. Their output consist of a set of segments which\nare then used to infer the instrumental labels for the given\nmusic track. Fig. 3 depicts the underlying ideas.\n3.1 All-frame processing ( ALL )\nProbably the most straightforward approach given the above -\ndescribed labelling methodology. By processing all frames\nwe automatically account for the time-varying character of\nmusical instruments via a global analysis of the track. How-\never, no data reduction is performed. Since this approach\nuses all data available, it acts as a kind of upper baseline bo th\nin terms of recognition performance and amount of data pro-\ncessed, which all other methods using less data compete\nwith.\n3.2 30 seconds ( 30SEC )\nThis widely used approach in MIR assumes that by reduc-\ning the data to 30 sec of audio most of the semantic infor-\nmation is maintained. Many genre, mood, or artist classiÔ¨Å-\ncation systems use an excerpt of this length to represent an\nentire music track (e.g. [11]). The process can be regarded\nas an extrapolation of the locally obtained information to\nthe global scope, i.e. the entire piece of music. Since the\naforementioned concepts are rather stable across one sin-\ngle piece, the data reduction does not affect the signiÔ¨Åcanc e\nof the obtained results. However, instrumentations usuall y\nchange with time, so that the targeted information is inade-\nquately represented by this data amount. In our experiments\nwe extracted the data from 0 to 30 sec of the track.\n241Poster Session 2\n3.3 Segment sampling ( NSEG )\nHere, we obtain excerpts by uniformly sampling the track\nto incorporate the time-varying characteristics of instru men-\ntation. This enables a local extraction of the information\nwhich is combined to a global estimate of the instrumental\nlabels. In particular we extract nequal-distant excerpts of\n10 seconds length from the track (for nequals 1 or 2 a sin-\ngle segment from the beginning, or one segment from the\nbeginning and the end of the music track is taken, respec-\ntively). The labels inferred from each of the segments are\nthen merged, where small values of nlead to a great data\nreduction while still considering the instrumentation‚Äôs t ime-\nvarying character. The parameter nis kept variable for the\nexperiments conducted in Sec. 5.\n3.4 Cluster representation ( CLU )\nCertainly the most elaborated approach from the perceptual\npoint-of-view; a given piece of music is represented with a\ncluster structure where each cluster corresponds to a diffe r-\nent instrumentation. This approach explicitly uses an esti -\nmate of the global distribution of the musical instruments\nto locally infer the labels from a reduced set of the data by\nexploiting redundancies of the instrumentations inside th e\npiece of music. In particular, it applies unsupervised seg-\nmentation and clustering algorithms to locate the differen t\ninstrumentations and their repetitions. At the end, only on e\nsegment per cluster is taken for further analysis. Hence thi s\napproach is directly exploiting repetitions in the instrum en-\ntation to reduce the amount of data to process, while the\nlocal continuity of the individual instruments is preserve d to\nguarantee a maximum in recognition performance.\n3.4.1 Segmentation\nSince instrumentation is closely related to timbre, a timbr al\nrepresentation of the track is processed to Ô¨Ånd local change s\ntherein, applying an unsupervised segmentation algorithm\nbased on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [2]. To\nrepresent timbre the approach uses 13 frame-wise extracted\nMel Frequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs).\n3.4.2 Clustering\nHere, an agglomerative clustering step builds a hierarchic al\ntree (i.e. a so-called dendrogram) on the pair-wise similar -\nities of all generated segments. The segments are merged\niteratively to form the tree, where a linkage method fur-\nther measures proximities between groups of segments at\nhigher levels [12]. The Ô¨Ånal clusters are then found by cut-\nting the tree according to an inconsistency coefÔ¨Åcient, whi ch\nmeasures the compactness of each link in the tree. Fur-\nthermore, to estimate the pair-wise segment similarities, we\nmodel each segment as a single Gaussian distribution of theraw MFCC frames with diagonal covariance matrix and cal-\nculate the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) be-\ntween pairs of segments.\nFinally, the longest segment of each resulting cluster is\npassed to the label inference algorithm. The predictions\nfrom all segments are then merged to form the set of labels\nfor the track under analysis.\n4. DATA\nFor our experiments we used a data corpus consisting of 220\nmusic pieces taken from various genres of Western music.\nIn these tracks, all perceptually audible instruments were an-\nnotated manually along with their start and end times. Since\nno limitations in the vocabulary size were imposed to the\nhuman annotators, this evaluation data includes, addition al\nto the 12 modelled classes, instruments which are not mod-\nelled by the classiÔ¨Åer. Moreover, if the annotator could not\nrecognize a certain instrument‚Äôs sound, the label unknown\nwas used4.\nAn analysis of the set of labels used in the annotations\nrevealed 28 different instrumental categories, at which th e\nlabel unknown was the third-most frequently used, directly\nafter the labels bass anddrums . It should be noted that none\nof the tracks used for training the instrumental models was\nused in this evaluation collection.\n5. GENERAL RESULTS\n5.1 Metrics\nTo estimate the labelling performance we regarded the prob-\nlem as multi-class, multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation. That is, ea ch\ninstance to evaluate can hold an arbitrary number of unique\nlabels of a given dictionary. Given a collection of music\ntracks X={xi},i= 1... N , with Nitems, we deÔ¨Åne,\nrespectively, ÀÜY={ÀÜyi},i= 1... N , and ÀúY={Àúyi},i=\n1... N , the set of ground truth and predicted labels for each\nxi.

For each turn we\nused the data of 2 folds for estimating the optimal parame-\nter settings and subsequently tested on the remaining fold.\nWe then obtained mean values and corresponding standard\ndeviations by averaging the evaluation results of the respe c-\ntive predictions of all three runs5.\nThe upper panel of Table 1 contains the results (mean\nvalues) of the CV obtained for the studied algorithms. The\nparameter nof the NSEG method was set to 3 and 6, gen-\nerating systems processing 30 sec ( 3SEG ‚Äì an equivalent\nin terms of data size to the 30SEC method) and 1 min of\naudio data ( 6SEG ). Additionally, Ô¨Ågures regarding the rela-\ntive amount of data used for label inference are shown in the\nlower panel (relative with respect to the all-frame process ing\nalgorithm ALL). A lower bound was generated by drawing\neach label from its respective prior binomial distribution , in-\nferred from all tracks of the collection, averaging the resu lt-\ning performance over 100 independent runs ( PRIOR ).\nTable 1 .Precision, recall, and F measures of the studied\napproaches together with the relative amount of data used\nfor label inference (data).

The segmentation and clustering preserves the tem-\nporal continuity of the instrumentation, therefore exhibi ting\nless data variability, ensuring the high value of the Pmetric.\nThe same local continuity of musical instruments otherwise\nenforces the lower recall value in the 30SEC approach, in\ncomparison to the 3SEG method. However, with more anal-\nysed segments from different parts of the track, the variati on\nin the data increases. This affects the recall value R, result-\ning in a trade-off between the two aforementioned metrics.\nFurthermore, the similar performance Ô¨Ågures of the CLU\nand ALL approaches suggest that there exists a minimal\namount of data from which all the extractable information\ncan be derived6. Hence more data will then not result in an\nimprovement of the labelling performance. The next section\nwill examine this phenomenon in more detail, in particular\nby determining the minimum of audio data required to max-\nimize labelling performance.\n5.3 Scaling and computational aspects\nThe observations in the previous section suggest that there\nseems to be a strong amount of repetitiveness present inside\na music piece. Additionally, many excerpts ‚Äì even though\ndiffering in instrumentation ‚Äì produce the same label outpu t\nwhen processed with the used label inference method. To\nquantify those effects we used the CLU andNSEG meth-\nods to process the entire piece under analysis, as both offer\na straightforward way to vary the amount of data used by\nthe label inference algorithm. In particular, we studied th e\neffect of an increasing amount of segments to process on\nthe labelling performance. In case of the NSEG method we\nconstantly increased the amount of segments used by the la-\nbel inference, thus augmenting the method‚Äôs parameter n.\nFor the CLU method we sorted the clusters downwards by\nthe accumulated length of their respective segments, start ed\nprocessing just the Ô¨Årst one, and iteratively added the next\nlongest cluster. For both methods we then tracked the per-\nformance Ô¨Ågures as well as the amount of data used for in-\nference. Fig. 4 depicts both performance and amount of data\nfor the Ô¨Årst 20 steps on the evaluation data (mean value of\nCV outputs).\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4 the performance of both CLU\nandNSEG systems stagnates at a certain amount of seg-\nments processed. Due to the different amount of data pro-\ncessed, those values represent, respectively, 3 and 5 seg-\nments. Hence, incorporating global timbral structure, as i m-\nplemented by CLU , beneÔ¨Åts labelling performance at the ex-\n6The small differences in PandRresult from individual parameter set-\ntings, estimated by the CV by determining the best performing co nÔ¨Ågura-\ntion in respect to the Fmetric, and can be compensated by manually choos-\ning proper values.

By preserving the con -\ntinuity of musical instruments the method shows a slightly\nsuperior performance compared to NSEG , which segment\nextraction is unaware of any contextual properties. In term s\nof the used data amount, NSEG is superior whilst process-\ning less than around 40% of the data (i.e. n‚â§10), whereas\nwhen processing more, CLU returns the better overall la-\nbelling performance. However, the results suggest that, on\naverage, a timbre-informed clustering does not result in a\nsigniÔ¨Åcant increase in performance, thus it might be of ad-\nvantage in specialized applications (e.g. working on a sing le\ngenre which exhibits clear recurrent structural sections) .\nFinally, the stagnation of labelling performance indicate s\na kind-of ‚Äúglass ceiling‚Äù that has been reached. It seems tha t\nwith the presented classiÔ¨Åcation and labelling methodolog y\nwe are not able to extract more information about the instru-\nmentation. Nevertheless, we can observe that predominant\ninstrumental information is highly redundant inside a give n\nWestern piece of music from which 70% of the labels can be\nobtained. Furthermore, this fact allows for a reduction of t he\neffective amount of data used for label inference of around\n55%. Remarkably, the same factor of about 1/2can also be\nobserved when comparing the number of different instru-\nmentations to the overall number of segments in the ground\ntruth annotations of all Ô¨Åles in the used music collection.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this article we studied the problem of extracting labels\ncorresponding to the instrumentation from entire pieces of\nmusic. We designed our approach to be applied in a real\nworld context, hence the presented methods work on any\npiece of music, without imposing restrictions to the inputdata. In particular we analysed different methods to pre-\nprocess the entire tracks, studying the effect of data reduc -\ntion on recognition performance. Evaluation on a dataset of\n220 musical pieces showed that by using the best perform-\ning approach we are able to score a global F-measure of\n0.69 while examining 12 musical instruments. On the other\nhand, a proper preprocessing of the data allows for a reduc-\ntion of the amount of data used for label inference of more\nthan 50% while the recognition performance is preserved.\n7.

INTRODUCTION \nMusic performance adds interpretative information to the \nshorthand representation in a music score [1]. These per-formance dimensions can be extracted from performance \naudio as musical expressive features using signal processing algorithms as in [2]. These features quantitative-ly model the performance dimensions that reflect both the \ninterpretation of performance musicians and the artistic in-\ntention of composers [1] and are important for various mu-sic signal processing [2] and se mantic musical data analysis \n[3,4] applications.        Existing automatic music transcription [5] and musical \nexpressive feature extraction al gorithms [2] are designed in \npost-processing frameworks. Th ese existing algorithms are \nessentially multimedia file pr ocess systems, which assume \nthat the entire duration of the audio performance is already \nrecorded. However, various real-time signal processing ap-\nplications, such as visualization, automatic music mixing, stage lighting control, interactive music media, and elec-tronic games, require that mu sical expressive features be \nextracted and synchronized with the ongoing audio. In such a real-time signal processing framework, the musical ex-\npressive features have to be obtained from the audio signal \nthat is still in progression to facilitate simultaneous interac-tions with external applications. Thus, the complete music event is not observed at the ‚Äúd ecision point‚Äù since the mu-\nsic transcription and expressive features have to be obtained \nat (or shortly after) the onset of each music event. In this \npaper we extend the feature extraction and recognition functionalities of conventional music transcription and musical expressive feature ex traction algorithms and estab-\nlish a real-time processing fr amework which includes the \nprocessing stages of prediction, estimation and updating. \nFirst, signal features (signal features here include segmenta-\ntion features, score-level features and musical expressive features) are predicted using generative probabilistic graph-\nical models [6,7] based on a ‚Äúh istory‚Äù of these features (or \nother available information, e. g., features extracted from a \nsynchronized rehearsal track) . Then we estimate these sig-\nnal features when a short audio segment in the beginning \npart of a music event is available. When additional audio frames are captured, we refine the estimations and make necessary updating.   \n     ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù real-time methods can only be achieved in a fea-\nture prediction framework: the signal features are obtained \nbefore the actual music event. For example, in an automatic \nmusic mixing system, we are ex pected to adjust the fader \nsettings according to the ‚Äúpast‚Äù signal features before  a \nloud section begins.  That is, the expressive loudness fea-ture and its related fader instruction must be generated at a \n¬†\nPermission to make digital or hard copi es of all or part of this work fo r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or  commercial advantage and that cop-\nies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  \n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n115Poster Session 1\n  \n \ntime point when the music event of the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù loud sec-\ntion is not observed at all! In our proposed processing framework, a generative probabilistic graphical model [6] is \nemployed to enable such predictions. A probabilistic graph-\nical model depicts the causalit y (or statistical) relations be-\ntween signal features [7]. A prediction of ‚Äúfuture‚Äù signal \nfeatures is inferred from these statistical relations and a fi-nite length of an observed ‚Äúhistory‚Äù. Such predictions might fail, as any prediction that peeks into an unknown \n‚Äúfuture‚Äù. To improve the reliability of our proposed system, \nseveral levels of relaxation are applied. These pseudo-real-time processing frameworks are essentially buffer and post-processing frameworks that allow us to take glimpses at the music event and be more ‚Äúco nfident‚Äù.  If the signal \nprocessing delays they introduce are kept within the percep-\ntual limit (about 25ms [8]), the live performance, audio and \nthe feature processing results would appear to be percep-tually well synchronized for the audience.  \n       A pseudo-real-time processing framework allows a \nshort audio frame to be captu red near the predicted music \nnote onset. The signal features extracted from this short au-\ndio frame confirms or rejects the predicted onset location and other signal feature dimensions. If the pseudo-real-time constrains, including the percep tual delay limit and/or the \naudio reinforcement delay limit, are satisfied, a short signal capturing and processing delay would be effectively con-\ncealed from the audience. The perceptual delay limit is the \nlimit of human perceptual capabilities of discerning the time sequence of two perceptual events [8,9]. For applica-tion scenarios such as visualization, a short delay such as 10ms in the visualization interface is not perceptible since human visual perception is a relatively slow responding \nprocess [9]. However, a proc essing delay that exceeds 20ms \nresults in a sloppy ‚Äúthunder first, lightning second‚Äù effect.  An audio reinforcement delay can be utilized in application scenarios where sound reinforc ement systems are employed \nto further enhance synchronizations. The reinforced sound \nis briefly delayed to compensate for the signal processing \ndelays so the reinforced sound is still synchronized with the feature extraction and processing results\n1. Because the sig-\nnal features extracted usually trigger the most dramatic vis-\n                                                           \n1 In a staged music setting, for instan ce, the music expressive features and \nthe aural-visual events controlled by these features are delayed behind the \nonset of stage scenes because a short audio frame have to be captured and \nprocessed. Taking the stage light cont rol application as an example, the \nlight controlled by loudness feature tu rns on 10ms after an actor begin to \nsing a music phrase. In this ‚Äúprecious‚Äù 10ms, a short audio frame is cap-\ntured and analyzed so the ‚Äúlight on ‚Äù stage lighting instruction could be \ninferred. The reinforced audio is also  delayed 10ms to compensate for the \ndelay of the lighting effect. For the a udience the reinforced audio onset is \nperfectly synchronized with the lighting effect since they are both delayed 10ms behind the actor, while the 10ms delay between stage scene and au-\ndio/lighting is still imperceptible.\n      ual and aural events and the reinforced audio carries the \nmost prominent aural event, this audio reinforcement delay effectuates the most critical synchronizations and is thus \nstrongly recommended whenever applicable. The sound \nreinforcement delay must be kept low (less than 20ms, with a typical value of 10ms) to maintain the perceptual syn-chronizations of other aural and visual events. On the aural aspect, the audio reinforcement delay limit ensures that the direct sound from actors can blend seamlessly with the \nreinforced sound for front-row audiences. On the visual \nside, the reinforced audio lags behind the stage scenes so this limit insures that the time lag is perceptually tolerable.     \n     The proposed system architecture as detailed in Sec. 2 \nutilizes both real-time music event prediction and pseudo-real-time processing, with an  emphasis on pseudo-real-time \nprocessing. Key processing components are introduced in \nSec. 3. Sec. 4 discusses the MATLAB implementation is-sues and Sec. 5 provides a brief summary. \n2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \nThe system architecture of our proposed system is illu-\nstrated in Figure 1. Figure 1( a) is the system architecture \nfor application scenarios when a music score database is available and a matching music score is retrieved. In the initialization phase, a short audio segment (5-20 seconds) is first captured as the audio qu ery for finding the matching \nmusic score using score-audio matching algorithms [10]. \nThe feature estimation blocks include audio segmentation \nand features extraction algo rithm. The real-time score-\naudio alignment algorithm segments the audio by identify-ing the onset points based on the music score and the seg-mentation features extracted from the audio. If a music on-set is detected, the following short audio frame is captured \nand passed on to the musical expressive feature extraction \nalgorithm to obtain an initial estimation of musical expres-sive features. These musical ex pressive features are then \nformatted as a control data stre am for external applications. \nFigure 1(b) presents alternat ive system architecture for the \napplication scenarios when a music score is not available. \nIn this system we implement a real-time music transcription framework parallel with the real-time musical expressive feature extraction process. Fo r both systems music event \nprediction and feature updating algorithms are implemented to further improve performance. The music event prediction \nalgorithm predicts the ‚Äúfutur e‚Äù feature values based on a \n‚Äúhistory‚Äù and use the prediction values as priors for the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù music event segmentation and feature estimation process. The alignment/featur e updating algorithm refines \nsignal features when additional audio frames are captured and submits essential corrections. The refined features also \nimprove subsequent probabilistic predictions. \n11612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 1 .

REAL-TIME PROCESSING ALGORITHMS \nReal-time processing algorithms for key functional blocks \nare introduced in this section. Algorithms both for applica-\ntion scenarios with and with out a music score are intro-\nduced.   \n3.1 Audio Segmentation \nIf a music score is available, the note boundaries are identi-\nfied using score-audio alignment or score following algo-rithms based on real-time dynamic time warping as detailed \nin [10]. These algorithms optimally align a music score to \nthe dynamic performance timeline of an audio file by searching-and-finding an optimal alignment path corres-ponding to the alignment featur es extracted from the score \nand the audio.  \n    If music score is not available, the conventional onset \ndetection and music event segmentation algorithms [11] are extended to f it in our proposed real-time processing \nframework. These onset detection algorithms compare the audio features (for example, energy value or spectrograph-\nic content) and track their variations. The magnitude of the \nvariations is encoded as an onset detection function ‹¶·à∫›ê·àª  \nand the time points correspond to significant variation are selected as onsets or segmentation points. In our proposed real-time framework only the ‚Äòpast‚Äô part of the detection \nfunction ‹¶·à∫›ê·àª,›ê ‡µë ›ê\n‡Øñ is available, where ›ê‡Øñ is the current \ntime. To ensure real-time pr ocessing performance, we can-\nnot delay the segmentation decision until a downward \nslope of ‹¶·à∫›ê·àª is observed. Instead of peak-picking [11], the \nsegmentation decisions have to be generated using a thre-shold detection method, which do not guarantee that a \n‹¶·à∫›ê·àª peak is reached.  \n     Our proposed real-time processing framework is im-\nplemented by providing two types of threshold for onset \ndetection. An initial detection threshold is set as ›Ñ›ê\n‡¨µ. If \n‹¶·à∫›ê‡Øñ·àª‡µê›Ñ›ê ‡¨µ and no segmentation decisions have be gener-\nated in a time interval of  ›ê‡Øñ, an initial segmentation point \nis identified. A ‚Äòregretting‚Äô threshold is set as ›Ñ›ê‡¨∂. If \n‹¶·à∫›ê‡Øñ·àª‡µê›Ñ›ê ‡¨∂ and the time distance ›ê‡Ø• to the previous seg-\nmentation decision satisfies ›ê‡Ø•‡¨µ‡µë›ê ‡Ø•‡µë›ê ‡Ø•‡¨∂, a forward up-\ndating of the segmentation point is performed to erase an existing segmentation point a nd substitute the current time \npoint. Here ›ê\n‡Ø•‡¨µ is the segmentation error tolerance. If the \nprevious segmentation point is within this range, a correc-\ntion is not necessary. ›ê‡Ø•‡¨∂ is the maximum correction range. \nIf the time interval to the previous segmentation point is \ngreater than ›ê‡Ø•‡¨∂, another segmentation point is generated \nusing threshold ›Ñ›ê‡¨µ. These thresholds are time varying with \nthe current beat tracking result obtained using the algo-rithms in [12]. The rhythmically significant locations are assigned a lower detection threshold as in Fig. 2 to push detected onsets towards these interpolated locations, as a \ncombined process of prediction and real-time detection.   \n \nFigure 2 . A typical profile of segmentation detection \nthresholds.  The lower detection threshold at predicted \nrhythmic locations pushes the segmentation point towards \na predicted rhythmic grid. \n117Poster Session 1\n  \n \n3.2 Feature Extraction \nThe musical expressive features we implemented include \nfeature dimensions of the relatively small but continually \nchanging adjustments in pitch, timing, auditory loudness, \ntimbre, articulation and vibrato that performers use to create expression [1,2]. Defin itions of these feature dimen-\nsions are briefly summarized in Table 1 and more details can be found in [2]. In this section the real-time extraction \nprocess of symbolic pitch and expressive feature dimen-\nsion of pitch deviation is detailed in an application scenario \nwhen a music score is not available. Pitch deviation meas-ures the difference between performance pitch and the score specified pitch [2]. The expressive pitch processing \nis more sophisticated compared to other feature dimensions since the quantized score pitch, the expressive pitch devia-\ntions, and the calibration of a temperament grid\n1 have to be \nupdated simultaneously. The other feature dimensions are briefly summarized in Table 1 and their feature extraction algorithms are similar extensions based on [2].  \n      For estimation of pitc h deviation an accurate mapping \nbetween symbolic pitch and fundamental frequency (F0) \nhas to be established since the expressive pitch deviation is just a small fraction of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency is first obtained from the audio frames captured at the segmentation point using a pitch de-tection algorithm as in [13]. Suppose that the fundamental \nfrequency is detected from the first short audio frame of \nmusic note ›â and denoted as ›Ç\n·à∫‡¨µ·àª and the initial tempera-\nment grid we implemented as ‡µ£ ›Ç·àô‡Ø†,›Ç·àò‡Ø†;›Ç“ß‡Ø†,›å‡Ø†‡µß, ›â ‡µå\n1, ‚Ä¶ , ‹Ø . Here ›Ç·àô‡Ø† and ›Ç·àò‡Ø† is the decision boundary of the \npitch quantization grid. ›Ç“ß‡Ø† is the quantized frequency value \nthat would be selected if ›Ç·àô‡Ø†‡µë›Ç ‡Ø†‡µë ›Ç·àò‡Ø† and ›å‡Ø† is its sym-\nbolic value. For equal temper ament scale, the quantized \nvalue ›Ç“ß‡Ø†s form a temperament grid which is derived from a \nreference frequency point ›Ç“ß‡Øã with symbolic pitch value ›å‡Øã \nas: \n                ›Ç“ß‡Ø† ‡µå t p a ‡≠£·à∫›Ç“ß‡Øã,›å‡Øã;›å‡Ø†·àª‡µå  2‡≥õ‡≥ò‡∞∑‡≥õ‡≥É\n‡∞≠‡∞Æ ¬∑›Ç“ß‡Øã            (1) \nwhere ›å‡Ø† is the symbolic pitch value of quantization inter-\nval ·àæ›Ç·àô‡Ø†,›Ç·àò‡Ø†·àª,  here ›å‡Ø† and ›å‡Øã is specified in MIDI value. \nSince human frequency discernment is most acute at mid-\nfrequency region, the frequency reference point ·àæ›å‡Øã:›Ç“ß‡Øã·àø \ncould be selected at this frequency region. In our imple-mentation the reference point [69:440Hz] is selected. Us-\ning this initial temperament grid, we obtain the initial sym-\nbolic pitch value as ›å\n·à∫‡¨µ·àª. When additional audio frames are \ncaptured from the audio stream, we might revise our esti-\n                                                           \n1 For expressive feature extraction this  calibration is crucial because the \ncalibration level is within the same  range of pitch deviation value.    mation of the ›Ç·à∫‡¨µ·àª and ›å·à∫‡¨µ·àª values within a music note \nbased on the pitch detected in the extended musical note \nduration. To ensure a smooth updating process we only \nupdate the F0 estimation after a time interval. We also only update the estimated value of fundamental frequency and pitch deviation if the difference of two adjacent estimated F0 values will exceed the detection grid of one semitone.  \n      When an adequate number of music notes are captured, \nthe temperament grid is updated by fitting a temperament \ngrid to the detected F0 values in a calibration process.    Suppose the F0 sequence we obtained is represented as \n›Ç\n‡¨µ‚Ä¶›Ç ‡ØÜ, these frequency points find their quantized values \n›Ç“ß‡¨µ‚Ä¶›Ç“ß‡ØÜ as the nearest neighbors in an initial quantization \ngrid with frequency reference point ·àæ›å‡Øã:›Ç“ß‡Øã·àø. The residual \nvalues of this quantization process are denoted as ›Ä‡¨µ‚Ä¶›Ä ‡ØÜ. \nThen we shift the frequency reference point within 1/6 of a \nsemitone interval and find the best reference frequency \npoint ›Ç“ß‡Øã‡µÖ‚àÜ ›Ç “ß‡Øã where the sum of the residual values \n‚àë| ›Ä‡Ø†|‡ØÜ\n‡Ø†‡≠Ä‡¨µ  is minimized. After this calibration process the \nresidual frequency value ›Ä‡¨µ‚Ä¶›Ä ‡ØÜ is calculated as pitch \ndeviation values.

The statistical relations within a time series of audio features are codified using probabilistic graphical models [7] as a prediction framework to infer the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù feature values based on available observations.  \nComplete learning and inference algorithms of a music \nevent prediction framework are detailed in [6]. Most real-time applications require an early ‚Äúdecision point‚Äù, where \nthe available audio segment is still insufficient for unambi-guously estimating most feature dimensions. Thus in our \nproposed frameworks these probabilistic predictions are \nintegrated into the audio segmentation and feature extrac-tion process. The signal features are predicted before the onset of an actual music event as prior information for fea-ture estimations. Additional reference feature tracks includ-ing a music score or a matching expressive music transcrip-\ntion obtained from a rehearsal track can be further incorpo-\nrated in this prediction framework, as an extension to the alignment process that assigns  reference features as the \nprediction values to real-time music events. The integration \nof prediction and estimation also allows the prediction point to be closer to the ‚Äúdecision point‚Äù, as the shortened predic-\ntion distance enhances the prediction accuracy [6].   \n  \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \n3.4 Feature Updating \nThe real-time segmentation decision process here is essen-\ntially a hit-or-miss process: once a segmentation decision is made based on the audio signal features of the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù audio  frame  (we  may also utilize the ‚Äúpast‚Äù audio frames deposited in the captured signal stream and some predic-tion) any audio frames captured later will not count even if \nthe ‚Äòhit‚Äô (the attack point) is at the wrong place. If we \n‚Äúmiss‚Äù a segmentation point due to a stringent detection threshold, we may find that the subsequently captured au-dio frames are inappropriate for allocating a segmentation \npoint. The design of real-time feature extraction algorithms \nalso have to balance these requirements of real-time per-\nformance and feature accuracy. To reconcile these conflict-ing real-time performance criteria we implement an updat-ing mechanism which enables th e system to ‚Äúregret‚Äù pre-\nvious prediction/estimation when subsequent events in the audio stream are captured an d processed. These refine-\nments are buffered for improving future predictions and \nessential updates are submitted to the external applications. Although for some application scenarios a real-time deci-\nsion is irreversible, certain minor corrections can still be effectively disguised using perceptual models [9]. Because frequent revisions give the system user an unstable impres-\nsion, the number of segmentation point modifications must \nbe restricted. An example of a feature updating process is illustrated in Figure 3.

MATLAB IMPLEMENTATION \nIn a MATLAB real-time signal processing framework a ti-\nmer object [15] is implemented to handle the looping op-\neration and schedule the subsequent processing operations.  \nIn a timer  object loop a block of main code is executed ite-\nratively in a prescribed short time slot until an error or user interruption is detected. In our implementation the audio capturing and processing functionalities are programmed within the main timer  loop so for every timer  slot an audio \nframe is captured, analyzed and the feature data is submit-\nted to the external application. If the timer  slot is short \nenough (i.e., 10ms), the buffering and processing delay is negligible. If the capturing and processing time exceeds the allocated timer  object slot, the error handling function of \nthe timer  object is implemented. The error handling code \ncontains the same processing steps as in a regular \nprocessing timer slot and the code to resumes regular timer  \ncycles after error processing. This mechanism allows extra \nprocessing time when necessa ry. The audio capturing func-\ntionality is implemented by programming two audiorecord-\ner objects in each processing cy cle to make sure that there \nis no missing audio segment due to the processing delays. For the odd-numbered processing loops (including timer  \nloops and error handling loops), we capture the recorded audio segment from audiorecorder1, read the time location, \nclear and restart the recorder, and then append the audio \nsegment to the corresponding time location of the main au-\ndio stream for subsequent processing. For the even-numbered loops, we perform the same instructions on audi-\norecorder2 . In MATLAB, multiple audiorecorder  objects \nare run-time independent so their functionalities are per-formed simultaneously without interference.   \n5. SUMMARY \nOur proposed real-time signal processing framework of \nmusical expressive feature ex traction obtains musical fea-\ntures from an incoming audio stream and provides impor-tant music data for various multimedia applications such as \nvisualization, electronic game s, interactive media and au-\ntomatic music production. By implementing a processing framework that combines prediction, estimation and updat-ing, musical features are obtai ned at the music note onset. \nThis capability effectively sy nchronizes the musical expres-\nsive features with interactive content and avoids the delay \neffect of conventional post -processing frameworks. The \nproposed updating processing enables important feature modifications to be updated to  the user interface when addi-\ntional lengths of audio signal are captured. In a perfor-mance evaluation the performa nce of our proposed real-\ntime processing framework and an automatic post-\nprocessing framework [2] is compared with a benchmark dataset of manually annotated musical feature analysis. If \nany feature dimension of automatic processing is different from the benchmark dataset, the music note is considered \nan error. The error rate is th en calculated as the proportion \nof notes with errors. The test dataset is composed of oboe performance recordings that contain 162 music notes. The \nerror rate of real-time processi ng without music score, real-\ntime processing with music score, post-processing without music score, and post-processing with music score is \n19.75% (14.81% after update), 3.70% (1.23% after up-\ndates), 13.58%, and 1.23% respectively. These perfor-mances prove to be adequate for our proposed applications. \n6. REFERENCES \n[1] H. Schenker and H. Esser (Ed.), and I. S.

INTRODUCTION\nSince the beginning of the 15th century, motivic elements\nhave made part of Western music, becoming common prac-\ntice during the 18th century. We can Ô¨Ånd numerous exam-\nples of this phenomenon nowadays in modern pop/rock mu-\nsic which contain repetitive sub-structures, e.g., the chorus,\nverse, etc. According to [5], such repetitive structures, or\nmotifs , act as cues in music perception. ‚ÄúA cueis a very\nrestricted entity ... often shorter than the group itself, but\nalways embodying striking attributes‚Äù. This notion of cue,\nwould let a listener encode information in a more efÔ¨Åcient\nway, allowing longer structures to be memorized by means\nof smaller, more salient, features.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Although motifs can be found in a song‚Äôs harmony or\nmelody, in this paper we will focus on harmonic motifs for\nthree reasons: (i) many songs share a part of their harmonic\nstructure, as the number of chord progressions that are pop-\nular in a musical style ( idioms ) remain limited, while the\nmelodic structure can vary greatly from one song to an-\nother; (ii) studies in experimental psychology have shown\nthe essential role of harmony in musical sequence percep-\ntion [6]; (iii) although the amount of chord progression data\nis increasing thanks to chord estimation algorithms (see e.g.\n[13]) and user-generated data (which is readily available from\nthe web), few efforts have been put on harmony-based sim-\nilarity measures.\nOn the other hand, human listeners, due to their musical\nbackground, are more susceptible to like songs with a fa-\nmiliar harmonic structure, but yet different enough from the\nsongs they already know [14]1. We believe, thus, that com-\nparing songs thanks to their harmonic motifs would yield\nin a similarity measure that takes into account its repetitive\nharmonic sub-structures.\nOne efÔ¨Åcient way for motif extraction is the use of graphs.\nMotif extraction on graphs has attracted a lot of attention\nin the past years, e.g. in community detection [1], or in\ngraph comparison [10]. A motif is formally deÔ¨Åned in [1] as\na connected undirected sub-graph (or weakly connected di-\nrected sub-graph) which appears frequently in a graph show-\ning some kind of structure. Examples of motifs are cliques,\npaths, cycles, or sub-trees. The method presented in this pa-\nper relies on the concept of cycle as a motif for similarity\ndetection between graphs (isomorphism). By transforming\nthe chord sequences into graphs, and comparing their simple\ncycles, we obtain a similarity measure based on the musical\nmotifs of a song (see Section 4.1 for a more precise descrip-\ntion). The contributions of our work are as follows:\n1. It is based on the repetitive harmonic features of\nsongs (which can be easily extracted from web re-\nsources, as done in the present work).\n2. The similarity measure deals with large structural\n1This is explained by [12] as ‚Äòthe compromise between the repetition\nand the surprise‚Äù in the expectation of a human listener.\n61Poster Session 1\nchanges in chord progression (e.g., addition of repe-\ntitions, bridge, etc.).\n3. The similarity matrix can be extracted by means of\nkernel functions .\n4. The similarity is transposition invariant (the inter-\nvals between chords are used, instead of the chords\nthemselves).\n5. We provide a simple, general, methodology for com-\nputing similarities from chord progressions (from the\ntext mining step to acquire the data, to the automatic\nclassiÔ¨Åcation step with an SVM).\n6. We exploit a novel source of user-generated data\nthat is readily available on the Internet (in form of gui-\ntar chord progressions).\n7. Empirical tests show that music similarity retrieval\ncan be performed solely on the basis of chords.\nWe will brieÔ¨Çy review the related work about chord se-\nquence similarity in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the\ncyclic pattern kernels, on which our method is based. The\ndetails of our algorithm can be found in Section 4, as well\nas the graph extraction technique. Empirical testing is pre-\nsented on two music retrieval tasks in Section 5, and even-\ntually, Section 6 presents our conclusions.\n2. RELATED WORK\nHarmonic similarity has recently attracted the attention of\nthe MIR (Music Information Retrieval) community thanks\nto the improvement in chord estimation techniques [13], as\nwell as the increase of the available data. One of the ad-\nvantages of harmonic similarity is its ability to infer similar\nsongs whose melodies differ. In this context, [4] proposes an\napproach based on the Tonal Pitch Space (TPS) which com-\npares the change of chordal distance to the tonic over time.\nThis local distance is then used to build a step function that\ncomputes the global distance between two chord progres-\nsions by minimizing the non-overlapping area of the two\nstep functions. However, this method requires information\nabout the key of the piece and does not support structural\nchanges (e.g., introduction of repetitions).\nWe can also Ô¨Ånd techniques based on approximate string\nmatching, such as the one proposed by [9]. This technique\nextracts the most similar regions of the two chord sequences,\nand computes a distance based on the number of simple op-\nerations (insertion, deletion, substitution) that are needed to\ntransform the Ô¨Årst region into the second. This algorithm\nhas complexity O(nm)wherenandmare the length of the\nsequences to compare, and edition costs must be provided.\nGenerative models are the third type of harmony similar-\nity techniques. Such models assume that harmony variationsoccur according to an underlying model. The authors of [15]\npropose to model chord transitions of a song by means of\nanth-order Markovian model, which serves as basis for\na Kullback-Leibler scoring function. A generative model\nbased on linguistics has also been applied in [3]. This har-\nmony similarity method is based on the assumption of a gen-\nerative grammar of tonal harmony. By applying a weighted\nversion of this grammar, a unique parse tree representing the\nchord sequence is obtained for each song ‚Äì note that context\nfree grammars produce multiple ambiguous parse trees, thus\na weighting of the rules is needed to choose among all possi-\nbilities. In order to measure the similarity of a pair of parse\ntrees, the largest embeddable tree is extracted. However,\nits time complexity is O(min(n,m)nm)and this technique\nmay reject a sequence which is considered as ungrammati-\ncal.\n3. CYCLIC PATTERNS KERNEL\nCyclic patterns represent harmonic motifs in chord progres-\nsions. In order to extract these motifs for music similarity,\nwe will rely upon the cyclic pattern kernels from [10]. In\nthis section we will present the key concepts of this tech-\nnique which computes a kernel based on the set of cyclic\nand tree patterns of a graph.\n3.1 Graphs and cycles\nLet us Ô¨Årst give some deÔ¨Ånitions concerning graphs and cy-\ncles. LetG= (V,E,label )be a directed graph deÔ¨Åned as\na Ô¨Ånite set of vertices V, edgesE‚äÜ[V]2, and their labels.\nThe cardinalities of VandEarenandm, respectively.

Although a cycle may have several permutations,\nonly one of them (and the same in all cases) will be kept for\nour purposes. We can now deÔ¨Åne the set S(G)as the set of\nsimple cycles of G, the set of unrestricted cyclic patterns as\nC(G), and its relation:\nS(G)‚äÇC(G) (2)\nSimilarly, we can deÔ¨Åne the set of tree patterns ,T(G), as:\nT(G) ={Tis a connected component of B(G)} (3)\nwhereBis the set of bridges of G(see [10] for more details).\n3.2 Kernel methods\nThe method presented in this paper belongs to the family of\nkernel methods [7, 17], a well-founded technique in statisti-\ncal learning which comprises three steps:\n6212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n1. A mappingœÜof the data from the input space, x, (di-\nrected labeled graphs G, in our case) into some mean-\ningful, application-dependent, feature space, F, (sim-\nple cycles):\nœÜ:x‚ÜíœÜ(x)‚ààF (4)\n2. An inner product deÔ¨Åned in the feature space, œÜ(x),\nin order to obtain the kernel matrix (a positive deÔ¨Ånite\nmatrix of similarities):\nk(x,y) =/angbracketleftœÜ(x),œÜ(y)/angbracketright (5)\n3. A learning algorithm for discovering patterns in that\nspace (in our case, an RBF SVM for the automatic\nclassiÔ¨Åcation based on the similarity matrix).\nOne interesting property of kernel functions is that, although\nthe feature space may have inÔ¨Ånite dimension (the number\nof possible cycles, in our case), it is often possible to com-\npute them in polynomial time. The obtained kernel matrix\ncan then be used as a similarity matrix for music retrieval\ntasks.\n3.3 Cyclic patterns kernel function\nA cyclic patterns kernel function is proposed by [10], which\ntakes two graphs as input, extracts their cyclic C(G)and tree\npatternsT(G)and uses them to build a mapping Œ¶CP(G)\ninto the feature space:\nŒ¶CP(G) =C(G)‚à™T(G) (6)\nThecyclic pattern kernel is deÔ¨Åned as the set of all simple\ncycles and tree patterns that appear in both graphs:\nkCP(Gi,Gj) =|C(Gi)‚à©C(Gj)|+|T(Gi)‚à©T(Gj)|(7)\nHowever, the problem of computing cyclic pattern kernels\nisNP-hard. For overcoming this issue, the authors in [10],\nrestrict the set of cyclic patterns to S(G), so that only sim-\nple cycles are computed (those cycles whose only repeated\nnodes are the Ô¨Årst and the last one). The advantage of sim-\nple cycles is that they can be computed in polynomial time.\nThe authors use the algorithm from [16], which extracts the\nsimple cycles of a graph by means of a depth-Ô¨Årst search in\ntimeO(n+m(c+1)) , wherenis the number of vertices, m\nis the number of edges, and cis the number of simple cycles.\nIt is important, thus, that there exists a bound ( well-behaved\ndata) on the number of simple cycles for the sake of efÔ¨Å-\nciency of the algorithm. As empirically shown in Section 5\n(see Figure 2), this is the case for our chord data.\n4. PROPOSED SIMPLE-CYCLE\nWEIGHTED KERNEL\nIn this section we present the proposed kernel, which is a\nvariant of the cyclic pattern kernels [10] introduced in theprevious section. We propose to focus our kernel only on\nsimple cycles which will represent the repetitive harmonic\nsub-structure of a song. In order to favor longer simple cy-\ncles, a weighted (normalized) version of the kernel will be\ncomputed.\n4.1 Graph extraction\nChord sequences represent the harmonic progression of a\nsong which may modulate over time, i.e., its key changes\nthrough time. This is an important issue for the detection of\nharmonic similarities, as the transposed chords may not co-\nincide. In order to make our method transposition-invariant\nwe will thus convert the chord sequence into interval se-\nquences, from which input graphs will be extracted. As\nonly structure matters for us, and not the ‚Äúmusical distance‚Äù\nbetween a pair of chords (in semitones), a label Œªiwill be\nassigned to each chord transition with the same ‚Äúmusical\ndistance‚Äù (key invariant)2 3. For example, the transition\nC‚ÜíD#mwill share the same label as F‚ÜíG#mand\nits enharmonic C‚ÜíE/flatm , i.e.,\n(C,D#m) = (C,E/flatm ) = (F,G#m) =Œªk (8)\nChords C,G,Am,F,C,G,F,C,G,Am,C,G,F,C,G,Am,...\nLabels (C,G ) = (F,C ) =Œª1,(G,Am ) =Œª2\n(Am,F ) =Œª3,(G,F ) =Œª4,(Am,C ) =Œª5\nIntervals Œª1,Œª2,Œª3,Œª1,Œª1,Œª4,Œª1,Œª2,Œª5,Œª1,Œª4,Œª1,...\nGraph\nTable 1 . Transformation of an extract of the chord progres-\nsion of ‚ÄúLet it be‚Äù from The Beatles into an interval graph.\nBy sequentially reading the obtained interval sequence\nx={Œª1,Œª2,...,Œª 1,...,Œª l}, we will extract a directed graph\nG(see Table 1) where each node represents a chord transi-\ntion or interval ( n=|{Œªi}|), and each interval transition is\nrepresented by an edge ( m=|{Œªi‚ÜíŒªj}|).\n2For the sake of consistency we have not made the distinction between\nascending or descending intervals.\n3Please note that the chord type (minor, major, diminished, etc.) is\nalready incorporated in the graph representation through the Œªvalues, e.g.,\n(Cdim,Am ) = (Edim,C #m) =Œªk.\n63Poster Session 1\nFigure 1 . Computation of the simple-cycles weighted kernel on two initial graphs, G1andG2.\n4.2 Kernel function\nBased on the algorithm from [10], we build a kernel which\ntakes any two interval graphs from the input space, extracts\ntheir simple cycles to build a feature space, and computes a\nsimilarity as the weighted inner product in the feature space.\nIn our case, the mapping function Œ¶is deÔ¨Åned as a mapping\nto the set of all possible simple cycles of the graph\nG‚ÜíŒ¶SC(G) =S(G) (9)\nwhich represent the repetitive sub-structures of an interval\ngraph. For a particular graph Gj, its feature vector has en-\ntries[œÜ(Gj)]iwhich are equal to 1 if the simple cycle with\nindexi(denoted as cycle iin the sequel) is present in the\ngraph and 0 otherwise. We then compute the kernel func-\ntion as the weighted inner product between the feature vec-\ntors (simple cycles vector)\nk(x,y) =/angbracketleftœÜ(x),œÜ(y)/angbracketrightÀúW=œÜ(x)TDœÜ(y) (10)\nwhereDis the normalized diagonal weight matrix\n[D]ii=dii=wi/summationtext\nj‚ààS(Gk)‚à™S(Gl)wj(11)\nandwiis the length of the i-th cycle. The motivation for\nthis weighting is to favor longer cycles, so that two graphs\nsharing a long cycle are considered as more similar as two\ngraphs sharing one short cycle. Furthermore, the kernel\nweights are normalized by dividing them by their sum. The\ncomplete procedure is described in Algorithm 1 and an ex-\nample on how to compute the weighted kernel is given in\nFigure 1.\n5. EMPIRICAL TESTING\nTo evaluate empirically the retrieval performance of our ker-\nnel, two different tasks will be evaluated: (i) a cover song\nretrieval task, and (ii) an idiom retrieval task. We will Ô¨Årst\npresent the data used in the experiments, as well as the cho-\nsen lexicon.

Although our Ô¨Årst source of chord progressions\nhas already been used in MIR, we are the Ô¨Årst to use, to\nthe best of our knowledge, a popular Internet guitar‚Äôs chord\n4isophonics.net\n5www.ultimate-guitar.com\n6412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndata base for similarity retrieval. The Ultimate-Guitar data\nbase contains more than 250,000 user-generated sequences\nof guitar‚Äôs chords of popular pop/rock music. Although sev-\neral versions are available for each of the Beatles‚Äô songs,\nonly well-ranked songs have been extracted (5 star rated\nsongs with at least 5 votes), making a total of 71 songs.\nThese same songs have been extracted afterwards from the\nIsophonics data base, forming 71 classes of two songs each\n(142 songs in total), where the songs from the Isophonics\ndata base are used as query over the remaining 71 songs\nfrom the Ultimate-Guitar data base (one relevant song per\nquery). Although there exists a well-known MIREX audio\ncover song task, this evaluation task takes audio signals as\ninput while our work is centered on chords, so that it cannot\nbe applied here.\nTheidiom data set has been fully extracted from the Ultimate-\nGuitar data base and contains 296 songs partitioned in two\nclasses (101 songs for the Ô¨Årst class, sharing a common 4-\nchords idiom6, and 195 songs for the second class). Both\ndata sets are available from www.isys.ucl.ac.be/staff/\nsilvia/research.htm .\nIn both cases, a modest lexicon containing all major and\nminor root chords (Ô¨Çat and sharp) has been used. We be-\nlieve that this choice is representative enough for our pur-\npose, while avoiding bad transcription issues from users in\nthe Ultimate-Guitar data base, e.g., the chord C5appears\ninstead ofC.\n5.2 Cover song retrieval task\nCover song retrieval (see for instance [2]) is a popular task in\nMIR which aims at identifying the versions of a given song.\nFor this purpose, the cover song data set described above\nhas been used. We query the Ultimate-Guitar database with\neach song from the Isophonics chord annotation (the ‚Äùquery\nsong‚Äù), providing a ranking of the Ultimate-Guitar songs\nin decreasing order of similarity with the Isophonics query\nsong (please see Section 5.1 for more details). The average\nranking position of all retrieved songs, as well as two recall\nmeasures describing the accuracy of our method have been\nreported in Table 2: the average Ô¨Årst tier (the number of\ncorrectly retrieved songs among the best (nc‚àí1)matches\ndivided by (nc‚àí1)withncthe class size, i.e., in our case\nnc= 2), and the average second tier (number of correctly\nretrieved songs among the best (2nc‚àí1)matches divided\nby(nc‚àí1)).\nIn order to compare our method to other base line meth-\nods, the same methodology7has been applied to three string\nmatching techniques ‚Äì the edit distance and longest com-\n6The sequence ‚ÄúC,G,Am,F‚Äù is considered as an idiom in modern\npop/rock composition.

For methods\nneeding a parameter, the fast sub-tree kernel and the simple-\ncycles kernel, we have chosen a maximum cycle length (tree\ndepth) of 7 ‚Äì longer cycles or deeper trees become too song-\nspeciÔ¨Åc, and are not of interest for us. Although chosen base\nline methods may appear simplistic, our aim is to compare\nour algorithm with a variety of methods under the same con-\nditions. Purpose-built methods using different chord repre-\nsentations, or needing parameter tuning are not compared in\nthe present article for obvious reasons of adaptation, leaving\nthis task for further work.\nAlthough results show no improvement for the Ô¨Årst tier,\nand just a slight improvement of the second tier (see average\nÔ¨Årst and second tier in Table 2) from the base line methods,\nthere is a clear improvement in the average general ranking\nof retrieved songs. These results are encouraging for using\nthe Ultimate-Guitar data base as a future source for chord\nprogression data.\n5.3 Idiom retrieval task\nIdioms have recently attracted the attention of MIR as a new\nobject of musicological interest. An idiom is deÔ¨Åned in [11]\nas a ‚Äúprominent chord sequence in a particular style, genre\nor historical period‚Äù. Users have also discovered this notion\nof idiom as shown in a youtube video8, where a sequence of\n4 chords is used to assemble the melody of several pop/rock\nsongs. Interestingly, people who liked a few of these songs\ntended to also appreciate the others.\nWe have tried to recover the songs containing the idiom\n‚ÄúC,G,Am,F‚Äù (or ‚ÄúI-V-VI-IV‚Äù) by applying a 10-fold double\ncross validation with an RBF SVM on the idiom data set\nfrom the Ultimate-guitar web site. ClassiÔ¨Åcation rates with\na 95% conÔ¨Ådence interval are reported in Table 3. These\nresults show an increase of performance of our method of\n7% from the closest base-line method.\nSimilarity First tier Second tier Average\naverage average ranking\nEdit distance 78.87%¬±6.76 87.32%¬±5.51 4.169¬±1.64\nLongest common subs. 60.56%¬±8.10 69.01%¬±7.66 8.662¬±2.59\nAll-subsequence kernel 28.17%¬±7.45 43.66%¬±8.22 15.929¬±3.32\nFast sub-tree kernel 52.11%¬±8.27 61.97%¬±8.04 11.943¬±2.78\nSimple-cycles kernel 78.87%¬±6.76 88.73%¬±5.24 2.915¬±1.09\nTable 2 .

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper we have introduced a simple-cycle similarity\nmethod based on the harmonic progression of a song. We\nhave presented the notions of a theoretically well-founded\nmethod, and shown its applicability to our problem. This\napproach has furthermore been validated on an idiom and\na cover song retrieval task. The obtained results suggest\nthe utility of extracting repetitive sub-structures for music\nsimilarity purposes by means of a simple-cycles weighted\nkernel. Further work will try to improve the presented algo-\nrithm by performing an approximate cycle matching, and by\nreplacing labels by musical distances between chords.\n7.

Toward this goal, we have already de-\nveloped various active music listening interfaces [1], where\nactivemusiclisteningisawayoflisteningtomusicthrough\nactive interactions.

However,\nuptonowthegeneralpublichasnothadthechanceofusing\nsuchresearch-levelinterfacesandtechnologiesindailylife.\nWe therefore developed a web service called Songlethat\nallowsanonymouswebuserstoenjoymusicbyusingactive\nmusiclisteninginterfacesonawebbrowser. Songleusesau-\ntomatic music-understanding technologies to estimate mu-\nsic scene descriptions (musical elements) [3,4] of musical\npieces (audio Ô¨Åles) available on the web. A user of Songle\ncan enjoy playing back a musical piece while seeing the\nvisualization of the estimated descriptions. In our current\nimplementation, four major types of descriptions are auto-\nmatically estimated and visualized for content-based mu-\nsic browsing: music structure (chorus sections and repeated\nsections), hierarchical beat structure (musical beats and bar\nlines),melodyline(fundamentalfrequency(F0)ofthevocal\nmelody), and chords (root note and chord type). In partic-\nular, Songle implements all functions of the SmartMusicK-\nIOSK interface, and a user can jump and listen to the cho-\nrus with just a push of the next-chorus button. Songle thus\nmakesit easier for a user to Ô¨Ånd desired parts of a piece.\nGiventhevarietyofmusicalpiecesontheweb,however,\nit is difÔ¨Åcult to estimate music scene descriptions with high\naccuracy. Because of the diversity of music genres, com-\nplexity of sound mixtures, and recording conditions, auto-\nmatic music-understanding technologies cannot avoid mak-\ningsomeerrors,eventhoughthetechnologiesareconstantly\nimproving. As a result, users of such a web service might\nbe disappointed by its performance.\nTo overcome this difÔ¨Åculty, Songle enables anonymous\nusers to contribute by correcting music-understanding er-\nrors. Each user can see the music-understanding visualiza-\ntions on a web browser, with a moving cursor indicating\nthe audio playback position. If a user Ô¨Ånds an error while\nlistening, the user can easily correct the error by select-\ning from a list of candidates, or by providing an alternative\ndescription on Songle‚Äôs efÔ¨Åcient error correction interface.\nThe resulting corrections are then shared and used to im-\nmediately improve the user experience with the corrected\npiece.

Furthermore,\nwe hope to extend Songle so that it can serve as a research\nplatform able to support various music-understanding tech-\nnologies developedby differentresearchers.\n2. OVERVIEWOF SONGLE\nSongle is a social annotation web service where users can\nretrieve, browse, and annotate musical pieces on the web.\nFigure 1 shows the web page of the Songle interface after\na musical piece is selected. During the initial stage of the\nSongle launch we are focusing on popular songs with vo-\ncals. Songs recently released on music web services such\nas Magnatune (http://magnatune.com/) and PIAPRO1are\nadded (registered) to Songle. A user can also register any\nsongavailableonthewebbyprovidingtheURLofitsMP3\nÔ¨Åle, the URL of a web page including multiple MP3 URLs,\nor the URL of a music podcast (an RSS syndication feed\nincluding multiple MP3 URLs).\nEverybody can enjoy active music listening and correct\nerrors as an anonymous user without logging in, but a user\nhas to log in with OpenID to register a new song. In addi-\n1PIAPRO (http://piapro.jp/) is a web service to which musicians can\nupload their ownsongs created using singing synthesizers.tion,alogged-inusercangenerateaplaylist. Suchaplaylist\nhas a title (theme) and the user can choose whether to share\nit with other users. A logged-in user can also enter and\nrecordapreference(likeordislike)foreachsongtogetbet-\nter song recommendations in the future.\nSongle supports three main functions: retrieving, brows-\ning,andannotatingsongs. Theretrievalandbrowsingfunc-\ntionsfacilitatedeeperunderstandingofmusic,andtheanno-\ntation (error correction) function allows users to contribute\nto improve music scene descriptions. These improved de-\nscriptions can then lead to a better user experience of re-\ntrievingand browsingsongs.\n2.1 RetrievalFunction\nThis is a function that enables a user to retrieve a song\nthrough a text search of the song title or artist name, or\nthrough selection from a list of artists or a list of songs\nwhose descriptions were recently estimated or corrected.\nThis function also shows various kinds of ranking, such as\nartist ranking, song ranking, and user ranking (by the num-\nber of corrected errors).\nFollowingtheideaoftheactivemusiclisteninginterface\nVocalFinder [5], which Ô¨Ånds songs with similar vocal tim-\nbres, a similarity graph of songs is also visualized so that\na user can retrieve a song according to vocal timbre simi-\nlarity. The graph is a radially-connected network in which\nnodes (songs) of similar vocal timbre are connected to the\ncenter node (a recommended or user-speciÔ¨Åed song). By\ntraversingagraphwhilelisteningtonodes,ausercanÔ¨Ånda\nsong havingthe favoritevocaltimbre.\nA user can play back a song in any list of songs (e.g.,\nplaylist, retrieved list, and ranking) for trial listening to\njudgewhetheritisofinterest. Byselectingoneofthesongs,\nthe user switches over to the next browsing function. While\nusing the browsing function, songs in the playlist are au-\ntomatically switched one after another if a user selects and\nlistens to a playlist.\n2.2 Within-songBrowsingFunction\nThis is a function that provides a content-based playback-\ncontrol interface for within-song browsing as shown in the\nupperhalfofFigure 1. Theupperwindowistheglobalview\nshowing the entire song and the lower window is the local\nviewmagnifying the selected region.\nWith this function, a user can view the following four\ntypes of music scene descriptions estimated automatically:\n1.Music structure(chorussections and repeatedsections)\nIn the global view, the music map of the SmartMusicK-\nIOSK interface [2] is shown below the playback controls\nincluding the buttons, time display, and playback slider.\nThe music map is a graphical representation of the entire\nsong structure consisting of chorus sections (the top row)\nand repeated sections (the Ô¨Åve lower rows). On each row,\ncolored sections indicate similar (repeated) sections. This\nmap helps a user decide where to jump.

It is also shown\nin the lower half of the global view. For simplicity, the\nfundamental frequency (F0) can be visualized after being\nquantizedto the closest semitone.\n4.Chords(rootnote and chordtype)\nChord names are written in the text at the top of the local\nview. Twelve different colors are used to represent twelve\ndifferent root notes so that a user can notice the repetition\nofchord progressions.\nIn the lower half of Figure 1, a user can add and share\nsocialtagsandtime-synchronouscommentsfor CrowdMu-\nsic Listening [6]. Clicking on a time-synchronous comment\nstarts playback from that position.\n2.3 Annotation (ErrorCorrection)Function\nThis function allows users to add annotations to correct any\nestimation errors they may come across while listening tomusic. Here, annotation means describing the contents of a\nsong, either by modifying the estimated descriptions or by\nselectingthecorrectcandidateifavailable. Forthispurpose,\nwe provide an efÔ¨Åcient error correction interface (editor) as\nshownin Figure 2.\nEditorsforfourtypesofmusicscenedescriptionscanbe\nswitched between in the local view.\n1.Music structure (Figure2(a))\nThe beginning and end points of every chorus or repeated\nsection can be adjusted.

Each chord\nboundarycanalsobeadjusted. Chordscanbeplayedback\nalong with the original song to make it easier to check the\ncorrectness.\nNote that users can simply enjoy active music listening\nwithout correcting errors. We understand that it is too difÔ¨Å-\ncult for some users to correct the above descriptions (espe-\ncially, chords). Designing an interface that makes it easier\nfor them to correct will be another future challenge. More-\nover, users are not expected to correct all errors, only some\naccording to each user‚Äôsinterests.\nWhen the music-understanding results are corrected by\nusers, the original values are visualized as trails with dif-\nferent colors (white, gray, or yellow marks in Figure 2)\nthat can be distinguished by anybody. These trails\nare important to prevent overestimation of the automatic\nmusic-understandingperformanceaftertheusercorrections.\nMoreover, all the correction histories are recorded, and de-\nscriptions before and after corrections can be compared.\n3. IMPLEMENTATIONOF SONGLE\nThe implementation overview of Songle is shown in\nFigure 3. The web crawler collects musical pieces (MP3\nÔ¨Åles) on the basis of their URLs and RSS feeds, which can\nbe added by users, and stores the pieces in the database.\nSeveralmusic-understanding modules , each corresponding\nto a particular type of music scene description, then pro-\ncesseachmusicalpiece. Forexample,thebeatstructureand\nthe music structure are estimated by two different modules.\nWhen a request from an idle music-understanding module\nis received by the music-understanding manager , the next\navailable musical piece lacking an estimation result for the\ncorresponding description is handed over. After the music-\nunderstanding module Ô¨Ånishes processing its piece, the es-\ntimation result is passed to the database manager via the\nmusic-understanding manager. The database manager con-\ntrols the processing state of the musical pieces and stores\ntheir estimation results in a database together with the cor-\nrections when provided by users. Finally, the web serverworks as a website that provides the Songle user interface ,\nwhich directly plays back the MP3 Ô¨Åle from the original\nURL.\nThe web server of Songle was implemented by using a\nweb application framework Ruby on Rails , a programming\nlanguage Ruby, a web server Passenger andApache, and a\ndatabaseMySQL.Theclientuserinterfacewasimplemented\nby using a scripting language ActionScript 3 , an Action-\nScript3compiler AdobeFlexCompiler ,andascriptinglan-\nguageJavaScript .\nMusicscene descriptions are estimated as follows.\n1.Music structure\nChorussectionsandrepeatedsectionsareestimatedbyus-\ningthechorus-sectiondetectionmethod RefraiD[2]which\nfocuses on popular music. By analyzing relationships be-\ntween various repeated sections, the RefraiD method can\ndetect all the chorus sections in a song and estimate both\nends of each section. It can also detect modulated chorus\nsections.\n2.Hierarchicalbeat structure\nThe beats are estimated using a hidden Markov model\n(HMM) with 43 tempo states, each having 18 to 60 sub-\nstates corresponding to the beat phase of different tempi.\nIn each tempo a beat is modeled as a left-to-right HMM\nin which only some states have non-deterministic transi-\ntion probabilities to allow for tempo Ô¨Çuctuations or tempo\nchanges. The emission probability of a sub-state is calcu-\nlated via the cosine similarity between a comb Ô¨Ålter and a\nsimple onset detection function. Five different comb-Ô¨Ålter\nshapes are used to output Ô¨Åve different beat-tracking re-\nsults, including those that are likely true candidates if the\ndefaultalgorithmtrackstheback-beatorbeatsattwicethe\ntrue tempo. This strategy maximizes the likelihood of of-\nferingthe beat-tracking result desired by the user.\nThebarlinesareestimatedusingharmoniccues. First,we\nextract tatum-synchronous bass and treble chromagrams\nusing NNLS Chroma [7]. We build a simple chord detec-\ntion model and calculate posterior probabilities of chord\nchanges. Using a sliding window, we compute the cosine\nsimilaritybetweenthechordchangeprobabilitiesandsev-\neral different bar patterns that cover the 3/4, 4/4 and 6/8\nmeters and all possible bar phases. We normalize the co-\nsine similarities at each frame and use them as emissions\ninanother HMM similar to the beat-tracking model.\n3.Melody line\nThe fundamental frequency (F0) of the vocal part is es-\ntimated by using the F0 estimation method for the vo-\ncal melody [8], which is implemented by extending the\npredominant-F0 estimation method PreFEst [4]. This\nmethod focuses only on the vocal melody by evaluating a\nGMM-based vocal probability for each F0 candidate esti-\nmated by PreFEst. Moreover, vocal activity detection was\nimplementedby using a method described in [9].\n4.Chords\nWe transcribe chords using 14 chord types: major, ma-\njor 6th, major 7th, dominant 7th, minor, minor 7th, half-\n31412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndiminished, diminished, augmented, and Ô¨Åve variants of\nmajor chords with different bass notes: /2, /3, /5, /b7, and\n/7. The resulting 14 types √ó12 root notes = 168 chords\nand one ‚Äòno chord‚Äô label are estimated using an HMM ap-\nproach on the same tatum-synchronous chromagram used\nfor the bar-line estimation. Chord changes are allowed to\nhappenonly on beats.\nWe also include knowledge from the bar-line estimation\nand a key estimate. Instead of building one large model\nin which chords and keys are modeled simultaneously\n(e.g. [10]), we chose a less memory-intensive, progressive\napproach. First, we model the key in a simple separate\nHMM with three different key scales: major, natural mi-\nnor, and harmonic minor. Every key state has observation\nprobabilities for all different chords, based on an expert\nfunction [10]. The posterior probability obtained from the\nHMMisthenusedtoweightthechordprobabilitiesforthe\nchord HMM. During Viterbi decoding we use the bar-line\nestimates for dynamic transition probability weighting in\norderto encourage chord changes at bar lines.\nTo show the similarity graph of songs, the vocal timbre\nsimilarity between songs is calculated by using the method\nused in VocalFinder [5]. The current recommendation of\nsongs simply uses the same similarity, which shall be im-\nprovedin the future.\n4. DISCUSSION\nWhile research dealing with a public web service for active\nmusic listening and social annotation has not been pursued\nin the past, there have been various approaches related to\nmusic annotation. In the following, we introduce related\nwork and then discuss how Songle could contribute to soci-\nety and academic research.\n4.1 Related Research\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to collect a large\namount of ground-truth annotations. Such annotations\nare useful for improving the accuracy of music informa-\ntion retrieval (MIR) systems using machine learning tech-\nniques, and for evaluating MIR systems [11]. For exam-\nple,Lee[12]usedawebservicecalledAmazonMechanical\nTurk (MTurk) to ask people to make similarity judgments.\nMandeletal.[13]alsousedMTurkfortagcollection. These\napproaches showed that the quality of the collected anno-\ntations was sufÔ¨Åciently high. However, the human effort\nnecessary increases in proportion to the required number of\nannotations.\nTo solve this problem, it is interesting to let non-experts\ncontributetomakingground-truthannotations. Onepromis-\ning approach is based on games. For example, Turnbull et\nal.[14,15]proposedanannotationgame,whereplayersare\nasked to choose the most and least suitable descriptions for\na given musical piece. Mandel and Ellis [16] proposed an-\notherannotationgame,whereplayerscangetpointsbypro-\nviding useful descriptions that were not provided by other\nplayers. Law et al.[17] proposed another annotation gamebasedontheESPGame[18]inwhichplayersarenotasked\nto describe a sound, but told to guess what their randomly\npairedpartnersarethinking. Songleprovidesastrongermo-\ntivationforuserstocontributethantheserelatedapproaches\nbecause the user is awareof improving the service for other\nusers.\nTo annotate musical pieces, various useful editors have\nbeendeveloped,suchasSonicVisualiser[19],Audacityex-\ntension [20], CLAM [21], and MUCOSA [22]. The Echo\nNest API (http://developer.echonest.com/) is also useful for\naccesstovariousannotations. SongleistheÔ¨Årstsystemthat\nallows anonymous users to collaborate to edit various mu-\nsic scene descriptions (chorus, beats, melody, and chords)\ndirectly on the web without stand-alone applications.\n4.2 Contributionsof Songle\nSongle makes a social contribution by providing the\nworld‚Äôs Ô¨Årst public web service for enjoying active mu-\nsic listening interfaces with music-understanding technolo-\ngies. It also promotes the popularization and use of\nmusic-understanding technologies by raising user aware-\nness. Users can grasp the nature of music-understanding\ntechnologies just by seeing results of the technologies ap-\nplied to songs available on the web. When there are many\nerrors, we run the risk of attracting criticism, but we be-\nlieve that sharing these results with users will promote fur-\nther popularization of this research Ô¨Åeld.\nThe academic contribution of this study is to propose a\nnewresearchapproachtomusicunderstandingbasedonsig-\nnal processing; this approach aims at improving both the\nmusic-understanding performance and the usage rate while\nbeneÔ¨Åting from the cooperation of anonymous end users.\nThisapproachisdesignedtosetintomotiona positivespiral\nwhere (1) we enable users to experience a service based on\nmusicunderstandingtoletthembetterunderstanditsperfor-\nmance, (2) users contribute to improved performance, and\n(3) the improved performance leads to a better user expe-\nrience, which encourages further use of the service at step\n(1) of this spiral. This is a social correction framework,\nwhere users can improve the performance by sharing their\ncorrection results over a web service. The game-based ap-\nproach of Human Computation or GWAPs (games with a\npurpose) [23] like the ESP Game [18] often lacks step (3)\nand depends on the feeling of fun. In this framework, users\ngain a real sense of contributing for their own beneÔ¨Åt and\nthat of others and can be further motivated to contribute by\nseeing corrections made by other users. In this way, we can\nusethewisdomofcrowds orcrowdsourcing toachieveabet-\nter user experience.\nAnother important technical contribution of this study\nis to investigate how far the performance of music-\nunderstanding technologies can be improved by getting er-\nrors corrected through the cooperative efforts of users. Al-\nthough we have not yet implemented a machine-learning\nmechanismtoimprovetheperformanceonthebasisofuser\ncorrections,wecouldimplementsuchamechanismoncewe\n315Oral Session 4: Web\nhavecollectedenoughcorrections. Thisstudywillthenpro-\nvide a framework for amplifying user contributions in mu-\nsic research. In a typical Web 2.0service like Wikipedia ,\nimprovements are limited to an item directly contributed\n(edited) by users. In Songle, improvements will automat-\nically spread to other songs because of the improvement\nof the music-understanding technologies through machine\nlearningtechniques. Thiswillbeanoveltechnologyofam-\nplifyingusercontributions,whichcouldbebeyondWeb2.0\nand Human Computation [23]. We hope that this study will\nshowtheimportanceandpotentialofincorporatingandam-\nplifying user contributions in music research, as have been\ndemonstrated by PodCastle in speech research [24,25].\nWe think we can trust users with respect to the quality\nof correction according to our experiences from PodCas-\ntle[25]. Evenifsomeusersdeliberatelymakeinappropriate\ncorrections (the vandalism problem), we will be able to de-\nvelop countermeasures to acoustically evaluate the reliabil-\nity of corrections. For example, we could validate whether\nthecorrecteddescriptionscanbesupportedbyacousticphe-\nnomena. This will be another interesting topic of research.\n4.3 Songle as a ResearchPlatform\nIn the future, we hope to extend Songle to serve as a re-\nsearchplatformwhereotherresearcherscanalsoexhibitre-\nsults of their own music-understanding technologies. When\neach technology is implemented as a music-understanding\nmodulein Figure 3, which can be executed anywhere in the\nworld even in our current implementation, it is not neces-\nsary to share its source and binary codes. Each in-house\nmodule, even inside an Internet Ô¨Årewall, can just connect\nto themusic-understanding manager to receive an audio\nÔ¨Åle and send back music-understanding results via HTTP.\nTheresultsshouldalwaysbeshownwithclearacknowledg-\nments/credits so that users can distinguish the sources. We\nare also interested in adding other types of music scene de-\nscriptions, which are not yet supported.\nOnce this happens, it will be interesting to com-\npare/visualize differences of modules on each music scene\ndescription. Results from different researchers can also be\nusedascandidatesforthecorrectionandevenasvotestolet\ndifferentresults converge.\n5. CONCLUSION\nWehavedescribedSongle,anactivemusiclisteningservice\nthat is continually improved by user contributions. In our\ncurrent implementation, four types of music scene descrip-\ntionsareestimatedandexposedthroughweb-basedinterac-\ntive user interfaces. Since automatic music-understanding\ntechnologies are not perfect, Songle allows users to make\nerror corrections, which are shared with other users, thus\ncreating a positive spiral and an incentive to keep correct-\ning.

An original classiÔ¨Åcation scheme\nis devised using relevance feedback and active-learning seg-\nment selection in an interactive loop. Validation and correc-\ntion information given by the user is injected in the learning\nprocess at each iteration to achieve more accurate classiÔ¨Å-\ncation. An experimental study is conducted to evaluate and\ncompare the different classiÔ¨Åcation and relevance feedback\napproaches that are envisaged, using a database of poly-\nphonic pieces (with a varying degree of polyphony). The\nresults show that the different approaches are adapted to dif-\nferent applications and they achieve satisfying performance\nin a reasonable number of iterations.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nBeing composed directly with the ‚Äúsound material‚Äù using\nrecording techniques [18], electro-acoustic music differs from\nother more conventional musical forms. Composers of the\ngenre do not use score sheets to write music and there is\nno common agreement on a standard notation system to be\nused to create symbolic representations for such composi-\ntions. Electro-acoustic music is traditionally organized in\nsound objects . Here, we deÔ¨Åne ‚Äúsound object‚Äù as any sound\nevent perceived as a whole [18]. Most of the time a musi-\ncal piece does not expose separate sound objects as simul-\ntaneous sounds are masking each others due to polyphony.\nConsequently, the analysis of this music is quite complex\nand totally user-centered as it is essentially concerned with\nthe subjective identiÔ¨Åcation of sound objects of interest to\nthe user. The reader can refer to [1] for examples of electro-\nacoustic compositions.\nThis work presents an interactive classiÔ¨Åcation system\nfor electro-acoustic music analysis using relevance feedback.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.In previous works, relevance feedback has been widely used\nin content-based image retrieval tasks (see [4] for an overview).\nBy contrast, in the Ô¨Åeld of music information retrieval, rele-\nvance feedback and active learning have only been exploited\nin a few music information retrieval studies, for pop mu-\nsic retrieval based on user preferences [11] or mood/style\nclassiÔ¨Åcation [15]. More closely related works in this Ô¨Åeld\nhave focused on ‚Äústandard‚Äù instruments and percussion tim-\nbre classiÔ¨Åcation [7, 8, 14] by building supervised systems\nbased on large databases. In the electro-acoustic case, com-\nposers exploit various sound sources and one does not have\na-priori knowledge about these sources which are most of\nthe time polyphonic and heterogeneous.\nIn this paper, following our previous works [9, 10], we\npropose a complete system for electro-acoustic music anal-\nysis, and evaluate and compare different relevance feedback\napproaches to our problem. The initialisation of the sys-\ntem is achieved through an interactive segmentation phase\n(mostly similar to [9]) to obtain initial texture segments (see\nFigure 1 and 2). Then, these segments are processed by an\ninteractive classiÔ¨Åcation module using relevance feedback\nand active learning segment selection. From a user‚Äôs point\nof view, the search for a target sound object begins with the\nselection of a characteristic segment for each sound class.\nThen, the system enters in an interaction loop and suggests,\nat each iteration, segments to be annotated by the user so as\nto make learning progress. On each new proposed segment,\nthe user can correct the system‚Äôs label prediction. The inter-\naction loop ends when the user is satisÔ¨Åed with the labels.\nWe compare different classiÔ¨Åcation and relevance feedback\napproaches for different degrees of polyphonic complexity.\nThis study shows that different methods are more adapted to\ndifferent applications.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents\nthe musical motivations and the results of musicologists‚Äô in-\nterviews that were carried out to acquire prior knowledge\non their approach to the analysis of electro-acoustic mu-\nsic. Section 3 describes the interactive system including the\nuser interaction scenario and active learning segment selec-\ntion strategy. Section 4 is dedicated to the evaluation of the\nmethod and the last section suggests some conclusions.\n145Poster Session 1\n2. MUSICAL MOTIV ATIONS\nOur work attempts to address musicologists‚Äôs need for new\ntools for the analysis of non written music. Thus, for a\nbetter understanding of their expectations, interviews were\nheld with three musicologists with a special expertise in\nelectro-acoustic music analysis. The questions were about\ntheir personal methodology for analysis and the utility of\ncomputer-based sound analysis tools to their work. By ana-\nlyzing their answers, some common habits can be identiÔ¨Åed\nin their methodologies. Of note is the fact that they always\nlisten to the whole piece from 4 to 10 times to locate promi-\nnent sound objects and build a viewpoint to begin the anal-\nysis. Another common habit is to listen to the same piece\nseveral times and focus on one sound category at each time.\nIn all the interviews, the musicologists approach the analy-\nsis as a sound object transcription task . For some of them,\nthe transcription helps forming a viewpoint of the piece be-\ning analysed, whereas the others already have one when they\nbegin the transcription. All the subjects mentioned that they\ndo not transcribe all sound objects of the piece but only those\nwhich are useful for their personal analysis viewpoint.\nFor the question about the utility of computer-based tools,\nthey expressed some wishes which are all related to the sound\nobject transcription . The Ô¨Årst was to locate the main sound\nobjects of the piece and help them verify their transcription.\nAnother important wish was to Ô¨Ånd all the instances of one\nsound object by giving a segment of the target sound to the\ntool. This function could also help them to discover sound\ninstances that they did not notice.\nThis work takes those musical motivations into account\nand proposes an interactive system for helping musicolo-\ngists in the transcription task.\n3. INTERACTIVE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nIn this section, we describe all the aspects of the system in-\ncluding the expression of the user point of view.\n3.1 Architecture\nFigure 2 (A) is a representation of a polyphonic piece which\ninvolves potential sound masking: the distinct sound lay-\ners are arranged in parallel timelines (one for each sound\nclass). The goal of the transcription is to mark the pres-\nence of all target sounds in the whole piece. The classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion operates on texture segments ,i.e.temporal fragments\nof homogeneous timbre (as shown with vertical red lines in\nFigure 2). The system architecture is divided in two dis-\ntinct parts: the initialisation and the interaction loop which\nperforms the classiÔ¨Åcation of the texture segments and asks\nfeedback from the user. We compare two different inter-\naction loop approaches in this work. The Ô¨Årst approach is\nmulti-pass : the interaction loop focuses on one sound class\nInitial SegmentsValidated SegmentsPredicted SegmentsAll SegmentsUser\nClassiÔ¨ÅerActive SelectionPredicted SegmentsValidated SegmentsPredicted Segments\nSelected Segment Validation RequestValidation/Correction\nInteractive LoopLearningClassiÔ¨Åer ParametersValidated SegmentsInter Onset Segments\nInteractive  Clustering\nOnset SegmentationSlider MoveSegment selectionSegment selectionInitialisationFigure 1 . Overview of the interactive system\nat each pass, following the habits of the musicologists who\nare used to listen to the same piece several times and fo-\ncus on one sound category for one listening (see Section 2).\nThe other approach is referred to as one-pass : the interac-\ntion loop considers all the sound objects simultaneously at\neach time and consequently the user feedback applies to all\nthe classes of interest.\nThe interactions of the user with the system can be sum-\nmarized as follows:\n1. Initialisation\n(a) The system starts with an interactive segmenta-\ntion phase. If the user is transcribing Nclasses,\nfor each class Cia characteristic segment Siis\nassociated with i‚àà{1...N}(see Figure 2). In\norder to obtain the initial characteristic segments\nof all the sound classes corresponding to the user‚Äôs\npoint of view, in this Ô¨Årst interaction phase, the\nuser moves a slider which controls the global\nsegmentation level until the most adapted seg-\nmentation is reached. Texture segments are cre-\nated from this segmentation.\n(b) The user selects a characteristic texture segment\nSifor each target sound class\n2. Interaction loop\n(a) The system learns from the validated segments\nand enters in the classiÔ¨Åcation process to auto-\n14612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nmatically predict labels for the remaining parts\nof the signal.\n(b) In order to improve the previous classiÔ¨Åcation,\nthe system selects a segment, based on the active\nlearning strategies described in Section 3.3.5, and\nasks feedback from the user. In the multi-pass\napproach, the system predicts the presence/absence\nof the current target class and the user validates\nor corrects the selected segments prediction. In\ntheone-pass approach, the user corrects the pres-\nence/absence prediction of all the target classes\nfor the selected segment.\n(c) In the multi-pass approach, one vs all classiÔ¨Å-\ncation and feedback ((a) and (b)) iterations pro-\nceed until the user is satisÔ¨Åed with the result for\nthe current class, before entering a new pass,\nthat is a new interaction loop, for the next classes,\nuntil all classes have been covered. In the one-\npass approach all classes are considered jointly\nfrom the very beginning of the interaction loop\nand the system iterates multi-class classiÔ¨Åcation\nand feedback until the user is satisÔ¨Åed with the\noverall prediction.\nFigure 2 . Time-line representation of a polyphonic piece\nwith 3 sound classes and the characteristic segments of the\ntarget classes. Though the distinct sound layers are here dis-\nplayed in parallel time lines (A), in real situations the user\ncan actually only see the Ô¨Ånal mix made by the composer\nthat appears as a single track (B). The initial user selection\nand subsequent validations are done by listening.\nA total of 217 feature coefÔ¨Åcients are extracted from 25\nclassic audio descriptors on 20 ms windows with 50% over-\nlap, to be used both for the initial segmentation and the sub-\nsequent classiÔ¨Åcation. The reader can refer to [6, 17] for a\ncomplete description of the features. All the feature vec-\ntors used and the corresponding dimensions are listed in the\nwebsite of the paper1. Feature extraction was performed\n1http://www.tsi.enst.fr/ Àúgulluni/ismir2k11/using the YAAFE software [16].\n3.2 Interactive Clustering\nThe goal of the clustering is to obtain a segmentation adapted\nto the users‚Äô point of view as described in the initialisation\nparagraph of section 3.1. The reader can refer to [9] for a\ndetailed explanation of the initial clustering. First, onset de-\ntection is performed and the resulting detection function is\nused to obtain inter-onset segments . Subsequently, a clus-\ntering is performed on the inter-onsets vectorsXjwith an\nagglomerative hierarchical approach to obtain texture seg-\nments. The number of target clusters of the algorithm is\ncontrolled by the user in the interface with a slider to obtain\nan adapted segmentation.\n3.3 ClassiÔ¨Åcation\nIn this system, the classiÔ¨Åcation task consists in detecting\nthe presence of given sound classes in every texture seg-\nment of the musical piece. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nclassiÔ¨Åers [2] with probabilistic outputs2are used in a ‚Äúone\nvs all‚Äù fashion. Three different methods are compared to\nobtain the Ô¨Ånal prediction: a multi-pass approach and two\nvariants of a one-pass approach.\n3.3.1 Feature Selection\nAfter the initialisation phase, a feature selection based on\nthe Fisher discriminant [5] is performed. The algorithm iter-\natively selects the attributes which maximize the Fisher dis-\ncriminant and the dbest features are kept to deÔ¨Åne the fea-\nture space for the target class. The parameter dwas exper-\nimentally determined using a separate database and a value\nofd= 10 has been found to be an appropriate trade-of be-\ntween performance and complexity. The goal of the selec-\ntion is to create a relevant descriptor for each sound class.\nAs this selection is part of the interaction loop , the sound\ndescriptors may evolve accordingly with the user feedback.\nThis method is adapted to our problem since we do not have\nprior knowledge on the sound sources.\n3.3.2 Multi-pass (MP)\nIn this approach, the Nsound classes are treated sequen-\ntially: the user tries to spot all occurrences of the current\nclassCibefore beginning the next class. This enables the\nuser to focus on one sound category at each time following\nthe habits described in Section 2. Therefore, the correspond-\ningfeedback is quite simple: the user validates/corrects the\npresence or absence of the current class for the segment\nselected by active learning (see 3.3.5). For the learning\nphase, positive samples are those which contain the target\nsound class and negative samples are those which do not.\nThis implies that the positive segments may be complex\n2we use the libSVM implementation [3].\n147Poster Session 1\nsound mixtures which contain other sounds. Using proba-\nbilistic SVMs, posterior probabilities p(Ci|Xk)are obtained\nfor each frame observation Xk.\n3.3.3 One-pass\nIn the one-pass approach, the classiÔ¨Åcation is carried out\nas in a ‚Äùstandard‚Äù multiclass problem, where all classes are\njointly taken into account. Consequently, the user tries to\ntranscribe all the sound classes at the same time and the cor-\nresponding feedback requested to the user is to validate/correct\nthe presence or absence of all the sound classes for the se-\nlected segment (see 3.3.5). Two classiÔ¨Åcation methods are\ncompared in this approach.\nThe Ô¨Årst one ( one-pass 1 ) uses the same classiÔ¨Åcation\nmethod as the MP approach: for Nsound classes, Nclas-\nsiÔ¨Åers are trained with positive samples being those which\ncontain the target sound class and negative samples being\nthose which do not.\nThe second method ( one-pass 2 ) differs in that it can in-\ntroduce new classes through the iterations by considering\ntexture classes deduced from the user‚Äôs feedback, i.e.for a\ngiven feedback iteration, if the user formulates that the cor-\nresponding selected segment contains more than one sound\nclass, say classes A and B, a new texture class is created, that\nis composed of the union of those classes ( i.e.A‚à™B), and\nthe corresponding classiÔ¨Åer trained. Hence MclassiÔ¨Åers are\nhere used in the polyphonic case, with N‚â§M‚â§2N.\n3.3.4 Segment-level predictions\nGiven the posterior probability p(Ci|Xk)of classCion each\nframe feature vector Xk,P(Ci|XkœÑ,...,XkœÑ+LœÑ‚àí1)(a seg-\nment-level probability) is computed for each texture seg-\nment obtained in the clustering phase. For this, the sum of\nall frame-level log probabilities is used. The probability on\ntheœÑthtexture segment of length LœÑis given by:\nP(Ci|XkœÑ,...,XkœÑ+LœÑ‚àí1) =/summationtextkœÑ+LœÑ‚àí1\nk=kœÑlogp(Ci|Xk).\nThen, the label of a texture segment is given by the maxi-\nmum probability criterion.\n3.3.5 Active learning for segment selection\nRelevance feedback has been widely used in multimedia In-\nformation Retrieval. The reader can refer to [12] for an\noverview. In the context of this work, our approach con-\nsists in gradually adding new segments validated by the user\nin the learning process. As a consequence, the labels pre-\ndicted for the other segments may evolve at each iteration\nof the algorithm. The process begins with a limited num-\nber of segments for training the classiÔ¨Åer and the training\nsegment dataset grows step by step as user-validated seg-\nments are injected. The goal of this approach is to obtain the\ncorrect labeling of samples in a reasonable number of iter-\nations. Active learning theory proposes sampling strategies\nwhich are used to select the segments to be user-validatedÔ¨Årst. The two interaction loop approaches use different sam-\npling strategies. The Multi-pass approach uses the most\nambiguous strategy: in the SVM classiÔ¨Åer, most ambigu-\nous samples are the closest to the hyperplane in the feature\nspace. This strategy is adapted to binary classiÔ¨Åcation prob-\nlems and was shown to give the best results in a previous\nstudy [10]. The one-pass approach uses the best versus sec-\nond best strategy which has been successfully used in image\nclassiÔ¨Åcation [13]. This strategy uses the difference between\nthe probabilities of the two classes having the highest esti-\nmated probability value which provides an estimation of the\nconfusion about class membership.\nFor each frame-level probability, we compute a score s(k)\nin accordance with the sampling strategy used. Given this\nscore, for each frame of audio, we obtain a score for each\ntexture segment by temporal integration, where the segment\nscore is the mean of the underlying frame scores: SœÑ=\n1/LœÑ/summationtextkœÑ+LœÑ‚àí1\nk=kœÑs(k)for theœÑthtexture segment. The tem-\nporal integration allows us to obtain a unique sampling strat-\negy score for each segment and to rank them. Therefore, the\nsegment which maximizes the score is selected by the sys-\ntem and a feedback request is sent to the user.\n4. EV ALUATION\nUser-based experiments are very time consuming and re-\nquire the creation of ground-truth annotation of numerous\nmusic pieces, which often turns out to be even more tricky,\nespecially as far as electro-acoustic music is concerned. In-\ndeed, there exists only a few annotations in this case which\nmix the description of sound objects with the annotators‚Äô\nsubjective interpretation of the pieces. As a result, to val-\nidate our method with a descent number of Ô¨Åles and eas-\nily compare the different parameters settings, we opted for\na user simulation with synthetic music pieces generation.\nNevertheless, much care has been taken in order to make this\nprocedure completely realistic as will be further explained\nhereafter.\n4.1 Synthetic pieces generation\nThe synthetic pieces generation process is similar to our pre-\nvious work. The reader can refer to [10] for a complete de-\nscription. 24 homogeneous sounds (hence 24 classes) of dif-\nferent lengths (from a second to a minute) were selected by\ncomposers of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales3(INA-\nGRM) for the generation process. 100 pieces of 2 minutes\ncontaining 5 different sound classes for each were gener-\nated. 5 versions of each piece were obtained by varying\nthe polyphonic degree from 1 to 5 ( i.e.500 synthetic sound\nÔ¨Åles). Consequently, the nthvariation of a given piece will\nhave a maximum number of nsounds playing simultane-\n3http://www.inagrm.com/\n14812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nously. In the generation process, 5 distinct sounds are se-\nlected randomly for a given piece and different instances of\neach sounds are concatenated/juxtaposed accordingly with\nthe polyphonic degree of the piece.\n4.2 User simulation\nIn this work, we exploit a user feedback simulator to facili-\ntate the evaluation. It is used both in the initialisation phase\nand in the interaction loop. For the initialisation, the slider\nposition controls the overall segmentation level of the piece\nand the user has to choose the position which best matches\nhis/her viewpoint assuming that the user will tend to try to\nmaximise the segmentation F-measure score. Hence, the lat-\nter is computed for all the slider positions, i.e.all possible\nlevels of the hierarchical clustering used for segmentation.\nThe F-measure is computed with a temporal precision win-\ndow of 0.5 s over the segmentation‚Äôs boundaries. The slider\nposition which maximizes the F-measure is used as the ini-\ntial segmentation level before entering the interaction loop .\nFor the selection of class initialisation segments Si, the seg-\nments in which the target sound class Ciis the loudest were\nselected. For each texture segment œÑwe compute an en-\nergy ratio:RCi,œÑ=ECi,œÑ//summationtext\nl/negationslash=iECl,œÑwhereECi,œÑis the\nroot mean square energy of the œÑthtexture segment for the\nclassCi.ECi,œÑ=/radicalBig\n1/LœÑ/summationtextkœÑ+LœÑ‚àí1\nk=kœÑx2\ni(k)withxithe\nsignal of the class Ci. For a given sound class Ci, the tex-\nture segment which maximizes the ratio RCiis selected as\nthe initialisation segment for Ci. In the interaction loop , the\nsuccessive interaction steps of the user with the system, ex-\nposed in Section 3.1 were simulated for the 500 sound Ô¨Åles\nof the whole corpus. In this work, for active learning seg-\nment selection, we Ô¨Ålter segments shorter than 0.5 s since\nthey could be misjudged by the user when asked for valida-\ntion, due to human perception limitations. A basic version\nof the function undo is also simulated: if an acceptable level\nof satisfaction (F-measure ‚â•0.85) is reached for a given\nclassCl, the results must not decrease in the next iterations.\nTherefore, if the results decrease, we suppose that the user\nwill use the undo function and lock the class Clto retain\nthe previous classiÔ¨Åer predictions and re-use them (without\nfurther updating) for the next iterations.\n4.3 Results\nWe monitored the behaviour of the F-measure scores for 500\npieces over the iterations of the algorithm with the differ-\nent interactive approaches. In the different methods, we Ô¨Åx\na maximum number of iterations of 30 since good results\nshould be obtained in a reasonable number of interactions.\nAs it was observed in our previous work [10], the re-\nsults decrease accordingly with the polyphonic complexity\nof the pieces. Figure 3 shows the F-measure results across\nthe iterations for a particular class with the MP approach\n5 10 15 200.50.550.60.650.70.750.80.850.90.951Fmeasure of an individual class (Polyphony = 4)\nIteration numberMPMPMP\nMPFigure 3 .

It is observed that good results can be ob-\ntained after 10 iterations with this reasonable polyphonic de-\ngree. Given the nature of this approach, which permits the\nuser to focus on one class for the whole process, the obtained\nnumber of iterations must be multiplied by the number of\n149Poster Session 1\nclasses to adress in the music piece.\nFigure 4 compares the one-pass approaches (OP1 and\nOP2) for a polyphonic degree of 2. The Figure 5 compares\nthe same approaches for a polyphonic degree of 4. The re-\nsults show that the method OP2 which introduces new mix-\nture classes with user feedback gives better results. These\napproaches are both considering all the classes of interest\nat the same time and we observe that they can reduce the\ntotal number of iterations comparing to the MP approach\nin which the user must repeat the process to address all the\nclasses. A satisfying median F-measure of 0.85 can be ob-\ntained in 20 iterations with OP2 for a whole piece.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have proposed two different interactive ap-\nproaches for helping the analysis of electro-acoustic music.\nIn the multi-pass approach, the user focuses on one sound\nclass at each time. In the one-pass approaches, the user\ngives a more informative feedback to treat all the classes\nof the Ô¨Åle simultaneously. The results show that the MP ap-\nproach is more adapted to a small number of classes: if the\nnumber of classes to transcribe is important, satisfying re-\nsults can be obtained in a smaller number of iterations with\nOP2 (the most effective one-pass approach).\nFuture works will focus on integrating the labeling infor-\nmations of the initial clustering. To validate the system with\nreal pieces, we will extend the evaluation to real users and\nwork on the design of an appropriate user interface.\n6.

This fascina-\ntion leads to opinions about the music pieces that reÔ¨Çects\npeople‚Äôs exposure and personal experience. This inherent\nbias of people towards music indicates that personal opin-\nionis inappropriate for deÔ¨Åning the quality of music and\nmusicians. This paper takes a holistic view of the prob-\nlem and delves into the understanding of the structure of\nBrazilian music rooted in Network Sciences. In this paper\nwe work with a large database of albums of Brazilian music\nand study the structure of collaborations between all the mu-\nsicians and composers. The collaboration is modelled as a\nsocial network of musicians and then analyzed from differ-\nent perspectives with the goal of describing what we call the\nstructure of that musical genre as well as provide a ranking\nof musicians and composers.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nBrazilian Music is admired worldwide due to its diversity\nand richness of sounds. The music from Brazil is in fact a\nconÔ¨Çuence of many different cultural inÔ¨Çuences [1, 2]. This\nprocess of globalization of the popular music of Brazil has\ncome to a full circle when other genres around the world\nstarted to incorporate Brazilian rhythms and refer to Brazil-\nian music as an inÔ¨Çuence to them. It is known that world\ngreats such as Miles Davis and Frank Sinatra, and more re-\ncently the likes of Pat Metheny and Bill Frisell (jazz gui-\ntarists), have been inÔ¨Çuenced by and even worked with many\nBrazilian musicians.\nWhen it comes to the arts, is hard to deÔ¨Åne a canon due\nto subjective opinions. For classical art, the use of networks\nhas improved our ability to understand the importance of\nmany works [13]. In popular art, the deÔ¨Ånition is a lit-\ntle harder because it could depend on many factors such as\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.sales, and playtime on the radio. However, this paper pro-\nposes to use techniques from networks sciences to model\nthe network of collaborations among musicians and derive\nfrom the social network a good ranking of musicians and\ncomposers in Brazilian music.\nMany Brazilian musicians are well-known to people in\nBrazil and respected for their body of work. In Brazilian\npopular music ( M¬¥usica Popular Brasileira in Portuguese)\n[11], hereafter referred to as MPB, names such as Tom Jo-\nbim, Chico Buarque, and Noel Rosa are likely to be fa-\nvorites. But does the social network of collaborations in\nBrazilian support the view of critics about musicians such\nas the ones mentioned above? What makes a person impor-\ntant to his art? This paper looks initially at collaborations\nbetween musicians from a point of view albums recorded.\nWe have build a dataset of Brazilian albums (CDs, LPs, etc)\nand created a network of musicians in where they are linked\nif they participated together in at least one album. We then\nrepeat the study with composers who are linked to one an-\nother if they wrote a song together. In both instances, the\nweight of the collaboration is given by how many times the\ncollaboration was repeated. The goal of the study is to im-\nprove the understanding of the structure of Brazilian music\nas well as to use networks for providing a ranking of musi-\ncians and composers in MPB.\n2. A BRIEF HISTORY OF BRAZILIAN MUSIC\nBrazil is a country of continental proportions and, as such,\npresents a rich variety of sounds and rhythms in its mu-\nsic. Brazil has long been seen as a source of inspiration\nto many world-class musicians. It is easy to understand that\nthe universality of the music of Brazil is a reÔ¨Çection of the\ncountry‚Äôs history that includes native Brazilians with their\nrhythms and harmonies, being mixed with European (Por-\ntuguese primarily) and African sounds.\nBrazilian music was also inÔ¨Çuenced by sounds from other\nparts of the world. By the end of the 1950s, one of the\nmost important movements in MPB came to light: the Bossa\nNova , which introduced to the world names such as Tom Jo-\nbim, Jo Àúao Gilberto and Luiz Bonf ¬¥a. By the end of 1960s,\nthe inÔ¨Çuence of rock has reached Brazil leading to a move-\nment called Tropicalismo led by the likes of Caetano Veloso,\n441Poster Session 3\nGilberto Gil and Tom Z ¬¥e. Other smaller movements: Jovem\nGuarda (driven by a need for songs with simple lyrics) Pes-\nsoal de Minas (from Minas Gerais State) and Pessoal do\nCear ¬¥a(from Cear ¬¥a State).\nWhat is important to notice is that these movements were\ninÔ¨Çuenced different styles: jazz, rock, regional sounds, coun-\ntry music, etc.\n3. MUSICIAN COLLABORATIONS AS SOCIAL\nNETWORKS\nThe understanding of musical relationships between styles\nand cultures, as well as the relation between music and other\nsciences (particularly Math) have for a long time been of in-\nterest to musicologists, independently of the music origin,\nbe it classical, popular, or other genre [3, 7, 14, 17]. More\nrecently we have seen a revival of works on musical rela-\ntionships due to the demand for recommendation systems\nin the online world [6, 10, 15]. Companies would like to\nknow more about people‚Äôs taste based on prior knowledge\nabout their likes and dislikes. There are many approaches\nfor recommendation systems and in one way or the other\nthey require some understanding of musical relationships.\nSince the late 1990s we have been seeing the emergence\nof a new multidisciplinary Ô¨Åeld, named Network Sciences .\nThis Ô¨Åeld provides a framework for modeling interactions\nbetween entities so as to reveal properties at a macro level\nwhich may not be noticeable at the individual level.\nTechniques from Network Sciences have been success-\nfully applied to music. In general, the works relating mu-\nsic and networks do not attempt to create recommendation\nsystems although that can be seen as a consequence of the\nunderstanding of the relationships. Park et al. [12] have de-\nscribed a study in which a social network of contemporary\nmusicians have been created from the allmusic.com (AMG)\nand compared it with another music network in which mu-\nsicians are connected based on critics views of their simi-\nlarities. Gleiser and Danon [9] studied communities in Jazz\nusing the edge-betweenness community detection algorithm\nfrom Girvan and Newman [8]. The network was created by\nlinking musicians if they played in the same band. The com-\nmunity analysis found that racial divisions exists within Jazz\nbands with groups members being mostly black or mostly\nwhite. Gleiser and Danon have also created a jazz band net-\nwork in which bands are linked if they have a musician in\ncommon. The jazz band analysis found that communities\nof bands are divided based on the location they generally\nrecord.\nRecently, the application of concepts of complex net-\nworks have been discussed as very useful to systems dealing\nwith music recommendation [5]. As we move increasingly\ntowards online delivery of music and as the concept of an\nalbum is replaced by people picking and choosing individ-\nual songs they enjoy, recommendation becomes an impor-\ntant process to the music industry. Music recommendation\nsystems are also crucial in a world where the availability ofmusic can easily overwhelm the listener. In this paper, we\nmove closer towards understanding the structure of the net-\nwork of collaborations in Brazilian music which in turn may\naid the development of recommendation systems for MPB.\n4. BUILDING SOCIAL NETWORKS FROM\nCOLLABORATIONS\nThe Ô¨Årst step in our study was to collect a dataset related to\nBrazilian Music. There are many sites available online with\ncatalogues of records (CDs, LPs) of MPB. The two most fa-\nmous ones are: Ricardo Cravo Albin‚Äôs dictionary of Brazil-\nian music1and Maria Luiza Kfouri‚Äôs personal discogra-\nphy2. Although the former is more extensive it lacks a in-\nformation about the songs and the musicians of each album.\nWe opted to go with the later because it is quite complete\nabout musicians who participate on the record, all songs in\nthe album, the composers of each song, and the musicians\ninvolved in the recording.\nAfter all was done, we had a dataset with 6,149 albums\nof which 5,302 feature musicians. There are 506 albums\nwith only one musician, therefore, because of the way we\ndeÔ¨Åne an edge, these musicians would not appear in the net-\nwork unless they appear in another album that feature two\nor more musicians. There are 16,718 musicians that con-\ntributed to 85,133 tracks. There are 10,490 composers and\n1,913 artists. In order to better understand the structure of\nBrazilian music we concentrate on musicians (who play the\nmusic) and composers (who write the music).\n4.1 Metrics\nThe literature in Network Sciences includes a number of\nmetrics that can be computed to characterize a network which,\nin turn, may reveal interesting patterns in the relationships\nof nodes. The analysis of metrics related to the topology\nof networks have long been used in Social Networks in an\narea generally referred to as Social Network Analysis (SNA)\n[16]. In this paper we concentrate on two measures of nodes\nin the social networks we deal with because they enable us\nto rank nodes.\nNode Degree: The degree of a node is a metric that refers\nto how many connections the entity represented by\nthe node has in the social network. Higher degree\nis generally associated with a higher inÔ¨Çuence in the\nnetwork because that node can quickly reach many\nothers.\nPagerank: Although the degree looks at the importance of\na node, it considers the importance in isolation. How-\never, it is generally the case that the importance of a\nnode depends on the importance of nodes that have a\nrelation with it. In PageRank, important nodes pass\non their importance to other nodes they are connected\n1www.dicionariompb.com.br\n2www.discosdobrasil.com.br\n44212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nto. If an important node points to many other nodes,\nits importance is weighted by the number of connec-\ntions it has.\n4.2 Networks of Collaborations in Brazilian Music\nOne pre-condition to perform network analysis is to cor-\nrectly chose what the nodes in the network represent and\nwhat is used for the relationship between these nodes [4].\nIn this paper we would like to understand the structure of\nBrazilian music by looking at networks of musicians and\ncomposers. These networks will allow us to move a step\ncloser to answering questions like: who are the seminal in-\ndividuals in the Brazilian music world?\nIn our Ô¨Årst network, we look at the structure of people\nwho play the music, what we call the Network of Musicians\n(NoM). Secondly, we look at who is writing the music being\nplayed, what we call Network of Composers (NoC). To cre-\nate these networks we have to look at the dataset and Ô¨Ånd ap-\npropriate information by projecting the dataset on these two\nkids of relationships. In the NoM, a musician is linked to an-\nother if they have participated together in at least one album.\nFor the NoC we have used composers as nodes and the re-\nlationship between them exists if they have composed some\nmusic together‚ÄîBrazilian music is in fact quite unique in\nthis sense since most songs are born out of collaborations.\nIn both network instances, since a person can participate in\nmore than one collaboration, we use a weighted represen-\ntation of the relationship in which the weight of the edge\n(i, j),wij, represents the total number of albums the mu-\nsicians iand jhave played together for the case of NoM,\nand how many songs they have composed together for the\ncase of NoC. The NoM contains 16,442 nodes and 844,223\nedges, while the NoC is a much sparser network with 8,152\nnodes and 12,923 edges.\n5. ANALYSIS OF THE NETWORKS\nThe social network we analyzed contains works from more\nthan 60 years of Brazilian music. When discussing the in-\nÔ¨Çuence of a person in a social network the number of collab-\norations she has is of prime importance. In social network\nterms, the number of collaborations is expressed by the de-\ngree of the node in the network. For instance, if a node x\nrepresenting a person collaborated with 4 others his degree,\ndeg(x) = 4 . Note however that degree does not consider\nthe ‚Äúsize‚Äù of the collaboration, so if a person collaborated\nwith the another 5 times, only the weighted degree, wdeg\ncaptures this information. In order to have a complete pic-\nture we need both the degree (number of different collab-\norations) and weighted degree (number of total collabora-\ntions). We have used the entire dataset and ranked musi-\ncians and composers by the number of collaborators. Tables\n1 and 2 show the rankings by degree but we also display the\nweighted degree.\nTable 1 shows the list of musicians in Brazilian music.\nMost of these are probably unknown to the general pub-lic because they form what we like to call the ‚Äúscaffold-\ning of Brazilian music‚Äù. With a few exceptions, these are\nthe musicians who are respected in their art but generally\ndo not work as leaders in recordings. Some of the num-\nbers presented are quite impressive. Despite the incomplete-\nness of our dataset (see Section 6 for description of our fu-\nture work), we see many musicians who have collaborated\nwith more than 2,000 others, a feat not so easily achievable.\nThese musicians are able to carry inÔ¨Çuences from an album\nto another and are major contributors of cross-fertilization\nbetween brazilian styles.\nAnother interesting observation from Table 1 is that the\nnational instrument from Brazil, the classical guitar (Hornbostel-\nSachs number 321.322), is not present. We believe that this\nis the case because the musicians above belong to this ‚Äúscaf-\nfolding‚Äù class which works on albums as supporting mem-\nbers and not as the main personnel. The table shows the\nimportance of classical instruments even for popular music.\nTable 2 describes the ranking of composers according to\ndegrees. Here the disparities are more prominent between\ndegand wdeg . This is expected because some composers\ncollaborate with few others but write many compositions\nwith them. For instance, this is the case with Vinicius de\nMoraes (in bold in Table 2) has deg=59 but wdeg =3,392. It\nis worth noticing that our wdeg is based on the total number\nof compositions that appears in the dataset (not on unique\ncompositions); this choice is made on purpose for the com-\nposers study because we want wdeg to be more than just a\ncount of different compositions but also give a notion of im-\nportance of the individual. If a composers has then one col-\nlaboration ( deg=1) but that composition has been recorded\n1,000 times in the dataset, his wdeg =1,000. For us that\ncomposer is important to the structure of brazilian music\nalthough she has not composed many pieces‚Äîshe would\nbe important because his composition has been frequently\nrecorded.\nTable 2 . List of top 30 composers by the number of dif-\nferent collaborations ( deg). However some of the collabo-\nrations are repeated, meaning that the composers may write\nmore than one song with a collaborator.

However\nthese names represent the new generation of Brazilian com-\nposers who make very good use of social media and collab-\norate with many other musicians. The rankings in the table\nconsiderers all data in the dataset. To better understand the\nevolution of these rankings we performed a temporal analy-\nsis but using pagerank rather than degree ranks.\nThe Ô¨Årst study we have performed using pagerank is shown\nin Figure 1. These ranks are per decade and follow the po-\nsition of the top 50 musicians and composers in the most\nrecent decade. It is important to understand that the rank-\ning in decades other than the most recent one is relative to\neach other. We took the top 50 musicians and composers\nin the most recent decade and followed their relative ranks\nin other decades. For instance, Noel Rosa appears as the\ntop ranked composer in Figure 1(right) for the most recent\ndecade but in the 14thposition in the 80s; this 14thmeans\nrelative to the 50 composers listed in the 2000 decade. In ab-\nsolute terms, Noel Rosa can (it probably is) lower than the\n14thposition. The connections in the social networks for\neach decade considers only the collaborations in albums of\nthat decade, which explain sudden changes in the rankings.\nA musician or composer that was top in a decade may be\nirrelevant in others because he was not active or because his\ncompositions were not recorded by musicians in that period.\nWe can see in Figure 1 that composers ranks are more\nstable than the musicians meaning that the relative ranks are\nbetter maintained for composers (the lines not cross as of-\nten and as radically). We can also argue that musicians do\nnot have as high longevity as composers. A musician who\nis very active today may not have been very active a few\nyears back. A clear example of this is the musician Michel\nBessler who does not even appear in albums prior to 1980 al-though he is 10thmost important musician of today. Bessler\nis the spalla of the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra and has\nparticipated in many popular albums (see Table 1). Figure 1\nconÔ¨Årms this longevity observation, which is expected since\nthe NoM requires active participation of the musician in the\nrecording while the NoC includes people who may have\neven be deceased but continue to have their music recorded\n(e.g. Noel Rosa).\nLast we look at the evolution of rankings using accu-\nmulative networks. While Figure 1 looks at collaborations\nin isolation, Figure 2 shows the ranking (also according to\npagerank) of musicians and composers using an accumula-\ntive approach. Here we want to see how the ranks evolve\nif we consider the collaborations until a particular year but\nincluding all information since the Ô¨Årst date we have infor-\nmation on the dataset. For instance, the ranking in 2010\nconsiders all the works available in the dataset, that is, the\nfull collaboration network. Antecedent years (2007, 2004,\netc.) consider collaborations from the Ô¨Årst data available in\nthe dataset until the given year. Hence, the change from one\nyear to another (3 years appart) is due to the work produced\nin the last 3 years.\nThe use of accumulated networks allows us to see a lit-\ntle better how the structure changes as new musicians and\ncomposers become active. An excellent example of this is\nArnaldo Antunes who appears in Figure 2(right) in 4thposi-\ntion but decrease his relative rank quite rapidly until disap-\npearing completely in 1986. Arnaldo Antunes appeared to\nin Brazilian music scene as a member of a rock band called\nTitÀúas in the mid-80s. After leaving the band, he emerged\nas one of the main composers in Brazil with many collab-\norators (which inÔ¨Çuences his pagerank). Most recently, his\ncompositions have been part of recordings of many respected\nbrazilian singers such as Marisa Monte and C ¬¥assia Eller.\nAnother interesting class of composers that we can see in\n44412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nM√°rcio Eymard MallardJorge Kundert RanevskyJos√© Alves da SilvaJorge HelderBernardo BesslerPaschoal PerrotaJaques MorelenbaumJess√© Sadoc do Nascimento FilhoJo√£o Daltro de AlmeidaMichel BesslerRicardo AmadoCarlos Eduardo HackRobertinho SilvaCarlos MaltaAlceu de Almeida ReisWalter HackNailor ProvetaMarcos SuzanoDirceu LeiteJesu√≠na Noronha PassarotoAntonella Lima PareschiMarie Christine SpringuelJos√© Rog√©rio RosaMarcos EsgulebaWilson das NevesOv√≠dio BritoTeco CardosoToninho FerraguttiRoberto MarquesJamil JoanesFrederick StephanyJos√© Ricardo Volker TaboadaCarlinhos 7 CordasUbaldo VersolatoCristiano AlvesRui AlvimTrambiqueCrist√≥v√£o BastosZ√© Carlos BigornaM√°rcio AlmeidaArmando Mar√ßalZeca Assump√ß√£oGordinhoAndr√©a Ernest DiasM√°rcio MontarroyosVittor SantosDener de Castro CampolinaMarcelo MartinsJairo Diniz SilvaPaula Vianna Prates Barbato195019601970198019902000\nNoel RosaPaulo C√©sar PinheiroArnaldo AntunesD√©lcio CarvalhoNelson CavaquinhoAdoniran BarbosaLuiz GonzagaIvan LinsJo√£o DonatoZeca BaleiroAtaulfo AlvesHerm√≠nio Bello de CarvalhoWilson BatistaNei LopesVinicius de MoraesAldir BlancChico BuarqueCarlinhos BrownGilberto GilMilton NascimentoChico C√©sarHerivelto MartinsJo√£o do ValeBenedito LacerdaTom JobimCaetano VelosoJackson do PandeiroItamar Assump√ß√£oElton MedeirosHeitor Villa-LobosCartolaFrancis HimeAry BarrosoCarlos LyraMoreira da SilvaTom Z√©Seu JorgeAlceu Valen√ßaPedro Lu√≠sJo√£o de BarroPixinguinhaArlindo CruzBebel GilbertoGeraldo PereiraCatulo da Paix√£o CearenseMarino PintoMoraes MoreiraLenineBidGereba195019601970198019902000\nFigure 1 . Rank of the top 50 musicians (left) of the last decade and how these ranks evolve per decade. The pagerank of\n2000 is absolute but for the other decades it represents how these musicians rank against each other. For instance, none of the\nmusicians ranked today were present in recordings from 1950s (1950-1959). On the right picture, we have the rank of the top\n50 composers of the last decade and how these ranks evolve per decade. Individuals marked with an ‚Üíare examples discussed\nin the text.\nFigure 2 is well represented by Caetano Veloso. The accu-\nmulated ranking shows that Caetano Veloso has maintained\nhimself active through several decades (by composing and\nhaving his songs recorded by other artists) and he is today\nstill the 5thmost important composer in Brazil. Compare\nthis to his position in Figure 1; since that analysis considers\nonly recordings per decade in isolation we see that Caetano\nVeloso is not so well positioned in more recent years. The\nfact is that Figures 2 and 1 taken together give us a good\nidea of the ranking of a musician and composer and how it\nevolves.\nLastly, our results allow us to observe scenarios like what\nhappens to Zeca Baleiro in Figure 1. Because the study takes\ndecades in isolation we can see that he appears high in the\nrankings but not at all in the accumulative ranking in Figure\n2. This is a case where we have a upcoming composer who\nhas been active only very recently and is part of the ranking\nof the last decade but not yet part of the entire history.\n6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper we demonstrated that the construction of social\nnetworks and the use of metrics rooted in network sciences\nmay help us understand the structure of Brazilian music.\nRankings related to music are always controversial because\nof the attachment people feel to music. However we believe\nour approach is less biased and provides a good understand-\ning of the structure of Brazilian music. Our work shows\nthat the network of musicians is less stable than the networkof composers. This result is expected because musicians\nactively participate in the recording while composers par-\nticipate by having their songs recorded‚Äîa composer may\neven be deceased when his composition is recorded. Our\nhope was to have a social network of musicians based on\nthem playing together on speciÔ¨Åc tracks rather than on an\nalbum as we believe this is a more accurate representation\nof the collaboration. However to our knowledge, no dataset\nof MPB includes the information per track.\nThe two kinds of rankings provided (and their visualiza-\ntion) also allows us to understand how the rankings change\nwith time. An analysis not included in this paper (due to\nspace restriction) seem to indicate that a composer needs to\nbe well ranked for about 30 years to appear in the accumu-\nlative rankings. This appears to indicate that 30 years for\nBrazilian music a measure of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù for a composers‚Äî\nwhat differentiates them from one-hit composers.\nWe continue to work on the current dataset on many fronts.\nWe are currently collecting more data to make the dataset\nmore complete since it is still incomplete particularly with\nregards to older recordings. Next, we intend to consider the\ndate of the composition in our analysis although this data is\nappearing to be very hard to gather. With this information\nwe believe we can have another dimension of the structure\nof composers. Last, our ultimate goal is to be able to add\nthe concept of reputation to the study and for that we may\nhave to consider a third category of individuals. A composer\nmay become part of the rankings by having one of his com-\npositions recorded by major singers (e.g. Elis Regina).

INTRODUCTION\nWith the rapid expansion of digital repositories of music,\nsuch as iTunes, Spotify, last.fm, and the like, efÔ¨Åcient meth-\nods to provide content-based access to this kind of music\nrepositories have become increasingly important. To be able\nto cluster documents, a notion of the similarity between these\ndocuments is essential. Hence, within Music Information\nRetrieval (MIR), the development of musical similarity mea-\nsures plays a prominent role. Music can be related in many\ndifferent aspects, e.g. melody, genre, rhythm, etc.; this paper\nfocuses on similarity of musical harmony. Music retrieval\nbased on harmony offers obvious beneÔ¨Åts: it allows for Ô¨Ånd-\ning cover songs (especially when melodies vary), songs of a\ncertain family (like Blues or Rhythm Changes), or variations\nover a theme in baroque music, to name a few.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.\nI V IV I V/V\nC F D G7 7C\n{ Ton Ton Sub DomFigure 1 . A typical chord sequence. The chord labels are\nprinted below the score, and the scale degrees and func-\ntional analysis above the score. Tonic, dominant, and sub-\nsominant are denoted with Ton,Dom , and sub, respectively.\nTo be able to understand why two chord sequences are\nharmonically related, we believe it is important to examine\nchords not only in isolation but also the context in which\nthey occur. For this, we draw greatly on classical and jazz\nharmony theory. In the last decades, many music theorists\nhave studied tonal harmony and observed that within a se-\nquence not every chord is equally important. This suggests\nthat tonal harmony is organised hierarchically. Within a\nsequence of chords, some chords can be removed leaving\nthe global harmony structure intact, while removing other\nchords can signiÔ¨Åcantly change how the chord sequence is\nperceived. For example in Figure 1, the D7chord could be\nremoved without changing the general structure of the har-\nmony, while removing the G7or the C at the end would\nchange the harmony structure. This suggests that chords\ncan have different functional roles, and therefore different\nimportance.\nNowadays there is a rich body of literature that aims to\nexplain the order and regularities in Western tonal harmony,\nand various ways to analyse the function of a chord in its\ntonal context have been proposed [9, 14, 18]. Unfortunately,\nthe majority of these theories are formulated rather infor-\nmally and lack descriptions with mathematical precision or\ncomputational executability. Although there are exceptions,\nlike the Tonal Pitch Space model [8] and David Temperley‚Äôs\nMelisma [22], the lack of mathematical precision has ham-\npered the successful application of harmony models to prac-\ntical MIR related tasks, such as automatic analysis, similar-\nity estimation, content-based retrieval, or the improvement\nof low-level feature extraction.\n67Poster Session 1\nContribution We present HARM TRACE1, a system for\nanalysing Western tonal harmony and determining harmonic\nsimilarity, implemented robustly and efÔ¨Åciently in the pure,\ntype-safe functional programming language Haskell. It is\nÔ¨Çexible, in the sense that it can be easily adapted and main-\ntained, robust against noisy data, and capable of displaying\nharmonic analyses in a clear way. We evaluate the retrieval\nperformance of HARM TRACE by comparing it to a baseline\nalignment system and to two earlier approaches to harmonic\nsimilarity in a retrieval experiment, using a corpus of 5,028\nchord sequences. The results show that HARM TRACE out-\nperforms all other harmonic similarity measures and that ex-\nploiting knowledge about the harmonic function of a chord\nimproves retrieval performance.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows. After a\nreview of related work in Section 2, we explain how an au-\ntomatic harmony analysis is performed by a music theoret-\nically founded knowledge system of tonal harmony (Sec-\ntion 3). Next, we deÔ¨Åne harmonic similarity of two se-\nquences of annotated chords as the maximum local align-\nment score (Section 4). In Section 5 we compare the re-\ntrieval performance of HARM TRACE to three other harmonic\nsimilarity measures. Finally, we conclude the paper with\na short discussion on harmonic similarity and pointing out\ndirections for future research (Section 6).\n2. RELATED WORK\nGrammatical models of tonal harmony harmony have a long\nhistory in music research, e.g. [9, 15, 20]. The harmony\nmodel of HARM TRACE is based on the generative formalism\nproposed by Rohrmeier [16, 17]. He models tonal harmony\nas an elaborate recursive context-free grammar (CFG). His\nmodel extends ideas of the Generative Theory of Tonal Mu-\nsic(GTTM) [9] and Schenkerian Analysis [18], and cap-\ntures form, theoretical harmonic function [14], phrasing, and\nmodulation. De Haas et al. [4] performed a Ô¨Årst attempt at\nimplementing Rohrmeier‚Äôs grammar and using it for deÔ¨Ån-\ning harmonic similarity. HARM TRACE transports these ideas\nto a functional setting, solving many of the typical problems\naccociated with context free parsing.\nThere exist other systems that address polyphonic mu-\nsic similarity, but generally these are embedded into larger\nretrieval systems and take audio or score information as in-\nput, e.g. [13]. We are aware of two other systems that focus\nsolely on harmonic similarity and compute similarity values\nfrom textual chord descriptions: the Tonal Pitch Step Dis-\ntance ( TPSD ) [5], and the Chord Sequence Alignment Sys-\ntem\n(CSAS ) [6]. A beneÔ¨Åt of evaluating only a similarity mea-\nsure is that errors caused by the feature extraction or chord\n1Harmony Analysis and Retrieval of Music with Type-level Represen-\ntations of Abstract Chords Entitieslabelling methods do not inÔ¨Çuence the retrieval evaluation.\nThe TPSD and CSAS are compared elaborately in [3]; we\nintroduce them brieÔ¨Çy here.\nThe TPSD uses Lerdahl‚Äôs [8] Tonal Pitch Space ( TPS)\nas its main musical model. TPS is a model of tonality that\nÔ¨Åts musicological intuitions, correlates well with empirical\nÔ¨Åndings from music cognition, and can be used to calculate\na distance between two arbitrary chords. The TPS model\ntakes into account the number of steps on the circle of Ô¨Åfths\nbetween the roots of the chords, and the amount of over-\nlap between the chord structures of the two chords and their\nrelation to the global key.\nThe general idea behind the TPSD is to use the TPS to\ncompare the change of perceived chordal distance to the\ntonic over time. For every chord, the TPS distance to the\nkey of the sequence is calculated, resulting in a step func-\ntion. Next, the distance between two chord sequences is\ndeÔ¨Åned as the minimal area between the two step functions\nover all possible horizontal circular shifts. To prevent that\nlonger sequences yield larger distances, the score is normal-\nized by the duration of the shortest song.\nThe CSAS [6] is based on local alignment: by perform-\ning elementary deletion, insertion, and substitution opera-\ntions, one chord sequence is transformed into the other. The\nactual similarity value is deÔ¨Åned as the total sum of all edit\noperations at all beat positions. To improve the retrieval per-\nformance of the classical alignment approach, Hanna et al.\nexperimented with various musical data representations and\nsubstitution functions. They found a key-relative represen-\ntation, based on the interval between the root of the chord\nand the key, to work well and preferred substituting only\nwhen the chord root and triad were not identical. In the ex-\nperiments in [3] the CSAS outperformed the TPSD in 4 of\nthe 6 tasks.\n3. HARMONY MODEL\nThe HARM TRACE harmony model implements and extends\nthe ideas of Rohrmeier [16,17]. However, HARM TRACE dif-\nfers from Rohrmeier‚Äôs grammar in several aspects. Rohr-\nmeier‚Äôs model is more elaborate, as it includes phrasing and\nmodulation. However, we believe that modulation and phras-\ning cannot be implemented as context-free rules in the way\nRohrmeier formulates them. Rohrmeier‚Äôs CFG allows for\nmodulating into any key at any point in a sequence; from an\nimplementation perspective, this would generate too many\nambiguous solutions for a single sequence of chords. Fur-\nthermore, whereas Rohrmeier‚Äôs grammar aims to explain\nthe core rules of tonal harmony, our model exhibits a bias\ntowards jazz harmony, due to the nature of the data used in\nSection 5.\nWe model tonal harmony as a complex Haskell datatype.\nTo explain our model in a clear manner, that does not re-\n6812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nPiece\nDom\nV7\nG7Ton\nIm\nCm6Dom\nDom\nDom\nV7\nG7/sharp5/sharp9Sub\nIIm\nDm7/flat5Sub\nII/flat\nD/flat‚àÜV/II/flat7\nVI/flat7\nA/flat7V/VI/flatm\nIII/flatm\nE/flatm7Ton\nIm\nCm6Dom\nDom\nDom\nV7\nG7/sharp5/sharp9Sub\nIIm\nDm7/flat5Sub\nIVm\nFm7Ton\nIm\nCm6\nFigure 2 .

A CFG deÔ¨Ånes a language: it accepts only\ncombinations of words that are valid sequences of the lan-\nguage. A collection of Haskell datatypes can be viewed as\na very powerful CFG: the type-checker accepts a combina-\ntion of values if their structure matches the structure pre-\nscribed by the datatype, and rejects this combination if it\ndoes not. Within HARM TRACE , the chords are the values and\nthe datatypes represent the relations between the structural\nelements in tonal harmony.\n3.1 A model of Western tonal harmony\nFigure 2 shows an example analysis as produced by HARM -\nTRACE . We start by introducing a variable (denoted with\nbold font) for the mode of the key of the piece, which can\nbe major or minor. The mode variable is used to parametrise\nall the speciÔ¨Åcations of our harmony model; some speciÔ¨Å-\ncations hold for both modes ( m), while other speciÔ¨Åcations\nhold only for the major (Maj) or minor mode (Min). The\nmode is displayed as a subscript, which we leave out when\nit is clear from the context. Currently, HARM TRACE cannot\nyet derive the key of the piece automatically. Hence, to be\nable to use key-relative representations, external informa-\ntion about the key of the piece is essential.\n1Piece m‚ÜíFunc+m\n2Func m‚ÜíTonm|Dom m\n3Dom m‚ÜíSubmDom mm‚àà{Maj,Min}\nSpec. 1‚Äì3 deÔ¨Åne that a valid chord sequence, Piece m, con-\nsists of at least one and possibly more functional categories.\nA functional category classiÔ¨Åes chords as being part of a\ntonic ( Tonm), dominant ( Dom m), or subdominant ( Sub m)\nstructure, where a subdominant must always precede a dom-\ninant. The order of the dominants and tonics is not con-\nstrained by the model, and they are not grouped into larger\nphrases.4Ton Maj‚ÜíIMaj|IMajIVMajIMaj\n5Ton Min‚ÜíIm\nMin|Im\nMinIVm\nMinIm\nMin\n6Dom m‚ÜíV7m|Vm\n7Sub Maj‚ÜíIVm\nMaj|IIm\nMaj|...\n8Sub Min‚ÜíIVMin|IIm\nMin|...c‚àà{‚àÖ,m,7,0}\nSpec. 4‚Äì8 translate dominants, tonics, and sub-dominants\ninto scale degrees (denoted with Roman numerals). A scale\ndegree is a datatype that is parametrised by a mode, a chord\nclass, and the interval between the chord root and the key.\nThe chord class is used to constrain the application of certain\nspeciÔ¨Åcations, e.g. Spec. 13 and 14, and can represent the\nclass of major (no superscript), minor ( m), dominant seventh\n(7), and diminished seventh chords (0). A tonic translates\ninto a Ô¨Årst degree in both major and minor mode, albeit with\na minor triad in the latter case, or it allows for initiation of a\nplagal cadence. A dominant type is converted into the Ô¨Åfth\nor seventh scale degree with a dominant or diminished class,\nrespectively. Similarly, a sub-dominant is converted into the\nfourth or second degree.\n9IMaj‚Üí\"C:maj\"|\"C:maj6\"|\"C:maj7\"|...\n10Im\nMin‚Üí\"C:min\"|\"C:min7\"|\"C:min9\"|...\n11V7m‚Üí\"G:7\"|\"G:7(b9,13)\"|\"G:(#11)\"|...\n12VII0m‚Üí\"B:dim(bb7)\"\nFinally, scale degrees are translated into the actual sur-\nface chords that are used as input for the model. The chord\nnotation used is that of Harte et al. [7]. The conversions are\ntrivial and illustrated by a small number of speciÔ¨Åcations\nabove. The model uses a key-relative representation, and\nin Spec. 9‚Äì12 we used chords in the key of C. Hence, a IMaj\ntranslates to the set of C chords with a major triad, option-\nally augmented with additional chord notes that do not make\nthe chord minor or dominant. Similarly, V7\nMajtranslates to\nall G chords with a major triad and a minor seventh, etc.\n13Xcm‚ÜíV/X7mXcm\n14X7m‚ÜíV/XmmX7mc‚àà{‚àÖ,m,7,0}\nX‚àà{I,II/flat,II,..., VII}\nSpec. 13 accounts for the classical preparation of a scale\ndegree by its secondary dominant, stating that every scale\ndegree, independently of its mode, chord class, and root in-\nterval, can be preceded by a chord of the dominant class,\none Ô¨Åfth up. The function V/Xwhich transposes an arbi-\ntrary scale degree Xa Ô¨Åfth up. Similarly, every scale de-\ngree of the dominant class can be prepared with the minor\nchord one Ô¨Åfth above (Spec. 14). These two speciÔ¨Åcations\ntogether allow for the derivation of the typical and promi-\nnently present ii-V motions in jazz harmony.\n15X7m‚ÜíV/flat/X7m\n16X7m‚ÜíII/flat/X0m\n69Poster Session 1\n17X0m‚ÜíIII/flat/X0m\nThe harmony model in HARM TRACE further allows vari-\nous scale degree transformations. Every dominant chord can\nbe transformed into its tritone substitution with Spec. 15.\nThis speciÔ¨Åcation uses another transposition function V/flat/X\nwhich transposes a scale degree Xa diminished Ô¨Åfth‚Äîa\ntritone‚Äîup. Likewise, diminished seventh chords are treated\nas regular dominant seventh chords without a root and with\na/flat9 (rule 16). For instance, an A /flat0, consisting of A /flat, B, D,\nand F, is viewed as a G7/flat9, which consists of G, B, D, F, and\nA/flat0. An exceptional characteristic of diminished seventh\nchords‚Äîconsisting only of notes separated by minor third\nintervals‚Äîis that they are completely symmetrical. Hence,\na diminished seventh chord has four enharmonic equivalent\nchords that can be reached by transposing the chord a minor\nthird up with the transposition function III/flat/X(Spec. 17).\nBecause we want the application of the Spec. 13‚Äì17 to ter-\nminate, we limit the number of recursive applications of\nthese rules. For the technical details about how this is done,\nwe refer to [10].\nWe have presented a condensed view on the core spec-\niÔ¨Åcations of the model, but due to space limitation we had\nto omit some speciÔ¨Åcation for diatonic chains of Ô¨Åfths, bor-\nrowings from the parallel mode and the Neapolitan chord\n(see Figure 2). For the full speciÔ¨Åcation of the model we\nrefer to [2] and to the code bundle found online.2\n3.2 Parsing\nHaving a formal speciÔ¨Åcation as a datatype, the next step is\nto deÔ¨Åne a parser to transform textual chord labels into val-\nues of our datatype. Writing a parser that parses labels into\nour datatype would normally mean writing tedious code that\nclosely resembles the datatype speciÔ¨Åcation. However, in\nHaskell we can use datatype-generic programming3tech-\nniques to avoid writing most of the repetitive portions of the\ncode. Moreover, not only the parser can be derived auto-\nmatically, but also a pretty-printer for displaying the har-\nmony analysis in tree form, and functions for comparing\nthese analyses. This makes the development and Ô¨Åne-tuning\nof the model much easier, as only the datatype speciÔ¨Åcations\nhave to be changed, and the code adapts itself automatically.\nFor technical details of the implementation and the generic\nprogramming techniques we refer to [10].\nBecause music is an ever changing, culturally dependent,\nand extremely diverse art form, we cannot hope to model\nall valid harmonic relations in our datatype. Furthermore,\nsongs may contain mistakes or mistyped chords, perhaps\nfeature extraction noise, or malformed data of dubious har-\nmonic validity. This is problematic if we reject chord se-\nquences that do not Ô¨Åt the grammatical speciÔ¨Åcation without\n2http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HarmTrace-0.7\n3Not to be confused with regular polymorphism, as in Java generics.returning any information about harmony analysis. How-\never, these problems often occur at a speciÔ¨Åc position in the\npiece and most of the song still makes sense. In HARM -\nTRACE we use a parsing library [21] that features error-cor-\nrection: chords that do not Ô¨Åt the structure are automatically\ndeleted or preceded by inserted chords, according to heuris-\ntics computed from the grammar structure. For most songs,\nparsing proceeds with none or very few corrections. Songs\nwith a very high error ratio denote bad input or wrong key\nassignment, which results in meaningless scale degrees.\nMusic, and harmony in particular, is intrinsically am-\nbiguous. Hence, certain chords can have multiple meanings\nwithin a tonal context. This is reÔ¨Çected in the model above.\nWe control the number of possible analyses by constrain-\ning the application of most speciÔ¨Åcations. Examples hereof\nare the restriction of secondary dominants to scale degrees\nof the dominant class, and limiting the number of possible\nrecursive applications of the secondary dominant rule.\n4. SIMILARITY ESTIMATION\nAfter having obtained an harmonic analysis from our model,\na chord is categorised as being part of either a dominant,\nsub-dominant, or tonic structure (Spec. 4‚Äì8). Furthermore,\nwe also annotate whether a chord is part of secondary dom-\ninant preparation (Spec. 13‚Äì14) and label whether it has\nbeen transformed (Spec. 15‚Äì17). We hypothesise that these\nannotations are helpful in determining harmonic similarity.\nHence, we represent an annotated chord as a quintuple of\nthe following form: ( X,c,func,prep,trans ), where Xrepre-\nsents a scale degree, ca chord class (as deÔ¨Åned in Section 3),\nfunc the functional category, prep the functional preparation,\ne.g. being part of a secondary dominant (V/X), and trans a\nscale degree transformation, e.g. a tritone or diminished sev-\nenth substitution. For estimating the similarity between two\nsequences of these annotated chords we calculate the align-\nment score obtained in a classical alignment procedure [19].\nThe quality of an alignment heavily depends on the inser-\ntion, deletions, match, and mismatch parameters. We use a\nconstant insertion and deletion penalty of ‚àí2 and we deÔ¨Åne\nthe similarity between the annotated chords as a function,\nsim(ai,bj)‚Üí[‚àí1,6], that takes a pair of chords, aiandbj,\nand returns an integer denoting the (dis-) similarity. Here i\nandjdenote the beat position of aiandbjin the compared\nchord sequences AandB.\nsim(X1,c1,func1,prep1,trans 1) (X2,c2,func2,prep2,trans 2) =\nifX1‚â°X2‚àßc1‚â°c2then 2+mprep+mtranselse‚àí1\nwhere mprep=simprep(Prep1,Prep2)\nmtrans=ifTrans 1‚â°Trans 2then 1else0\nWithin sim, the function sim prep‚Üí[0,3]compares two pos-\nsible scale degree preparations, returning 3 is the prepara-\ntion is identical, 2 if both preparations involve the same Ô¨Åfth\n7012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\njump, 1 if they are both a preparation, and 0 in all other\ncases.\nThe Ô¨Ånal similarity score is obtained by calculating the\noptimal alignment between two annotated chord sequences\nand normalising the alignment score. Because the preÔ¨Åx of\nan optimal alignment is also an optimal alignment, an op-\ntimal solution can be found by exploiting the dynamic pro-\ngramming paradigm. To ensure that the alignment is max-\nimal, we construct an array Twhich stores the cumulative\nalignment score so far.

We obtain our Ô¨Ånal similar-\nity measure, SIM(A,B)‚Üí[0,1], by normalising the sum of\nalignment scores, T[n,m], by the sizes of AandB:\nSIM(A,B) =T[n,m]\nn¬∑T[n,m]\nm\n5. EV ALUATION\nTo evaluate the effect of the HARM TRACE harmony model on\nretrieval performance, we compare it to a baseline alignment\nsystem, named TRIAD ALIGN. In TRIAD ALIGN we use the\nexact same alignment code, but the similarity function for\nindividual chords, sim, is replaced by simtriadthat does not\nuse any additional model information.\nsimtriad(X1,triad 1) (X2,triad 2) =\nifX1‚â°X2‚àßtriad 1‚â°triad 2then 4else‚àí1\nHere, triad denotes only whether the chord is major or mi-\nnor, and the Xrepresents the scale degree, as deÔ¨Åned in the\nprevious sections. Note that the TRIAD ALIGN system is very\nsimilar to the CSAS , but uses slightly different parameters\nand normalises the alignment score.\nWe compare the retrieval performance of HARM TRACE ,\nTRIAD ALIGN,TPSD , and CSAS methods (see Section 2) in\na retrieval experiment for which we use the same chord se-\nquence corpus as in [3]. This corpus consists of 5,028 unique\nuser-generated Band-in-a-Box Ô¨Åles that are collected from\nthe Internet. Band-in-a-Box [1] is a commercial software\npackage for generating musical accompaniment based on a\nlead sheet. For extracting the chord label information from\nthe Band-in-a-Box Ô¨Åles we have extended software in [12].TPSD CSAS T RIAD ALIGN HARM TRACE\nMAP 0 .580 0 .696 0 .711 0 .722\nTable 1 . The mean average precision of the rankings based\non the compared similarity measures.\nWithin the corpus, 1,775 songs contain two or more sim-\nilar versions, forming 691 classes of songs. Within a song\nclass, songs have the same title and share a similar melody,\nbut may differ in a number of ways. They may, for instance,\ndiffer in key and form, in the number of repetitions, or may\nsimply use different chords at certain positions. Having\nmultiple chord sequences describing the same song allows\nfor setting up a cover-song -Ô¨Ånding experiment. The title of\nthe song is used as ground-truth and the retrieval challenge\nis to Ô¨Ånd the other chord sequences representing the same\nsong. Although the dataset was automatically Ô¨Åltered to ex-\nclude identical or erroneous pieces, it still includes many\nsongs that are harmonically atypical. The reason for this is\nthat the Ô¨Åles are user-generated, and contain peculiar and un-\nÔ¨Ånished pieces, wrong key assignments, and other errors; it\ncan therefore be considered a ‚Äúreal life‚Äù dataset. The chord\nsequence corpus is available to the research community on\nrequest.\nWe analyse the rankings obtained from the compared sim-\nilarity measures by calculating the Mean Average Precision\n(MAP). The MAP is the average precision averaged over\nall queries, and is a single-Ô¨Ågure measure between 0 and\n1 [11, Chap. 8, p. 160]. We tested whether the differences in\nMAP are signiÔ¨Åcant by performing a non-parametric Fried-\nman test with a signiÔ¨Åcance level of Œ±=0.05. We chose the\nFriedman test because the underlying distribution of the data\nis unknown, and, in contrast to an ANOV A, the Friedman\ndoes not assume a speciÔ¨Åc distribution of variance.4To de-\ntermine which pairs of measurements differ signiÔ¨Åcantly we\nconducted a post-hoc Tukey HSD test. This way of signiÔ¨Å-\ncance testing is standard in MIREX.\nThe MAP scores are displayed in Table 1. There are sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant differences between the runs, œá2(3,N=1775) =\n350, p<0.0001 and also all pairwise differences are statisti-\ncally signiÔ¨Åcant. Hence, we can conclude that HARM TRACE\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the other similarity measures, and\nthat using the harmonic information obtained by our model\nimproves similarity estimation on this dataset.\n6. DISCUSSION\nThe results show that using information about the function\nof a chord improves harmonic similarity. However, not all\nharmony annotations appeared to be beneÔ¨Åcial: although in\nour experiments the functional categories ( Ton,Dom ,Sub)\n4All statistical tests were performed in Matlab 2009a.\n71Poster Session 1\ndid not have a negative effect on the similarity estimation,\nthey did not improve the harmonic similarity either. Perhaps\nthe categories are not distinctive enough to be advantageous.\nWe noticed that similarity measures that did not easily clas-\nsify chords as similar performed best.\nThe retrieval task of Section 5 is a difÔ¨Åcult one because\nthe song class sizes are very small. Often there is only one\nrelated piece in the corpus, and Ô¨Ånding it based on its har-\nmony alone is challenging. We believe that this is a sound\nway of evaluating of harmonic similarity, since nothing else\ncould have inÔ¨Çuence the results but the chords available in\nthe data. Nevertheless, it is stimulating to think about other\nways of evaluating harmonic similarity that go beyond the\nconcept of a cover-song. A fundamental problem is that cur-\nrently there is no good ground-truth that actually captures\nthe harmonic similarity on a gradual (non-binary) scale. But\nhow should such a ground-truth be established: by perform-\ning a large scale user study, or by consulting musical ex-\nperts? These questions remain unanswered, and pose chal-\nlenges for future MIR research.\nBesides similarity estimation, a model of tonal harmony\nmight be useful for answering other MIR-related questions.\nFor instance, chord labelling or optical music recognition\nsystems often recognise chords from audio or score data.\nOur model could be used to suggest harmonically-Ô¨Åtting so-\nlutions when there is high uncertainty in the data. Another\npotential application of HARM TRACE would be in the gener-\nation of harmonically well-formed chord sequences for soft-\nware such as Band-in-a-Box. The TPSD and CSAS do not\noffer such beneÔ¨Åts.\nThe many possible applications of harmony models, like\nthe one in HARM TRACE , together with its positive results\nin retrieval performance, make us believe that formalising\ntonal harmony is crucial in understanding the true nature of\nmusical harmony and harmonic similarity.\nAcknowledgements This work has been partially funded\nby the Dutch ICES/KIS III Bsik project MultimediaN, and\nby the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology\n(FCT) via the SFRH/BD/35999/2007 grant.

INTRODUCTION\nIn this paper, we consider the tasks of automatic annotation\nand ranking of music audio. Automatic annotation consists\nof assigning relevant word descriptors, or tags, to a given\nmusic audio clip. Ranking, on the other hand, consists of\nÔ¨Ånding an audio clip that best corresponds to a given tag,\nor set of tags. These descriptors are able to represent a wide\nrange of semantic concepts such as genre, mood, instrumen-\ntation, etc. Thus, a set of tags provides a high-level descrip-\ntion of an audio clip. This information is useful for tasks like\nmusic recommendation, playlist generation and measuring\nmusic similarity.\nIn order to solve automatic annotation and ranking, we\nneed to build a system that can extract relevant features from\nmusic audio and infer abstract concepts from these features.\nMany content-based music recommendation systems follow\nthe same recipe with minor variations (see [5] for a review).\nFirst, some features are extracted from the audio. Then,\nthese features are summarized over time. Finally, a classiÔ¨Å-\ncation model is trained over the summarized features to ob-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc\r2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.tain tag afÔ¨Ånities. We describe several previous approaches\nthat follow these steps and have been applied to the Mag-\nnatune dataset [13] in Section 3.1. We then present an ap-\nproach that deviates somewhat from the standard recipe by\nintegrating learning steps before and after the temporal sum-\nmarization.\nThis paper has three main contributions. First, we de-\nscribe a simple adaptive preprocessing procedure of the mu-\nsic audio that incorporates only little prior knowledge on\nthe nature of music audio. We show that the features ob-\ntained through this adaptive preprocessing give competitive\nresults when using a relatively simple classiÔ¨Åer. Secondly,\nwe study the impact of the selection and mixing of pool-\ning functions for summarization of the features over time.\nWe introduce the idea of using min-pooling in conjunction\nwith other functions. We show that combining several pool-\ning functions improves the performance of the system. Fi-\nnally, we incorporate the idea of multiscale learning. In or-\nder to do this, we integrate feature learning, time summa-\nrization and classiÔ¨Åcation in one deep learning step. Using\nthis method, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the\nMagnatagatune dataset.\nThe paper is divided as follows. First, we motivate our\nexperiments in Section 2. Then, we expose our experimen-\ntal setup in Section 3. We present and discuss our results in\nSection 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.\n2. MOTIVATION\n2.1 Choosing the right features\nChoosing the right features is crucial for music classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion. Many automatic annotation systems use features such\nas MFCCs [8,12] because they have shown their worth in the\nspeech recognition domain. However, music audio is very\ndifferent from speech audio in many ways. So, MFCCs,\nwhich have been engineered for speech analysis might not\nbe the optimal feature to use for music audio analysis.\nAlternatives have been proposed to replace MFCCs. Re-\ncent work have shown that better classiÔ¨Åcation performance\ncan be achieved by using mel-scaled energy bands of thespectrum [4]. Octave-based spectral contrast features [11]\nhave been shown to also outperform MFCCs for genre clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation. Thus, Ô¨Ånding optimal features for audio classiÔ¨Å-\ncation is still an open problem.\nIn section 3.3, we present a relatively simple audio pre-\nprocessing based on spectral energy bands and principal com-\nponent analysis (PCA).\n2.2 Summarization of the features over time\nAnother important aspect of any automatic tagging system\nworking on music audio is the question of the summariza-\ntion of features over time, potentially allowing one to map a\nvariable-length sequence into a Ô¨Åxed-size vector of features\nthat can be fed to a classiÔ¨Åer. The objective of summariza-\ntion is to transform a joint feature representation into a more\nuseful one that preserves important information while dis-\ncarding noise, redundancy or irrelevant information. Sum-\nmarizing features either in space (e.g. in visual recognition),\nor in time (e.g. in audio analysis) yields representations that\nare compact, invariant to shifts in space or time and robust\nto clutter.\nOne of the most straightforward ways to summarize fea-\ntures is feature pooling. Pooling consists in extracting sim-\nple statistics such as the mean or maximum of the features\nover an excerpt of a given time length. The choice of the\npooling function has a great impact on the performance of\nthe system. In [7], feature pooling in the domain of visual\nrecognition is analyzed. The authors come to the conclu-\nsion that, depending on the data and features, neither max-\npooling or mean-pooling might be optimal, but something\nin between might be. This underlines the importance of a\nthorough analysis of pooling functions for the speciÔ¨Åc task\nof music audio classiÔ¨Åcation.\nThe choice of the temporal scale at which the pooling is\napplied also has a great impact on a system‚Äôs performance.\nIf we choose a time-scale that is too long, we discard too\nmuch information in the process, and the performance of\nthe system suffers. If we choose a time-scale that is too\nsmall, the representation becomes less compact and looses\nthe temporal shift invariance. It is possible to use onset\ndetection to determine an optimized aggregation window\nlength [20]. However, this method relies on onset detection\nmethods which are not always reliable in all types of music.\n2.3 Feature Learning and Deep Learning\nIt has been argued that features extracted by task-speciÔ¨Åc\nsignal processing might be replaced by features learned over\nsimpler low-level features, i.e., for object recognition [2,\n15]. For instance, features learned with a Deep Belief Net-\nwork over spectral amplitudes has been shown to outper-\nform MFCCs for genre recognition and automatic annota-\ntion [10, 16].Feature learning consists in exploiting the structure of the\ndata distribution to construct a new representation of the in-\nput. This representation can be considered as a set of la-\ntent variables within a probabilistic model of the input. The\ntransformation can be learned via unsupervised or super-\nvised learning. Feature learning allows one to build systems\nrelying less on prior knowledge and more on data, which\ngrants more Ô¨Çexibility to adapt to a given task.\nDeep learning algorithms attempt to discover multiple\nlevels of features or multiple levels of representation. Sev-\neral theoretical results and arguments [1] suggest that shal-\nlow architectures (with 1 or 2 levels, as in SVMs with a\nÔ¨Åxed kernel, for example) may be less efÔ¨Åcient at represent-\ning functions that can otherwise be represented compactly\nby a deep architecture. The advantage of a deep architecture\nis that concepts or features at one level can be represented\nby combining features at lower levels, and these low-level\nfeatures can be re-used in exponentially many ways as one\nconsiders deep architectures.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [15] were the Ô¨Årst\ndeep models to be applied successfully to real-world prob-\nlems such as character recognition. CNNs present a hier-\narchical structure. Inserting a feature pooling layer between\nconvolutional layers allows different layers of the network to\nwork at different time scales and introduces more and more\ntranslation invariance (as well as robustness to other kinds\nof local distortions) as one moves up the hierarchy of the\narchitecture. Hierarchical network structures such as CNNs\nseem ideal for representing music audio, since music also\ntends to present this hierarchical structure in time and dif-\nferent features of the music may be more salient at different\ntime scales. Thus, in Section 3.5.2, we propose a hierachical\nmodel strongly inspired by CNNs.\n3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n3.1 Magnatagatune Dataset\nThe Magnatagatune dataset consists of 29-second clips with\nannotations that were collected using an online game called\nTagATune. This dataset was used in the MIREX 2009 con-\ntest on audio tag classiÔ¨Åcation [14]. In our experiments, we\nused the same set of tags and the same train/test split as in\nthe contest. The training, valid and test set were composed\nof 14660, 1629 and 6499 clips respectively. The clips were\nannotated with a set of 160 tags, each clip being associated\nwith between 1 and 30 tags.\nWe describe here the systems used by the four best con-\ntestants: Marsyas [19], Mandel [17], Manzagol [18] and\nZhi [9]. All submissions use MFCCs as features, except\nfor Mandel, which instead uses a cepstral transform that is\nclosely related to MFCCs. Mandel also computes a set of\ntemporal features. In addition, Marsyas includes a set of\nspectral features: spectral centroid, rolloff and Ô¨Çux. Zhiuses Gaussian Mixture Models to obtain a song-level rep-\nresentation and uses a semantic multiclass labeling model.\nManzagol summarizes the features with vector quantization\n(VQ) and applies an algorithm called PAMIR (passive-aggressive\nmodel for image retrieval). Mandel trains balanced SVMs\nfor each tag. Finally, Marsyas uses running means and stan-\ndard deviations of the features as input to a two-stage SVM\nclassiÔ¨Åer.\n3.2 Performance evaluation\nTo evaluate the performance of our model, we compute the\nArea Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The ROC curve of a\nclassiÔ¨Åer is deÔ¨Åned by the ratio of true positives over the\npositive outputs in function of the ratio of false positives\nover the negative outputs. The AUC gives the probability\nthat, given one random positive and one random negative\nexample, the classiÔ¨Åer will rank the positive one higher than\nthe negative one. Since the AUC is deÔ¨Åned for a binary\nclassiÔ¨Åcation, and our task requires multi-label classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion, there are two ways we can compute the AUC. By com-\nputing the average of the AUC for each tag (AUC-tag), we\nobtain a global measure of how good a classiÔ¨Åer is at rank-\ning clips given a tag (e.g. Which clip is more ‚ÄôReggae‚Äô?).\nAlternatively, we can compute the average of the AUC for\neach clip (AUC-clip) to obtain a measure of how good clas-\nsiÔ¨Åer is at ranking tags for a given clip (e.g. Is this clip more\n‚Äôsad‚Äô or ‚Äômetal‚Äô ?).\nAnother measure which is closely related to the AUC is\nthe precision at kwhere kis an integer. Given an ordered list\nof tags for a clip, it is deÔ¨Åned by the ratio of true positives\nin the top kpositions.\n3.3 Audio Preprocessing\nOur audio preprocessing involves three steps: discrete Fourier\ntransform (DFT), mel-compression and principal component\nanalysis whitening (PCA).\nFirstly, to transform the audio in the spectral domain, we\ncompute DFTs over windows of 1024 samples on audio at\n22.1 KHz (i.e. roughly 46ms) with a frame step of 512 sam-\nples. Then, we run the spectral amplitudes through a set\nof 128 mel-scaled triangular Ô¨Ålters to obtain a set of spec-\ntral energy bands. We compute the principal components\nof a random sub-sample of the training set and throw away\nonly the components with very low variance (low eigenval-\nues), yielding 120 components in total. In order to obtain\nfeatures with unitary variance, we multiply each component\nby the inverse square root of its eigenvalue, a transforma-\ntion known as PCA whitening. We will refer to the pre-\nprocessed audio features as Principal Mel-Spectrum Com-\nponents (PMSC).3.4 Pooling functions\nIn our experiments, we used a set of pooling functions and\nsome of their combinations. The functions we used are:\nmean, variance (var), maximum (max), minimum (min), and\n3rd and 4th centered moments. The ith centered moment is\ndeÔ¨Åned by:1\nnPn\ni=1(x\u0000\u0016x)i. By this deÔ¨Ånition, the variance\ncorresponds to the second centered moment.\n3.5 Models\nWe used two different models in our experiments. The Ô¨Årst\none, described in Section 3.5.1, is a rather conventional sys-\ntem that applies feature extraction, pooling and classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion in three separate steps. The second one, described in\nSection 3.5.2, applies learning both before and after the tem-\nporal pooling. The models are illustrated in Figure 1.\n3.5.1 Pooled Features ClassiÔ¨Åer (PFC)\nThe Ô¨Årst model we evaluate applies a given set of pooling\nfunctions to the PMSC features, and sends the pooled fea-\ntures to a classiÔ¨Åer. Each pooling window is considered as a\ntraining example for the classiÔ¨Åer, and we average the pre-\ndictions of the classiÔ¨Åer over all the windows of a given clip\nto obtain the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation. The classiÔ¨Åer is a single\nhidden layer neural network, also known as multi-layer per-\nceptron (MLP). We used a hidden layer of 1000 units, sig-\nmoid activation, L2 weight decay and cross-entropy cost.\nWe chose to use the MLP as a classiÔ¨Åer for three main rea-\nsons. First, the hidden layer of the MLP should allow the\nmodel to learn dependencies between tags. Second, the MLP\ntraining time scales well (sub-linearly) with the size of the\ntraining set. Third, neural networks such as the MLP allows\ngreat Ô¨Çexibility in the structure of the network. This will al-\nlow us to extend the model to a multiscale structure, as we\nwill see in section 3.5.2. We will refer to this model as the\nPooled Features ClassiÔ¨Åer (PFC) model.\n3.5.2 Multi-Time-Scale Learning model (MTSL)\nThe second model is structurally similar to the Ô¨Årst one, ex-\ncept for the fact that we add a hidden layer between the in-\nput features and the pooling function. Thus the pooling is\nnow applied on the activation of this new hidden layer. In\nthis manner, the model is able to learn a representation of\nthe features to be pooled. The weights connecting the input\nto the Ô¨Årst layer are shared across all frames. We keep the\nsame MLP structure as in the PFC model on top of the pool-\ning. As for the PFC model, learning is purely supervised.\nDuring training, the error is back-propagated from the MLP,\nthrough the pooling functions, down to the Ô¨Årst hidden layer.\nThus, it is required to choose pooling functions for which a\ngradient can be deÔ¨Åned, which is the case for all the func-\ntions described in section 3.4.MLP\nPMSCUHidden Layer\n(learned frame-level features)\nPooled Features\nPoolingV\nMLP Hidden Layer\n(learned pool-level features)\nT ag predictions\nW\nMLP\nPMSC\nPooled Features\nPoolingV\nMLP Hidden Layer\n(learned pool-level features)\nT ag predictions\nWPFC Model MTSL ModelFigure 1 .Comparison of the PFC and the MTSL model.

Since this model learns on\ndifferent time scales, we will refer to it as the Multi-Time-\nScale Learning (MTSL) model.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe ran a few experiments to understand how much each\npiece of the puzzle contributes to the performance of the\nsystem. First, we evaluated how much the PCA step in\nthe preprocessing improves the input representation. Then,\nwe tested the performance of the system vs. the length of\nthe pooling window. Afterwards, we compared different\npooling functions and combined them for maximum per-\nformance. Finally, by adding a hidden layer to our model\nbefore the pooling, we trained a multiscale learning model.\nIn most experiments, we present the AUC-tag as our per-\nformance measure.

For this experiment, we Ô¨Åxed the pool-\ning window at about 2.3 seconds, following the results from\nSection 4.2. The results for different sets of pooling func-\ntions is given in Figure 4. We see that, once again, com-\nbining pooling functions gives better classiÔ¨Åcation perfor-\nmance. In particular, all the models that combined mean\nand max pooling tend to perform better than others. Also,\nvariance pooling seems to perform worse than other pool-\ning functions. It helps when combined with the mean, but it\ndoes not give any signiÔ¨Åcant improvement when combined\nwith max and min pooling.\nOne might think that models combining pooling func-\ntions would require more time to train. However, there was\nno signiÔ¨Åcant difference in training time for the differentpooling combinations, except for var andmean_var that\nrequired more time. This can be explained by the fact that,\neven though the number of pooled features is greater, the\ncombination of pooling functions allows the error informa-\ntion to Ô¨Çow better to the Ô¨Årst layer, thus facilitating learning.\nWe used between 100 and 200 units in the Ô¨Årst layer for\nthe experiments presented in Figure 4. Using more units\nfurther improves performance, but requires more computing\ntime. The best MTSL models used around 350 units.\n4.5 Comparative test performance\nWe compare the results of our models to those of the MIREX\n2009 contest1. In Table 2, we report the test performance\nof models that performed best on the validation dataset. We\nsee that, even without multiscale learning, PMSC features\nwith the PFC model outperform the best results from the\ncompetition. Applying multiscale learning gives an addi-\ntional boost to the performance.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have proposed a few improvements for au-\ntomatic annotation and ranking systems:\n\u000fWe introduced the PMSC features and demonstrated\ntheir performance.\n\u000fWe demonstrated how combining pooling functions\nhelps learning.\n\u000fWe proposed the MTSL model, adding multiscale struc-\nture in a deep architecture, and it obtains state-of-the-\nart performance.\nWe have demonstrated step-by-step the positive impact\nof each of these elements. These conclusions were demon-\nstrated on the task of automatic music annotation and rank-\ning, but may be transferable to other MIR task.\nThe MTSL model we proposed presents a relatively sim-\nple hierarchical structure. There are many ways that we\ncould still improve it further. For instance, using a deeper\nmodel with more time scales and smaller pooling windows\nmight allow to learn a better representation of the music\naudio. Also, applying unsupervised training would proba-\nbly improve the performance, especially for deeper models.\nFurthermore, the use of larger convolutional Ô¨Ålters instead\nof our frame-by-frame hidden-layer could allow a richer rep-\nresentation of time dynamics. Another possible improve-\nment would be to also use the time derivatives of the latent\nfeatures as features to be pooled.\nIt would also be interesting to apply our model to a larger\ndataset such as the Million Song Dataset [6] to test how well\nit scales to much larger music databases.\n1http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2009:Audio_\nTag_ClassiÔ¨Åcation_Tagatune_ResultsMeasure Manzagol Zhi Mandel Marsyas Mel-spec+PFC PMSC+PFC PSMC+MTSL\nAverage AUC-Tag 0.750 0.673 0.821 0.831 0.820 0.845 0.861\nAverage AUC-Clip 0.810 0.748 0.886 0.933 0.930 0.938 0.943\nPrecision at 3 0.255 0.224 0.323 0.440 0.430 0.449 0.467\nPrecision at 6 0.194 0.192 0.245 0.314 0.305 0.320 0.327\nPrecision at 9 0.159 0.168 0.197 0.244 0.240 0.249 0.255\nPrecision at 12 0.136 0.146 0.167 0.201 0.198 0.205 0.211\nPrecision at 15 0.119 0.127 0.145 0.172 0.170 0.175 0.181\nTable 2 .Performance of different models for the TagATune audio classiÔ¨Åcation task.

This paper introduces MEI as a document-encoding framework, and illustrates how it can be extended to encode new types of notation, eliminating the need for creating specialized and potentially incompatible notation encoding standards. 1. INTRODUCTION The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI)1 is a community-driven effort to define guidelines for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure. The MEI closely mirrors work done by text scholars in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)2 and while the two encoding initiatives are not formally related, they share many common characteristics and development practices. MEI, like TEI, is an umbrella term to simultaneously describe an organization, a research community, and a markup language [1]. It brings together specialists from various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is developed and maintained by the MEI Technical Group. The latest version of the MEI schema is scheduled for release in Fall 2011. The most ambitious feature of the 2011 release is the transformation of the MEI schema from a single, static XML schema language to an extensible and customizable music document-encoding framework. This framework approach gives individuals a platform on which to build custom schemas for encoding new types of music documents by adding features that support the unique aspects of these documents, while leveraging existing rules and guidelines in the MEI schema. This eliminates the                                                 1 http://www.music-encoding.org 2 http://www.tei-c.org 2 http://www.tei-c.org duplication of effort that comes with building entire encoding schemes from the ground up. In this paper we introduce the new tools and techniques available in MEI 2011. We start with a look at the current state of music document encoding techniques. Then, we discuss the theory and practice behind the customization techniques developed by the TEI community and how their application to MEI allows the development of new extensions that leverage the existing music document-encoding platform developed by the MEI community. We also introduce a new initiative for sharing these customizations, the MEI Incubator. Following this, we present a sample customization to illustrate how MEI can be extended to more accurately capture new and unique music notation sources. We then introduce two new software libraries written to allow application developers to add support for MEI-encoded notation. Finally, we end with a discussion on how this will transform the landscape for music notation encoding. 2. MUSIC NOTATION ENCODING There have been many attempts to create structural representations of music notation in machine-readable formats [2]. Some formats, like **kern or MuseData, use custom ASCII-based structures that are then parsed into machine-manipulable representations of music notation. Others, like NIFF or MIDI, use binary file formats. In recent years, XML has been the dominant platform for structural music encoding, employed by initiatives like MusicXML3 and IEEE15994.  The wide variety of encoding formats and approaches to music representation may be attributed to the complexity of music notation itself. Music notation often conveys meaning in multiple dimensions. Variations in placement on the horizontal or vertical axes manifest different dimensions in meaning, along with size, shape, colour, and spacing. To these, however, are added cultural and temporal dimensions that result in different types of music notation expressing different meanings through visually similar notation, depending on where and when that notation system was in use. This complexity prohibits the                                                 3 http://www.recordare.com/musicxml 4 http://www.mx.dico.unimi.it/index.php \n293Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\n   construction of a single, unified set of rules and theories about how music notation operates without encountering contradictions and fundamental incompatibilities between notation systems. Consequently, formulating a single, unified notation encoding scheme for representing the full breadth of music notation in a digital format becomes very difficult. As a result, representing music notation in a computer-manipulable format generally takes two approaches. The first approach is to identify the greatest amount of commonality among as many different types of music as possible, and target a general encoding scheme for all of them. The consequence is a widely accepted encoding scheme, which serves as a system that is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to represent common features among most musical documents, but extremely poor at representing the unique features that exist in every musical document. For example, the MIDI system of encoding pitch and timing as a stream of events functions very well if the only musical elements of interest are discrete volume, timing, and pitch values. It is, however, notoriously poor at representing features like phrase markings or distinctions between enharmonic pitch values. The second general approach is to build an encoding system that takes into account all the subtle variation and nuance that makes a particular form of music notation different from all others. With this approach, highly specialized methods for encoding the unique features of a given notation system may be designed and customized for a given set of users. The disadvantage, however, is that these systems are largely developed independent of each other, and may exhibit entirely incompatible ways of approaching notation encoding. This approach can be seen in many current encoding formats, where the choice to support the features of common music notation (CMN) in MusicXML, for example, creates a fundamental incompatibility with accurately capturing nuance in mensural notation. This is then addressed by developing entirely new encoding formats, such as the Computerized Mensural Music Editing (CMME) format5, specifically built to handle the unique features of mensural music but ultimately incompatible with other formats without the creation of lossy translators. This creates a highly fragmented music notation ecosystem, where software developers must choose which types of notation they can support in their applications and which ones are specifically out of scope. Earlier versions of the MEI schema focused on the second approach, initially built to represent CMN with all other systems declared out of scope. This led to a number of criticisms about its ability to accurately capture notation nuance; for example, Bradley and Vetch commented: ‚ÄúAlthough the scholarly orientation of the MEI markup scheme seemed extremely promising‚Ä¶considerable further                                                 5 http://www.cmme.org work would be needed to extend it so that it could appropriately express these very subtle notational differences‚Äù [3]. Later revisions of the MEI schema added support for different types of music notation, but still it was criticized for being unable to capture particular nuances in highly specialized repertoires. A pointed criticism of the representation of neumed notation in MEI was given in [4], which makes entirely valid points about the ability of a generalized notation encoding system to capture highly specific details about a particular notation type. There are inevitable commonalities between different systems of music notation, yet there are simply no universal commonalities across all systems of music notation. This suggests a possible third approach to the creation of music notation encoding schemes that has yet to be fully explored. This third approach exemplifies what we will call the ‚Äúframework‚Äù approach, where parties interested in supporting new types of notation can leverage existing description methods for common aspects of music notation documents, yet are able to extend this to cover unique aspects of a given repertoire. This allows developers to focus specifically on the features that make that music notation system unique, while still leveraging a large body of existing research and development in common encoding tasks. We call this the framework approach because it mirrors the use of software development frameworks, like Apple‚Äôs Cocoa framework6. A framework provides a large number of ‚Äúpre-packaged‚Äù methods designed to alleviate the burden of mundane and repetitive tasks, and allows application developers to focus on the features that make their application unique. It significantly reduces duplication of effort, and provides a platform that can easily be bug tested and re-used by many other people. The MEI 2011 Schema marks the first release where extension and customization can be very easily applied to the core set of elements to produce custom encoding systems that extend support for new types of musical documents. This has been accomplished by adopting the tools and development processes pioneered by the TEI community and will be discussed further in the next section. 3. TEI AND MEI: TOOLS AND CUSTOMIZATION The TEI was established to develop and maintain a set of standard practices and guidelines for encoding texts for the humanities. The scope of this project is extensive, but even with a comprehensive set of guidelines in place, there is a recognition that the guidelines developed by the core community do not cover all possible current or future use cases or applications for the TEI.                                                  6 http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/cocoa.html \n29412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   To address this, the TEI community has developed a process where custom TEI schemas may be generated through a formalized extension process. There is no single TEI schema or TEI standard [5]. The full set of TEI elements is arranged in 21 modules according to their utility in encoding certain features of a text (e.g., names and dates, drama, transcriptions of speech, and others). A customization definition file is then applied to the full set of elements specifying which features from these modules should be present in the output schema, and a custom schema for encoding a particular set of sources is generated by running the source and customization files through a processor.  The most powerful feature of this customization process is that new elements, attributes, or content models may be included in the customization definition, allowing the addition of new elements into the TEI that can address the differences presented by new types of documents. What this customization approach represents is the transition from a single, monolithic encoding schema to an extensible  \nTable 1: MEI core modules. document-encoding framework. Validation schemas for ensuring conformance with TEI guidelines can be dynamically generated from a central source and shared among other community members interested in encoding similar document types.  3.1 MEI as an encoding framework The MEI core is divided into 23 modules, each used to encapsulate unique characteristics of musical source encoding (Table 1). There are a total of 259 elements defined in the 2011 version of the MEI core, up from 238 in the 2010 release. The MEI core, like the TEI core, is expressed in an XML meta-schema language, the ‚ÄúOne Document Does-it-all‚Äù (ODD) format. The ODD meta-schema language provides developers with the facility for easily capturing encoding rules, grouping similar functionality into re-useable classes, and providing a central place for documentation, following a literate programming style. We use the term ‚Äúmeta-schema,‚Äù since it does not actually provide XML validation on its own, but provides MEI developers with the ability to express definitions of the MEI elements, the rules of how these elements may or may not be used, and their accompanying documentation. The Roma processor7 can then be used to create validation schemas expressed in three popular schema languages: RelaxNG (RNG), W3C Schema (XSD), and Document Type Definition (DTD).  (Of these three, RelaxNG is the preferred schema validation language for MEI). To generate these custom validation schemas, two ODD-encoded files are needed: the MEI core, containing all possible elements and maintained by the MEI Technical Group; and a customization file containing directives that specify the modules that should be activated in the resulting custom MEI schema. A complete set of HTML documentation may also be produced for a specific customization. This documentation includes usage guidelines for elements and their accompanying attributes, as well as automatically generated information about where a given element may or may not appear in a source tree. This process is illustrated in Figure 1. \nFigure 1: The MEI customization process. The most powerful feature of this system is that the ODD modification file allows for the definition of new elements and the re-definition or removal of core elements in the resulting schema. This functionality gives schema developers the ability to define extensions to MEI,                                                 7 http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/use_roma.xml Module Name Module content  MEI  MEI infrastructure  Shared  Shared components  Header  Common metadata  CMN  Common music notation  Mensural  Mensural music notation  Neumes  Neume notation  Analysis  Analysis and interpretation  CMNOrnaments  CMN ornamentation  Corpus  Metadata for music corpora  Critapp  Critical apparatus  Edittrans  Scholarly editions and interpretations  Facsimile  Facsimile documents  Figtable  Figures and tables  Harmony  Harmonic analysis  Linkalign  Temporal linking and alignment  Lyrics  Lyrics  MIDI  MIDI-like structures  Namesdates  Names and dates  Performance  Recorded performances  Ptrref  Pointers and references  Tablature  Basic tablature  Text  Narrative textual content  Usersymbols  Graphics, shapes and symbols  \n295Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\n   customizing the core set of elements to accurately capture nuance and unique features of a given repertoire or set of documents. These customizations may be targeted at specifically addressing the needs of these documents, building on and extending the base set of MEI elements. The customization functionality of MEI challenges the idea of building a common encoding system. The infinite and deep customization functionality available in the framework approach allows the development of incompatible ‚Äúdialects‚Äù of MEI. Does this actually represent an advance in music document encoding over a more fragmented encoding landscape with separate encoding initiatives focused on specific areas? While the creation of incompatible document-encoding systems is a possibility, we believe that there are specific advantages to the MEI and TEI approach, based on three assumptions about the nature of document-encoding languages and their development. The first assumption is that the developers of custom schemas want to address a perceived need for encoding a given musical document type, and typically do not want to reinvent entire document structures. Without a formal customization and extension process, however, developers of music encoding schemas have needed to construct entirely new encoding platforms from the ground up. The second assumption is that there are fewer encoding system developers than there are potential users of a given encoding system. A single developer who needs to develop a method of accurately capturing a given document type‚ÄîGerman lute tablature, for example‚Äîwill take the time to learn the customization process, while most encoding projects will be largely satisfied by the capabilities in the MEI core or pre-made and distributed customizations. Once a customization has been completed, that work can then be made available for others to use and extend, reducing further duplication of effort. Finally, the third assumption is that developing compatible encoding formats is a social and political process, as well as a technical one [6].  The TEI has addressed this by forming Special Interest Groups (SIGs) in which groups of individuals and organizations develop and propose extensions to the TEI core that deal with encoding specific types of documents, like correspondence and manuscripts. The fragmentation of an encoding language into incompatible dialects is not a technical problem, but one that can be addressed through discussion among stakeholders. The advantage that the customization approach brings to the process, however, is that it provides a common platform on which to base development and discussions. The customization tools allow a formalization of these discussions into a well-defined set of rules and guidelines. These assumptions have yet to be extensively scrutinized and only time and further discussion will tell if they accurately reflect reality. In the next section we will discuss a new MEI community initiative to allow developers to share their MEI extensions among other interested parties in an open development process. 3.2 The MEI Incubator The MEI Incubator was created to provide community members with a common space for developing and sharing their MEI extension customizations. Incubator projects are proposed by a Special Interest Group (SIG) from the community to address specific needs that members of the SIG feel are not adequately addressed in the MEI core. The Incubator website8 hosts a common code repository and documentation wiki. As Incubator projects mature, the SIG may then propose that the work of the SIG be incorporated into the MEI core as a new module, or an update to an existing module. An editorial committee will review the proposed extension for its suitability and ensure that the proposal does not duplicate existing functionality or create incompatibilities with existing MEI core modules.  The complexity of document encoding and the needs of communities to accurately describe sources may ultimately result in modifications that are fundamentally incompatible with the MEI core. While this means that it is unlikely that this extension will make it into the MEI core, the work done by the SIG can still be made available to others, making it possible to leverage a common platform to share existing work in specialized document encoding. Incubator projects are designed to be a means through which community members can participate in MEI development and propose new means and methods for musical document encoding. In the next section, we will demonstrate this process by examining a current Incubator project and illustrate how ODD modifications may be used to extend the MEI core. \nFigure 2: An example of the Solesmes neume notation showing a four-line staff, neumes, and divisions (vertical lines). 3.3 Sample Extension: The Solesmes Module The monks at Solesmes, France, were responsible for creating a large number of liturgical service books for the Catholic Church in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These books included missals, graduals and, perhaps most famously, the Liber Usualis [7], a book containing most of the chants for the daily offices and masses of the Catholic Church. These books were notated using a revival of 12th-century Notre Dame notation, featuring square note groups (neumes) on a four-line staff (Figure 2).                                                 8 http://code.google.com/p/mei-incubator \n \n29612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   There are a number of features of this particular type of notation that make it different from other types of earlier notation. Although MEI has included functionality for encoding neume notation since 2007, it was ultimately found to be insufficient for accurately capturing Solesmes-style neume notation for a project dedicated to automatically transcribing the contents of these books. Certain features, like divisions (similar, but not equivalent to breath marks, graphically represented by a vertical line across the staff), episema (note stresses) and Solesmes-specific neume names and forms were not present in the existing MEI core. A new Incubator project was proposed to address the need for an updated method of handling this type of neume notation. The ODD modification file created for this project defines four new elements for MEI, as well as their accompanying attributes. Due to space considerations we cannot reproduce the entire modification file, but we will illustrate the process by focusing on the method used to define the <division> element. We follow the convention of using angle brackets (<\t\r ¬†>) to identify XML elements, and the @ symbol to identify XML attributes.  <elementSpec ident=\"division\"      module=\"MEI.solesmes\" mode=\"add\">   <desc>Encodes the presence of a division          on a staff.</desc>   <classes>     <memberOf key=\"att.common\"/>     <memberOf key=\"att.facsimile\"/>     <memberOf key=\"att.solesmes.division\" />   </classes> </elementSpec> Figure 3: Declaration of the <division> element in ODD. This <elementSpec> definition (Figure 3) creates a new element, <division>, with the name specified in the @ident attribute. The @module attribute specifies the MEI module to which this element belongs, and the @mode attribute specifies the mode the Roma processor should use for this element. The @mode attribute may be one of ‚Äúadd,‚Äù for adding a new element, ‚Äúdelete,‚Äù for removing an existing element from the resulting schema, or ‚Äúreplace,‚Äù for re-defining an existing element (the ‚Äúdelete‚Äù and ‚Äúreplace‚Äù attribute use are not shown in Figure 3). The <desc> tags provide the documentation string for this element. The Roma processor will use this information to create the HTML documentation for the resulting schema customization. The <classes> element specifies the classes this element belongs to. In this case, the <division> element will automatically inherit the XML attributes specified in the att.common, att.facsimile, and att.solesemes.division classes. Of these three classes, two are defined in the MEI core while the third is declared elsewhere in the Solesmes ODD file. The <classSpec> declaration (Figure 4) creates a new class of attributes, att.solesmes.division. This class is used to define a new group of attributes that may be used on any element that is a member of this class; in this case, only the <division> element is a member of this class, but more general classes of attributes may be defined that apply to multiple XML elements (like the att.common class). The new @form attribute is declared by the <attDef> element. Additional attributes may be declared by creating more <attDef> children of the <attList> element. The @usage attribute on <attDef> declares this attribute to be optional, meaning that it is acceptable if a <division> element does not possess a @form attribute. Required attributes may be specified by setting this to ‚Äúreq.‚Äù \nFigure 4: Declaration of the att.solesmes.division class to describe a common attribute group. The <valList> element defines the possible values that the @form attribute may have; in this case the only valid values for the @form attribute are given by the <valItem> elements. Since the value list here is a closed set, any values supplied in the @form attribute that is not one of those specified will not pass validation. \nFigure 5: Valid and invalid use of the <division> element defined in the Solesmes module. These definitions will result in a schema that allows a <division> element in an MEI file, something that is not considered valid in unmodified MEI. Figure 5 llustrates valid and non-valid examples of this in practice. The full Solesmes module contains definitions for four new elements, <division>, <episema>, <neume>, and <nc> (neume component) and eight new attributes to accompany these elements. When this customization is processed with the Roma processor against the 2011 MEI core, a schema is produced that can be used to validate MEI instances. <division form=‚Äùcomma‚Äù /> Valid, @form can take comma as a value. <division /> Valid, @form is optional. <division form=‚Äùbell‚Äù /> Invalid, @form must be one of the specified values. <division name=‚Äùlong‚Äù /> Invalid, @name is not allowed on this element.  <classSpec ident=\"att.solesmes.division\"     type=\"atts\" mode=\"add\">   <desc>Divisions are breath and          phrasing indicators.</desc>   <attList>     <attDef ident=\"form\" usage=\"opt\">       <desc>Types of divisions.</desc>       <valList type=\"closed\">         <valItem ident=\"comma\" />         <valItem ident=\"major\" />         <valItem ident=\"minor\" />         <valItem ident=\"small\" />         <valItem ident=\"final\" />       </valList>     </attDef>   </attList> </classSpec> \n297Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\n   4. MEI SOFTWARE LIBRARIES For software developers looking to integrate MEI into their applications, we have developed two new software libraries to support reading and writing MEI files. Libmei is written in C++, and PyMEI is written in Python. Using object-oriented programming principles, these software libraries were designed to reflect the same modular structure as MEI, and are extensible by others to add support for new customizations. PyMEI 1.0 was developed as a rapid prototype for testing and designing a common API, which was then written in C++ as libmei. PyMEI 2.0, scheduled for release in Fall 2011, will adopt libmei as the base platform, unifying the two projects and serving as a reference implementation for the creation of MEI software libraries in other languages. Architecturally, every element in the MEI core is mirrored in the software libraries by a corresponding class‚Äîthe <note> element has a Note class, and so on. Every element class inherits from a base MeiElement class. This base class contains methods and attributes common to all MEI elements, like getting and setting names, values, child objects, and element attributes. Subclasses that inherit from this base class gain all of these functions. In the subclasses, however, are musical methods and attributes that are specific to the semantic function of that particular MEI element. For example, a Note class has get and set methods for pitch-related attributes, while a Measure class has methods for working with measure numbers. To extend this software, developers can easily add new classes to reflect new elements that they have added to an MEI customization. For example, a developer who wishes to support the <division> element specified in the Solesmes module would only need to create a Division class that inherits from the base MeiElement class, and then implement any methods that he or she wants to support for this class. For example, a developer may wish to add explicit getForm and setForm methods to set the @form attribute on the <division> element. The libmei and PyMEI projects are available as open source projects on GitHub9,10, licensed under the MIT license. 5. CONCLUSION With the 2011 release of the MEI Schema and the adoption of tools developed by the TEI project, MEI has moved beyond a static music document schema to an extensible document-encoding framework, providing developers with a formalized method of customizing and extending MEI to meet specific needs. An extensive set of elements and guidelines for creating valid MEI documents forms the core of MEI, but the complexity of music makes it impossible to anticipate every context in which users may want to use it.                                                 9 http://github.com/ahankinson/pymei 10 http://github.com/ddmal/libmei To help support and direct these efforts, we have created a new MEI community initiative, the MEI Incubator. This initiative will provide community members with a common space to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù their customizations and share them with other members of the community, reducing duplication of effort. As Incubator projects mature, they may be proposed as extensions to the MEI core, subject to editorial review, and finally adopted into the specification itself.  To support MEI in software applications, we are also releasing software libraries that assist developers with providing MEI import and export functionality. Currently we are targeting two common programming languages, C++ and Python, but we are also investigating support in other languages as well. MEI goes beyond simple notation encoding. It is a powerful platform for creating, sharing, storing, and analysing music documents. We are investigating methods of integrating MEI into optical music recognition platforms, as well as searching, analysing, and displaying MEI-encoded document facsimiles in a digital environment. 6.

INTRODUCTION\nOver the past several years much research has been devoted\nto designing feature extraction systems to address the many\nchallenging problems in music information retrieval (MIR).\nConsiderable progress has been made using task-dependent\nfeatures that rely on hand-crafted signal processing tech-\nniques (see [13] and [26] for reviews). An alternative ap-\nproach is to use features that are instead learned automat-\nically. This has the advantage of generalizing well to new\ntasks, particularly if the features are learned in an unsuper-\nvised manner.\nSeveral systems to automatically learn useful features from\ndata have been proposed over the years. Recently, Restricted\nBoltzmann Machines (RBMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)\nand sparse coding (SC) algorithms have enjoyed a good deal\nof attention in the computer vision community. These have\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.led to solid and state-of-the-art results on several object recog-\nnition benchmarks [8, 15, 23, 30].\nSome of these methods have also began receiving inter-\nest as means to automatically learn features from audio data.\nThe authors of [22] explored the use of sparse coding using\nlearned dictionaries in the time domain, for the purposes of\ngenre recognition. Convolutional DBNs were used in [16]\nto learn features from speech and music spectrograms in an\nunsupervised manner. Using a similar method, but with su-\npervised Ô¨Åne-tuning, the authors in [12] were able to achieve\n84.3% accuracy on the Tzanetakis genre dataset, which is\none of the best reported results to date.\nDespite their theoretical appeal, systems to automatically\nlearn features also bring a speciÔ¨Åc set of challenges. One\ndrawback of DBNs noted by the authors of [12] were their\nlong training times, as well as the large number of hyper-\nparameters to tune. Furthermore, several authors using sparse\ncoding algorithms have found that once the dictionary is\nlearned, inferring sparse representations of new inputs can\nbe slow, as it usually relies on some kind of iterative proce-\ndure [14, 22, 30]. This in turn can limit the real-time appli-\ncations or scalability of the system.\nIn this paper, we investigate a sparse coding method called\nPredictive Sparse Decomposition (PSD) [11, 14, 15] that at-\ntempts to automatically learn useful features from audio data,\nwhile addressing some of these drawbacks. Like many sparse\ncoding algorithms, it involves learning a dictionary from a\ncorpus of unlabeled data, such that new inputs can be rep-\nresented as sparse linear combinations of the dictionary‚Äôs\nelements. It differs in that it also trains an encoder that ef-\nÔ¨Åciently maps new inputs to approximations of their opti-\nmal sparse representations using the learned dictionary. As\na result, once the dictionary is learned inferring the sparse\nrepresentations of new inputs is very efÔ¨Åcient, making the\nsystem scalable and suitable for real-time applications.\n2. THE ALGORITHM\n2.1 Sparse Coding Algorithms\nThe main idea behind sparse coding is to express signals\nx‚ààRnas sparse linear combinations of basis functions\n681Poster Session 6\nchosen out of an overcomplete set. Letting B‚ààRn√óm\n(n < m )denote the matrix consisting of basis functions\nbj‚ààRnas columns with weights z= (z1,...,zm), this\nrelationship can be written as:\nx=m/summationdisplay\njzjbj=Bz (1)\nwhere most of the zi‚Äôs are zero. Overcomplete sparse\nrepresentations tend to be good features for classiÔ¨Åcation\nsystems, as they provide a succinct representation of the sig-\nnal, are robust to noise, and are more likely to be linearly\nseparable due to their high dimensionality.\nDirectly inferring the optimal sparse representation zof\na signal xgiven a dictionary Brequires a combinatorial\nsearch, intractable in high dimensional spaces. Therefore,\nvarious alternatives have been proposed. Matching Pursuit\nmethods [21] offer a greedy approximation to the solution.\nAnother popular approach, called Basis Pursuit [7], involves\nminimizing the loss function:\nLd(x,z,B) =1\n2||x‚àíBz||2\n2+Œª||z||1 (2)\nwith respect to z. HereŒªis a hyper-parameter setting the\ntradeoff between accurate approximation of the signal and\nsparsity of the solution. It has been shown that the solu-\ntion to (2) is the same as the optimal solution, provided it\nis sparse enough [10]. A number of works have focused on\nefÔ¨Åciently solving this problem [1, 7, 17, 20], however they\nstill rely on a computationally expensive iterative procedure\nwhich limits the system‚Äôs scalability and real-time applica-\ntions.\n2.2 Learning Dictionaries\nIn classical sparse coding, the dictionary is composed of\nknown functions such as sinusoids, gammatones, wavelets\nor Gabors. One can also learn dictionaries that are adaptive\nto the type of data at hand. This is done by Ô¨Årst initializing\nthe basis functions to random unit vectors, and then iterating\nthe following procedure:\n1. Get a sample signal xfrom the training set\n2. Calculate its optimal sparse code z‚àóby minimizing\n(2) with respect to z. Simple optimization methods\nsuch as gradient descent can be used, or more sophis-\nticated approaches such as [1, 7, 20].\n3.

Shrinkage function with Œ∏= 1\nThere is evidence that sparse coding could be a strategy\nemployed by the brain in the early stages of visual and audi-\ntory processing. The authors in [24] found that basis func-\ntions learned on natural images using the above procedure\nresembled the receptive Ô¨Åelds in the visual cortex. In an\nanalogous experiment [28], basis functions learned on nat-\nural sounds were found to be highly similar to gammatone\nfunctions, which have been used to model the action of the\nbasilar membrane in the inner ear.\n2.3 Predictive Sparse Decomposition\nIn order to avoid the iterative procedure typically required\nto infer sparse codes, several works have focused on de-\nveloping nonlinear, trainable encoders which can quickly\nmap inputs to approximations of their optimal sparse codes\n[11, 14, 15]. The encoder‚Äôs architecture is denoted z=\nfe(x,U), where xis an input signal, zis an approxima-\ntion of its sparse code, and Ucollectively designates all the\ntrainable parameters of the encoder. Training the encoder\nis performed by minimizing the encoder loss Le(x,U), de-\nÔ¨Åned as the squared error between the predicted code zand\nthe optimal sparse code z‚àóobtained by minimizing (2), for\nevery input signal xin the training set:\nLe(x,U) =1\n2||z‚àó‚àífe(x,U)||2(3)\nSpeciÔ¨Åcally, the encoder is trained by iterating the fol-\nlowing process:\n1. Get a sample signal xfrom the training set and com-\npute its optimal sparse code z‚àóas described in the pre-\nvious section.\n2. Keeping z‚àóÔ¨Åxed, update Uwith one step of stochas-\ntic gradient descent: U‚ÜêU‚àíŒΩ‚àÇLe\n‚àÇU, whereLeis\nthe loss function in (3).\nIn this paper, we adopt a simple encoder architecture\ngiven by:\nfe(x,W,b) =hŒ∏(Wx +b) (4)\nwhere Wis a Ô¨Ålter matrix, bis a vector of trainable bi-\nases andhŒ∏is the shrinkage function given by hŒ∏(x)i=\n68212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nsgn(xi)(|xi|‚àíŒ∏i)+(Figure 1). The shrinkage function sets\nany code components below a certain threshold Œ∏to zero,\nwhich helps ensure that the predicted code will be sparse.\nTraining the encoder is done by iterating the above process,\nwithU={W,b,Œ∏}. Note that once the encoder is trained,\ninferring sparse codes is very efÔ¨Åcient, as it essentially re-\nquires a single matrix-vector multiplication.\n3. LEARNING AUDIO FEATURES\nIn this section we describe the features learned on music\ndata using PSD.\n3.1 Dataset\nWe used the GTZAN dataset Ô¨Årst introduced in [29], which\nhas since been used in several works as a benchmark for\nthe genre recognition task [2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 25]. The dataset\nconsists of 1000 30-second audio clips, each belonging to\none of 10 genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop,\njazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock. The classes are balanced\nso that there are 100 clips from each genre. All clips are\nsampled at 22050 Hz.\n3.2 Preprocessing\nTo begin with, we divided each clip into short frames of\n1024 samples each, corresponding to 46.4ms of audio. There\nwas a 50% overlap between consecutive frames. We then\napplied a Constant-Q transform (CQT) to each frame, with\n96 Ô¨Ålters spanning four octaves from C 2to C 6at quarter-\ntone resolution. For this we used the toolbox provided by\nthe authors of [27]. An important property of the CQT is\nthat the center frequencies of the Ô¨Ålters are logarithmically\nspaced, so that consecutive notes in the musical scale are\nlinearly spaced. We then applied subtractive and divisive\nlocal contrast normalization (LCN) as described in [15],\nwhich consisted of two stages. First, from each point in the\nCQT spectrogram we subtracted the average of its neigh-\nborhood along both the time and frequency axes, weighted\nby a Gaussian window. Each point was then divided by the\nstandard deviation of the new neighborhood, again weighted\nby a Gaussian window. This enforces competition between\nneighboring points in the spectrogram, so that low-energy\nsignals are ampliÔ¨Åed while high-energy ones are muted. The\nentire process can be seen as a simple form of automatic\ngain control.\n3.3 Features Learned on Frames\nWe then learned dictionaries on all frames in the dataset, us-\ning the process described in 2.2. The dictionary size was\nset to 512, so as to get overcomplete representations. Once\nthe dictionary was learned, we trained the encoder to pre-\ndict sparse representations using the process in 2.3. In both\nFigure 2 . A random subset of the 512 basis functions\nlearned on full CQT frames. The horizontal axis represents\nlog-frequency and ranges from 67 Hz to 1046 Hz.\ncases, we used the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding al-\ngorithm (FISTA) [1] to compute optimal sparse codes. Some\nof the learned basis functions are displayed in Figure 2. One\ncan see single notes and what appear to be series of linearly\nspaced notes, which could correspond to chords, harmonics\nor harmonies. Note that some of the basis functions appear\nto be inverted, since the code coefÔ¨Åcients can be negative.\nA number of the learned basis functions also seem to have\nlittle recognizable structure.\n3.4 Features Learned on Octaves\nWe also tried learning separate dictionaries on each of the\nfour octaves, in order to capture local frequency patterns.\nTo this end we divided each frame into four octaves, each\nconsisting of 24 channels, and learned dictionaries of size\n128 on each one. We then trained four separate encoders\nto predict the sparse representations for each of the four oc-\ntaves. Some of the learned basis functions are shown in Fig-\nure 3. Interestingly, we Ô¨Ånd that a number of basis functions\ncorrespond to known chords or intervals: minor thirds, per-\nfect Ô¨Åfths, sevenths, major triads, etc. A number of basis\nfunctions also appear to be similar versions of each other\nshifted across frequency. Other functions have their en-\nergy spread out across frequency, which could correspond\n683Poster Session 6\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 3 .

In the case of dictio-\nnaries learned on individual octaves, for each frame we con-\ncatenated the sparse representations of each of its four oc-\ntaves, all of length 128, into a single vector of size 512. Ex-\ntracting sparse features for the entire dataset, which contains\nover 8 hours of audio, took less than 3 minutes, which shows\nthat this feature extraction system is scalable to industrial-\nsize music databases.\n4. CLASSIFICATION USING LEARNED FEATURES\nWe now describe the results of using our learned features\nas inputs for genre classiÔ¨Åcation. We used a linear Support\nVector Machine (SVM) as a classiÔ¨Åer, using the LIBSVM\nlibrary [5]. Linear SVMs are fast to train and scale well to\nlarge datasets, which is an important consideration in MIR.\n4.1 Aggregated Features\nSeveral authors have found that aggregating frame-level fea-\ntures over longer time windows substantially improves clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation performance [2, 3, 12]. Adopting a similar ap-\nproach, we computed aggregate features for each song by\nsumming up sparse codes over 5-second time windows over-\nlapping by half. We applied absolute value rectiÔ¨Åcation to\nthe codes beforehand to prevent components of different\nsign from canceling each other out. Since each sparse code\nrecords which dictionary elements are present in a given\nCQT frame, these aggregate feature vectors can be thought\nof as histograms recording the number of occurrences of\neach dictionary element in the time window.\n4.2 ClassiÔ¨Åcation\nTo produce predictions for each song, we voted over all ag-\ngregate feature vectors in the song and chose the genre with\nthe highest number of votes. Following standard practice,\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance was measured by 10-fold cross-\nvalidation. For each fold, 100 songs were randomly selected\nto serve as a test set, with the remaining 900 serving as train-\ning data. This procedure was repeated 10 times, and the re-\nsults averaged to produce a Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy.\nOur classiÔ¨Åcation results, along with several other results\nfrom the literature, are shown in Figure 4.

Our results with standard deviations\nare marked in bold.\nour approach outperforms many existing systems which use\nhand-crafted features. The two systems that signiÔ¨Åcantly\noutperform our own rely on sophisticated classiÔ¨Åers based\non sparse representations (SRC) or compressive sampling\n(CSC). The fact that our method is still able to reach compet-\nitive performance while using a simple classiÔ¨Åer indicates\nthat the features learned were able to capture useful proper-\nties of the audio that distinguish between genres. One possi-\nble interpretation is that some of the basis functions depicted\nin Figure 3 represent chords speciÔ¨Åc to certain genres. For\nexample, perfect Ô¨Åfths (e.g. power chords) are very com-\nmon in rock, blues and country, but rare in jazz, whereas\nquartal chords, which are common in jazz and classical, are\nseldom found in rock or blues.\n4.3 Discussion\nOur results show that automatic feature learning is a viable\nalternative to using hand-crafted features. Our approach per-\nformed better than most systems that pair signal processing\nfeature extractors with standard classiÔ¨Åers such as SVMs,\nNearest Neighbors or Gaussian Mixture Models. Another\npositive point is that our feature extraction system is very\nfast, and the use of a simple linear SVM makes this method\nviable on any size dataset. Furthermore, the fact that the fea-\ntures are learned in an unsupervised manner means that they\nare not limited to a particular task, and could be used for\nother MIR tasks such as chord recognition or autotagging.\nWe also found that features learned on octaves performed\nbetter than features learned on entire frames. This could be\ndue to the fact that in the second case we are learning four\ntimes as many parameters as in the Ô¨Årst, which could lead\nto overÔ¨Åtting. Another possibility is that features learned on\noctaves tend to capture relationships between fundamental\nnotes, whereas features learned on entire frames also seem\nnot yield an increase in accuracy.to capture patterns between fundamentals and their harmon-\nics, which could be less useful for distinguishing between\ngenres.\nOne aspect that needs mentioning is that since we per-\nformed the unsupervised feature learning on the entire dataset\n(which includes the training and test sets without labels for\neach of the cross-validation folds), our system is technically\nakin to ‚Äútransductive learning‚Äù. Under this paradigm, test\nsamples are known in advance, and the system is simply\nasked to produce labels for them. We subsequently con-\nducted a single experiment in which features were learned\non the training set only, and obtained an accuracy of 80%.\nThough less than our overall accuracy, this result is still\nwithin the range observed during the 10 different cross-validation\nexperiments, which went from 77% to 87%. The seemingly\nlarge deviation in accuracy is likely due to the variation of\nclass distributions between folds.\nThere are a number of directions in which we would like\nto extend this work. A Ô¨Årst step would be to apply our sys-\ntem to different MIR tasks, such as autotagging. Further-\nmore, the small size of the GTZAN dataset does not ex-\nploit the system‚Äôs ability to leverage large amounts of data\nin a tractable amount of time. For this, the Million Song\nDataset [4] would be ideal.\nA limitation of our system is that it ignores temporal de-\npendencies between frames. A possible remedy would be\nto learn features on time-frequency patches instead. Pre-\nliminary experiments we conducted in this direction did not\nyield improved results, as many ‚Äôlearned‚Äô basis functions\nresembled noise. This requires further investigation. We\ncould also try training a second layer of feature extractors\non top of the Ô¨Årst, since a number of works have demon-\nstrated that using multiple layers can improve classiÔ¨Åcation\nperformance [12, 15, 16].\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have investigated the ability for PSD to\nautomatically learn useful features from constant-Q spec-\ntrograms. We found that the features learned capture infor-\nmation about which chords are being played in a particular\nframe. Furthermore, these learned features can perform at\nleast as well as hand-crafted features for the task of genre\nrecognition. Finally, the system we proposed is fast and uses\na simple linear classiÔ¨Åer which scales well to large datasets.\nIn future work, we will apply this method to larger datasets,\nas well as a wider range of MIR tasks. We will also exper-\niment with different ways of capturing temporal dependen-\ncies between frames. Finally, we will investigate using hi-\nerarchical systems of feature extractors to learn higher-level\nfeatures.\n685Poster Session 6\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] A.

INTRODUCTION\nAs users accumulate digital music in their digital devices,\nthe problem arises for them to manage the large number of\ntracks in them. If a device contains thousands of tracks, it\nis difÔ¨Åcult, painful, and even impractical for a user to pick\nsuitable tracks to listen to without using pre-determined or-\nganization such as albums, playlists or computationally gen-\nerated recommendation, which is the topic of this paper.\nA good recommendation system should be able to min-\nimize user‚Äôs effort required to provide feedback and simul-\ntaneously to maximize the user‚Äôs satisfaction by playing ap-\npropriate song at the right time. Reducing the amount of\nfeedback is an important point in designing recommenda-\ntion systems, since users are in general lazy. We thus evalu-\nate user‚Äôs attitude towards a song from partitioning of play-\ning time. In particular, if a song is played from beginning\nto end, we infer that the user likes the song and it is a sat-\nisfying recommendation. On the other hand, if the song is\nskipped while just lasting a few seconds, we assume that the\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.user dislikes the song at that time and the recommendation\nis less effective.\nUsing this idea we propose a method to automatically\nrecommend music in a user‚Äôs device as the next song to be\nplayed. In order to keep short the computation time for rec-\nommendation, the method is based on metadata and user be-\nhavior rather than on content analysis. Which song should\nbe played next can be determined based on various factors.\nIn this paper, we use Ô¨Åve perspectives: genre, year, favor,\nfreshness and time pattern.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,\nwe introduce recent related work. In Section 3 we describe\nour method for calculating recommendation. We will eval-\nuate this method in Section 4. We conclude by discussing\npossible future work in Section 5.\n2. RELATED WORK\nVarious song recommendation approaches have been devel-\noped so far. We can categorize these approaches in different\nviews.\nAutomatical playlist generation focuses on recommend-\ning songs that are similar to chosen seeds to generate a new\nplaylist. Ragno [1] provided an approach to recommend\nmusic that is similar to chosen seeds as a playlist. Sim-\nilarly, Flexer [2] provided a sequence of songs to form a\nsmooth transition from a start song till the end song. These\napproaches ignore user‚Äôs feedback when the user listens to\nthe songs in the playlist. They have an underlying problem\nthat all seed-based approaches produce excessively uniform\nlists of songs if the dataset contains lots of music cliques.\nIn iTunes, Genius employs similar methods to generate a\nplaylist from a seed.\nDynamic music recommendation improves automatic play-\nlist generation by considering the user‚Äôs feedback. In the\nmethod proposed by Pampalk [3], playlist generation starts\nwith an arbitrary song and adjusts the recommendation re-\nsult based on user feedback. This type of method is similar\nto Pandora.\nCollaborative-Ô¨Ålter methods recommend pieces of music\nto a user based on rating of those pieces by other users with\n103Poster Session 1\nsimilar taste [4]. However, collaborative methods require\nmany users and many ratings and are unable to recommend\nsongs that have no ratings. Hence, users have to be well rep-\nresented in terms of their taste if they need effective recom-\nmendation. This principle has been used by various social\nwebsites, including Last.fm, myStrands.\nContent-based methods computes similarity between songs,\nrecommends songs similar to the favorite songs, and re-\nmoves songs that are similar to the skipped songs. In an\napproach proposed by Cano [5], acoustic features of songs\nare extracted, such as timbre, tempo, meter and rhythm pat-\nterns. Furthermore, some work expresses similarity accord-\ning to songs emotion. Cai [6] recommends music based only\non emotion.\nHybrid approaches , which combine music content and\nother information, are receiving more attention lately. Don-\naldson [7] leverages both spectral graph properties of an\nitem-base collaborative Ô¨Åltering as well as acoustic features\nof the music signal. Shao et al. [8] use both content features\nand user access pattern to recommend music.\nContext-based methods take context into consideration.\nLiu et al. [9] take the change in the interests of users over\ntime into consideration and add time scheduling to the mu-\nsic playlist. Su et al. [10] improve collaborative Ô¨Åltering us-\ning user grouping by context information, such as location,\nmotion, calendar, environment conditions and health condi-\ntions, while using content analysis assists system to select\nappropriate songs.\n3. METHOD\nWe determine whether a song is to be recommended as the\nnext one in the playlist from Ô¨Åve perspectives: genre, year,\nfavor, freshness and time pattern.\nWe use time series analysis of genre and year to predict\nthese attributes of the next song rather than to select the song\nwith similar genre and year to the current song. The reason\nis that some users like listening similar songs according to\ngenre and year while others perhaps love mixing songs and\nthe variance on genre and year. Hence, we cannot assume\nthat a similar song to the current one can be reasonably seen\nas a good choice for recommendation. Prediction using time\nseries analysis caters better to a user‚Äôs taste.\nObviously, the system should recommend users‚Äô favorite\nsongs to them. How many times a song has been actively\nplayed and how many times the song has been completely\nplayed can be used to infer the strength of favor to the song.\nWe collected user‚Äôs behavior to analyze the favor of songs.\nIn common sense, a few users dislike listening to a song\nmany times in a short period of times, even though the song\ncould be the user‚Äôs favorite. On the other hand, some songs\nthat the user favored many months ago may be now old and\na little bit insipid. However, if the system recommend them\nFigure 1 . Genre taxonomy screenshot in AllMusic.com\nat right time, the user may feel it is fresh and enjoy the expe-\nrience. Consequently, we take freshness of songs into con-\nsideration.\nDue to activities and biological clock, users have differ-\nent tastes in choosing music. In a different period of a day\nor a week, users tend to select different styles of songs. For\nexample, in the afternoon, a user may like a soothing kind\nof music for relaxation and may switch to energetic songs\nin the evening. This paper uses a Gaussian Mixture Model\nto represent the time pattern of listening and compute the\nprobability of playing a song at that time.\n3.1 Genre\nThe sequence of recent playing of a user represents the user‚Äôs\nhabit of listening so we analyze the playing sequence us-\ning a time series analysis method to predict the genre of the\nnext song. The system records recent 16 songs that were\nplayed for at least a half of their length. Although most\nof the songs record their genres and years are available in\nID3v1 or ID3v2 tags, a part of tags are notoriously noisy.\nHence, we developed a web wrapper to collect genre in-\nformation from AllMusic.com, a popular music information\nwebsite, and use that information to retrieve songs‚Äô genres.\nThe ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags will be used unless AllMusic.com\nhas no information about the song.\nFurthermore, AllMusic.com not only has a hierarchical\ntaxonomy on genre but also provides subgenres with re-\nlated genres. The hierarchical taxonomy and related gen-\nres are shown in Figure 1. For example, Industrial\nMetal , whose parent is Alternative Metal , is re-\nlated to Alternative Pop/Rock .\nWe use the taxonomy to build an undirected distance graph,\nin which each node describes a genre and each edge‚Äôs value\nis the distance between two genres. The values of the graph\nare initialized by a maximum value. The parent and related\nrelationship are valued at a different distance, which varies\nby the depth in the taxonomy, that is, high level corresponds\nto larger distance while low level corresponds to smaller dis-\ntance. Then, we assume the distance is transitive and update\nthe distance graph as follows until there is no cell update.\n10412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nEij= min\nk(Eij,Eik+Ekj), (1)\nwhereEijis the value of edge (i,j). Therefore, we obtain\nthe similarity between any two kinds of genre and the max-\nimum value in the matrix is 6.\nNow, the system converts the series of genres of recent\nsongs into a series of similarity between neighbor genres\nusing the similarity matrix. The series of similarity will be\nseen as the input for time series analysis method and we can\nestimate the next similarity. Then, the current genre and the\nestimated similarity will give us genre candidates.\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [11]\nmodel is a general class of models in time series analysis.\nAn ARIMA( p,d,q ) model can be expressed by following\npolynomial factorization.\nŒ¶ (B) (1‚àíB)dyt=Œ¥+ Œò (B)Œµt (2)\nŒ¶ (B) = 1‚àíp/summationdisplay\ni=1œÜiBi(3)\nŒò (B) = 1 +q/summationdisplay\ni=1Œ∏iBi(4)\n,whereytis thetth value in the time series of data YandB\nis the lag operator; œÜandŒ∏are the parameters of the model,\nwhich are calculated in analysis; pandqare orders of au-\ntoregressive process and moving average process, respec-\ntively; Anddis a unitary root of multiplicity.\nThe Ô¨Årst step of building ARIMA model is model identi-\nÔ¨Åcation, namely, estimating p,dandqby analyzing obser-\nvations in time series. Model identiÔ¨Åcation is beneÔ¨Åcial to\nÔ¨Åt the different pattern of time series. The second step is\nto estimate parameters of the model. Then, the model can\nbe applied to forecast the value at t+œÑ, forœÑ >0. As an\nillustration consider forecasting the ARIMA( 1,1,1) process\n(1‚àíœÜB) (1‚àíB)yt+œÑ= (1‚àíŒ∏B)Œµt+œÑ (5)\nÀÜŒµt=yt‚àí/bracketleftBigg\nŒ¥+p+d/summationdisplay\ni=1œÜiyt‚àíi‚àíq/summationdisplay\ni=1Œ∏iÀÜŒµt‚àíi/bracketrightBigg\n(6)\nOur system uses ARIMA to Ô¨Åt the series of similarity\nand to predict the next similarity. The process is shown in\nFigure 2.\nWe use Gaussian distributions to evaluate each possible\ngenre for the next track. We select the one with the biggest\nprobability.\n3.2 Recording year\nThe recording year is similar to genre so we use ARIMA to\npredict the next possible year and compute the probability\nof a recording year.\nFigure 2 . Predict the next genre\n3.3 Freshness\nAs a new feature of this paper, we take into consideration\nfreshness of a song to a user. Many recommendation sys-\ntems [12] based on metadata of music and user behavior\ncannot avoid to recommend same music under same situa-\ntions. As a result, a small set of songs will be recommended\nagain and again. What‚Äôs worse is that these songs will still\nbe at the top of recommendation result since they have been\nrecommended and played many times and then are seen as\nfavorite songs. The iteration makes users fall into a ‚Äúfavorite\ntrap‚Äù and feel bored. Therefore, an intelligent recommenda-\ntion system should avoid to recommend same set of songs\nmany times in a short period. On the other hand, the system\nis supposed to recommend some songs that have not been\nplayed for a long time because these songs are fresh to users\neven though they once listened to them multiple times.\nFreshness can be considered as the strength of strangeness\nor the amount of experience forgotten. We apply Forgetting\nCurve [13] to evaluate the freshness of a song to a user. For-\ngetting Curve is shown as follows.\nR=e‚àít\nS, (7)\nwhereRis memory retention, Sis the relative strength of\nmemory and tis time.\nThe lesser the amount of memory retention of a song in a\nuser‚Äôs mind, the fresher the song to the user. In our work, S\nis deÔ¨Åned as the number of times the song has been played\nandtis the distance of present time to the last time the song\nwas played. The reciprocal of memory retention is normal-\nized to represent the freshness.\nThis metric contributes towards selecting fresh songs as\nrecommendation results rather than recommending a small\nset of songs repetitively.\n3.4 Favor\nThe strength of favor for a song plays an important role in\nrecommendation. In playing songs, the system should give\npriority to user‚Äôs favorite songs. User behavior can be im-\nplied to estimate how favored the user feels about the song\nbased on a simple assumption: A user listens to a favorite\nsong more often many an unfavorite song and on average\nlistens to a larger fraction of the favorite song than the other.\nWe consider the favor of a song from four counts: ac-\ntive play times, passive play times, skip times and delete\n105Poster Session 1\ntimes. Passive play time means the song is played as a rec-\nommendation result or as the next one in playlist. The favor\nis assessed by the weighted average of the four factors.\n3.5 Time pattern\nSince users have different habits or tastes in different peri-\nods of a day or a week, our recommendation system takes\ntime pattern into consideration based on user log. The sys-\ntem records the time of the day and week that songs are\nplayed. It then employs Gaussian Mixture Model to esti-\nmate the probability of playing at a speciÔ¨Åc time. The play-\ning times of a song in different periods trains the model us-\ning Expectation Maximization algorithm. When the system\nrecommends songs, the model is used to estimate the prob-\nability of the song being played at that time.\n3.6 Integrate into Ô¨Ånal score\nA song is assessed whether it is a Ô¨Åt for recommendation\nas the next song from the Ô¨Åve perspectives described in the\nabove. In order to rank results and make a selection, the\nscores should be integrated into a Ô¨Ånal score. At Ô¨Årst, the\nscores are normalized into the same scale. Since different\nusers have different tastes, these Ô¨Åve factors are assigned\ndifferent weights at integration. Hence, we refer to Gradi-\nent Descent in order to match users‚Äô need. However, it is not\nuser friendly to offer too many possible recommendation re-\nsults and determine how to descent based on user‚Äôs interac-\ntion. We use the recent recommendation results to adjust the\nweights, which is initialized by (1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0). The\nalgorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.\n3.7 Cold start\nCold start is a difÔ¨Åcult problem to tackle for recommenda-\ntion system. When a recommendation system begins with\nno idea as to what kinds of songs users like or dislike, it\nhardly gives any valuable recommendation. As a result, in\nthe cold start, the system randomly picks a song as the next\nsong and records the user‚Äôs interaction, which is similar to\nPampalk‚Äôs work [3]. After 16 songs has been played, the\nsystem uses the metadata of these songs and user behavior\nto recommend a song as the next one.\n4. EXPERIMENT\nThe goal of the recommendation system is to cater to users‚Äô\ntaste and recommend the next song at the right time and in\nthe right order. Therefore, here, we focus on the user expe-\nrience and compare users‚Äô satisfaction between our method\nand a baseline method, which randomly picks a song as the\nnext one. We notice that most of the songs in a user‚Äôs de-\nvice are their favorite, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that every songALGORITHM 1: Adjust weights based on recent rec-\nommendation results\nInput: Recentkrecommendation results\n/Rfracturt(Rt‚àík+1,Rt‚àík+2,...,Rt‚àí1,Rt)at timet.\nRicontains user interaction of this recommendation\nœái, which is like ordislike , and the score of each\nfactor of the recommendation iisŒõi.\nDescent step Œ¥, which is positive.\nCurrent factor weights, W.\nOutput: New factor weights, W/prime.\nProcess:\nifœát=dislike then\nInitialize an array Fto record the contribution of\neach factor.\nfori=Rt‚àík+2toRtdo\n‚àÜŒõi=Œõi‚àíŒõi‚àí1\nmax = arg max\nj(‚àÜŒªj),1‚â§j‚â§5\nmin = arg min\nj(‚àÜŒªj)\nifœái=Like then\nFmax=Fmax+ 1\nend\nelse\nFmax=Fmax‚àí2\nFmin=Fmin+ 1\nend\nend\ninIndex = arg max\nj(F)\nw/prime\nj=/braceleftbiggwj+Œ¥,j=inIndex\nwj‚àíŒ¥/4,otherwise,j= 1,2,3,4,5\ndeIndex = arg min\ni(F)\nw/prime\nj=/braceleftbiggwj‚àíŒ¥,j=deIndex\nwj+Œ¥/4,otherwise,j= 1,2,3,4,5\nend\nelse\nW/prime=W\nend\nreturn W/prime\nis Ô¨Åt to be played at anytime.

It is developed in .NET Framework 4.0 using\nWindows Media Player Component 1.0. In addition to the\nfunctions of Windows Media Player, NextOne Player offers\n1Available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nextoneplayer/\n10612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 3 . The appearance of NextOne Player\nrecommendation function using the approach described in\nSection 3 and also collects data for performance evaluation.\nThe recommendation will work when the current song in the\nplaylist ends or NextOne button is clicked. The appearance\nof the application is shown as Figure 3. The Like it and\nDislike it buttons are used to collect user feedback.\nThe proportion of a song played is recorded and viewed as\nthe measure of satisfaction of a user for the song.\nIn order to compare our method with random selection,\nthe player selects one of the two methods when it is loaded.\nThe probability of running each method is set to 0.5. Every-\nthing is exactly the same except the recommendation me-\nthod. In a contrasting experiment, users cannot realize which\nmethod is selected.\nWe have collected data from 11 volunteers. They con-\nsist of 9 graduate students and 2 professors and include 3\nfemale students. They use the application in their devices\nwhich recommend songs from their own collections so the\nexperiment is run on open datasets.\n4.2 Results\nFirst, we show the running time of recommendation func-\ntion as it is known to have a major inÔ¨Çuence on the user\nexperience. The running time results appear to be in an ac-\nceptable range. We run the recommendation system for dif-\nferent magnitudes of the song library and at each size the\nsystem recommends 32 times2. Figure 4 shows the varia-\ntion in running time with the corresponding variations to the\nsize of song library. We observe that the running time in-\ncreases linearly with the increase in size of the song library.\nIn order to provide a user-friendly experience, the recom-\nmendation results are processed near the end of the current\nsong that is playing, and the result is generated when the\nnext song begins.\n2CPU: Intel i7, RAM: 4GB, OS: Windows 7\nFigure 4 . Running time of recommendation function\nFigure 5 . Representing the user logs to express favordness\nover a month\nIn order to evaluate the approach, the system records the\nplaying behavior of the user. We collected the user logs from\nvolunteers and calculated the average proportion of playing\nsong length, which means how much partition of a song is\nplayed before it is skipped. Under the assumption that the\npartition implies the ‚Äúfavoredness‚Äù of the song for a user, we\nevaluate the recommendation approach by the partition as\nshown in Figure 5, where the histograms represent the num-\nber of songs that were played on a day. The curves in the\ngraph represent the variation of the ‚Äúplaying proportion‚Äù.\nMoreover, continuous skips have a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence\non the user experience, hence they can play an important\nrole in evaluating the approach. A skip is deÔ¨Åned as chang-\ning to the next track by the user before playing 5% of the\nlength of the current track. The number of continuous skips\ncan be used as a measure of user dissatisfaction. Figure 6\nshows the distribution of continuous skips using our method\nand random selection.\nFrom Figure 5 and 6, we can conclude that the recom-\nmendation approach surpasses the baseline and our recom-\nmendation is effective. Our approach is able to Ô¨Åt to a user‚Äôs\ntaste, and adjust the recommendation strategy quickly when-\never user skips a song.\n107Poster Session 1\nFigure 6 .

The approach\nconsidered genre, recording year, freshness, favor and time\npattern as factors to recommend songs. The evaluation re-\nsults demonstrate that the approach is effective.\nIn further research, we can apply this technique to a mu-\nsic database in a server. Also other users‚Äô behavior can be\napplied to recommend songs for a user. We can mix recom-\nmendation of music in a local device and an online server\ndata to overcome the issue of cold start and hence obtain\nnew favorite songs.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] R. Ragno, C.

INTRODUCTION \nMusic is a product of human‚Äôs creativity, and yet f ew stu- \ndies have been done to analyze musical creativity u sing \ncomputational methods [2]. In the meantime, progres s has \nbeen made in the area of literature and language cr eativity \n(i.e., linguistic creativity). In this study, we bo rrow the \nmeasures of linguistic creativity to examine lyrics , the tex- \ntual part inherently integrated in many music piece s, aiming \nto provide an alternative approach to music creativ ity re- \nsearch that is complementary to modeling music comp osi- \ntion and music audio. This study is expected to pro vide new \ninsights to the relationship between mood and creat ivity in general in that the argument on whether positive or  nega- \ntive mood trigger higher creativity remains inconcl usive in \npsychology research [4].  \nIn Western English dictionaries, creativity is defi ned as \n‚Äú‚Ä¶the ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules , patterns, \nrelationships, or the like, and to create meaningfu l new \nideas, forms, methods, interpretations‚Äù [18]. Based  on this \ndefinition, when measuring creativity, a central ta sk is to \nidentify new or unusual patterns. In this study, we  apply \nthree linguistic measures to gauging lyrics creativ ity signi- \nfied by vocabulary richness and unusual word associ ations. \nThis research is expected to contribute to research  on \ncreativity in music, psychology and linguistics. Be sides, \nmood has been identified as a new metadata type or facet of \nmusic in recent years. Findings in this study will help ana- \nlyzing music mood from a new angle, lyrics creativi ty.  \n2.  RELATED WORK \nTo date creativity in lyrics has rarely been studie d. Howev- \ner, research in the following related areas has ins pired and \ninformed this research.  \n2.1  Lyrics and Music Mood Classification \nLyrics have been used in predicting music mood, eit her \nstandalone (e.g., [6] [8]) or being combined with m usic au- \ndio (e.g., [9], [10], [20]). These studies identifi ed lyric fea- \ntures that were effective in mood classification su ch as \nhigher-order bag-of-words features (e.g., trigrams and bi- \ngrams) [6], psycholinguistic and stylistic features  [8] [9]. \nIn terms of the relationship between lyrics and mus ic mood, \nHu and Downie [10] found lyrics were less effective  for \nclassifying negative and passive categories, while Schuller \net al. [20] revealed lyrics were more helpful on th e classifi- \ncation of valence (positive and negative feelings).  These \nstudies are insightful but none of them examined th e aspect \nof creativity. Although mood classification is not the focus \nof this study, findings on the relationship between  mood \nand lyrics creativity suggest adding lyrics creativ ity fea- \ntures may help improve mood prediction accuracy.  \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or  part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee pr ovided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial ad vantage and that cop- \nies bear this notice and the full citation on the f irst page.  \n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n789Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\n  \n \n2.2  Linguistic Creativity  \nIn the text domain, creativity is a new topic compa red to \nother aspects of text analytics such as sentiment a nalysis \nand topic detection. There have been several worksh ops on \nlinguistic creativity which focused on ‚Äúunusual‚Äù la nguage \nphenomena, such as metaphor and plot. As one of the  few \nstudies on metrics and tools for measuring linguist ic crea- \ntivity, [21] proposed a set of creativity measures which in- \nspired this study. The measures will be described i n details \nin Section 4.  \n2.3  Mood and Creativity  \nMood and creativity, as two inherent traits of huma n nature, \nhave long been studied in psychology, sociology and  cul- \ntural studies (e.g., [1]), however, research on the  relation- \nship between mood and creativity has been inconclus ive. \nSome studies support that positive mood increases c ogni- \ntive flexibility and thus enhances creativity [12].  For ex- \nample, Isen et al. [13] found that human subjects g ave \nmore unusual word associations under positive-affec t con- \nditions, which suggested positive relationship betw een pos- \nitive mood and creativity. At the same time, other studies \nsupport that negative moods may promote artistic cr eativi- \nty and that positive moods restrain it [4][15]. Con sequently, \na context-dependent view is increasingly accepted r ecently \n[5].  \n3.  HYPOTHESES \nIn this research we focus on the relationship betwe en mood \nand linguistic creativity in lyrics. We test three hypotheses \nto investigate the relationship between mood and cr eativity. \nThe mood categories studied in this paper are liste d in Sec- \ntion 5.1, Table 1. \nHypothesis 1 (H1): Lyrics in sad mood category are \nmore creative than those in happy mood categories. \nHypothesis 2 (H2): Lyrics in negative mood category  are \nmore creative than those in sad mood categories. \nHypothesis 3 (H3): Lyrics in active mood category a re \nmore creative than those in passive mood categories .  \nH3  is based on the connection between creativity and ac- \ntive brain activities. High creativity is more like ly to be ob- \nserved in lyrics with intense emotion than in calm ones.  \n4.  LYRICS CREATIVITY MEASURES \nMeasuring creativity is difficult because the evalu ation \ncould be subjective to some extent. To obtain robus t result \nwe adopt multiple measures to gauge lyrics creativi ty. We \ncan draw strong conclusion if all measures led to c onsistent \nresults. The first measure that we adopt is Type-to -Token Ratio, which has long been used to measure vocabula ry \nrichness in creative writing [14]. However, we have  also \nbeen cautioned that Type-to-Token Ratio may not be relia- \nble for texts shorter than 350 words [7]. This is p articularly \nrelevant to this study because the average length o f lyrics is \nabout 200 words.  \nThe other measures used in this study are inspired by the \nwork of Zhu and colleagues [21]. As one of the few papers \napplying computational measures to predicting lingu istic \ncreativity, [21] proposed 13 linguistic measures an d built a \nlinear regression model to detect measures with mor e pre- \ndiction power. Two of the most salient measures in [21] are \nadopted in this study to measure lyrics creativity.  Both of \nthem are psycho-linguistic measures.  \n4.1  Type-to-Token Ratio \nType-to-Token Ratio is defined as the number of uni que \nterms in a piece of text divided by the number of t otal terms. \nIt is often used to measure the vocabulary richness  of text. \nSpecifically, this measure (denoted as r thereafter) is de- \nfined as:  \nnxCruniq / ) ( =                                                   (1) \nwhere uniq C denotes number of unique words in a piece of \nlyrics and n is the total number of words in it. In calculating  \nthis measure, we removed function words (also calle d \nstopwords) in the lyrics because they do not carry indepen- \ndent meanings and thus do not add to vocabulary ric hness. \nAs vocabulary richness is related to creativity, a lyric with \nhigher value of r is regarded as more creative.  \n4.2  Word Norms Fraction \nThis measure is to capture how ‚Äúusual‚Äù a text is. I n cogni- \ntive psychology experiments, word norms , which represent \nassociations between words, were collected by askin g hu- \nman subjects to freely recall associative words (re sponses) \nwhen they see the cue words (stimuli). Therefore, l yrics \nwith high occurrences of word norms should indicate  high \n‚Äúusualness‚Äù and thus low creativity since creativit y often \ncorresponds to unusual patterns. \nSeveral existing word norms thesauri have been buil t by \ndifferent researchers in different countries. Becau se we are \ngoing to analyze U.S. rock lyrics, we choose a thes aurus \ndeveloped in U.S. to prevent cultural impact on wor d asso- \nciations. Specifically, we use the Free Association  Norms \nbuilt by researchers in University of South Florida  [16]. \nThis word norms dataset contains 72,176 pairs of as so- \nciated words. \nUsing the Free Association Norms, word norms fracti on \n(denoted as f thereafter) is calculated as:  \nny xCfnorm / ) , ( =                                             (2) \n79012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nWhere ) , (y xCnorm is the count of word pairs that appear \nin the Free Association Norms, and n represents number of \nwords in the text. \nAs lyrics are written in lines and, like a sentence , a lyric \nline can be regarded as a relatively independent un it, we \ncalculate the f measure for each lyric line and use the aver- \nage across all lines as a song‚Äôs creativity score. A song with \nlower  value of  f measure is regarded as more creative than a \nsong with higher value of f measure. \n4.3  WordNet Similarity \nWordNet [3] is an English lexicon with marked lingu istic \nrelationships among word senses including hyponyms,  \nhypernyms, holonym, entailment, etc. With hyponyms and \nhypernyms, WordNet can be seen as a hierarchy of wo rd \nconcepts and from which similarities between concep ts can \nbe calculated. There are quite a few similarity mea sures de- \nfined to leverage WordNet. Following [21], we also used \npath similarity  in this study but we adopted a different \nsoftware implementation, namely the Word::Similarit y \nmodule in CPAN [17]. Path similarity between two co n- \ncepts is calculated by counting the nodes between t hem in \nthe WordNet concept hierarchy. The similarity score  be- \nlongs to the interval of (0, 1]. If two word senses  are in the \nsame synset , meaning the two are synonyms in WordNet, \nthe similarity score would be 1. The more nodes on the path \nconnecting two word senses, the smaller the similar ity \nwould be. If two word senses do not have a path in between, \nthen the similarity score is -1. \nJust as word norms fraction, we take one lyric line  as the \nunit to calculate the WordNet similarity (denoted a s s the- \nreafter). Stopwords are removed and all pairs of re maining \nwords in a lyric line are considered: \nny xSspath ‚àë=) , (                                 (3) \nwhere ) , (y xSpath denote one word pair in a lyric line and n \nrepresents number of words in the line. The score o f a piece \nof lyrics is the average of scores across all lines . \nOne noteworthy issue is that WordNet is organized b y \nword senses instead of words. Because of the doubts  sur- \nrounding the effectiveness of Word Sense Disambigua tion \n(WSD), we did not conduct WSD and instead adopted a  \nsimplified approach that uses the highest similarit y between \nall senses of two words. \nSince s measures the similarity among words, a lyric \nwith lower s value would be regarded as more creative than \none with higher  s value.  5.  EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS \nTo test our hypotheses, we conducted an experiment to cal- \nculate and compare the aforementioned measures on a  data- \nset of lyrics with mood labels. \n5.1  The Dataset \nThis study adopts the Mood Tag Dataset 1 (MTD) used in \nthe Audio Tag Classification task in the Music Info rmation \nRetrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) 2010. This da ta- \nset include 3,469 songs in 18 mood categories that cover \npositive, negative, active and passive moods. In th e MTD, \neach song is labeled one or more mood categories ac cord- \ning to the social tags applied to it [11]. It is no teworthy that \nmore than 90% of the songs in the MTD are in the ge nre of \nrock and more than 95% of them are U. S. songs. The refore, \nfindings of this study are limited to U. S. rock ly rics that are \nwritten in English.  \nFor the experiment, we constructed our dataset by c om- \nbining mood categories in the MTD into the categori es re- \nquired by the hypotheses. Combinations of categorie s are \nshown in Table 1.  \nLyrics in this study were downloaded from an online  lyr- \nic database, LyricWiki.com. One unique nature of ly rics is \nthat repetitions are very common (e.g., chorus is u sually \nrepeated multiple times). However, the creative mea sures \n(e.g., Type-to-Token Ratio, r) punish repetitions, which is \nlikely to be unfair in the case of lyrics. Unlike r epetitions in \nother genres of text, lyrics usually repeat a whole  line or \nparagraph. If a line is creative, then repeating it  is still, if \nnot more, creative. Therefore, to alleviate such bi as, repeti- \ntions of entire lines and paragraphs as well as not ations in \nthe lyrics were removed. \nIn order to avoid any bias caused by lyric length, we ex- \ncluded songs with lyrics that are too long (> 500 w ords) \nand too short (< 100 words). As the experiment resu lts sug- \ngested (see Section 6), the measures are indeed mor e or less \nsensitive to lyric length. We also balanced the dat asets by \nsetting the same number of songs in each comparable  cate- \ngories (e.g., positive vs. negative). In the cases where one \ncategory had more songs than the other as provided by the \nMTD, a random selection was conducted in the larger  cate- \ngory. Table 1 shows the combination of categories a nd lyr- \nics statistics. There are in total 2715 unique song s in this \nexperiment.  \n5.2  The Results \n5.2.1  Happy vs. Sad \nThe creativity measures on happy and sad songs are pre- \nsented in Table 2. A t-test was conducted to examine the \n                                                           \n1http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2010:Audio_Tag_C lassification \n791Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\n  \n \nsignificance of the differences.

Results of Hypothesis 3  \n6.  DISCUSSION  \nTo further understand the relationship between lyri c crea- \ntivity and mood categories, we manually examined th e 10 \nmost creative and 10 least creative songs for each measure \n(except for f where 306 songs had the smallest value, 0). \nThe category distributions of these songs are liste d in \nTables 5 to 7. A general trend across these tables is that the \nmost creative songs include more sad and negative s ongs \nwhile the least creative songs consist of mostly ha ppy and \npositive songs. This observation is consistent with  the re- \nsults of statistical tests on Hypotheses 1 and 2. T he trend \nregarding active and passive songs differs across m easures, \nand thus once again we cannot draw consistent concl usion \non hypothesis 3. \nBesides statistics, it is helpful to look at the ly rics them- \nselves. The most creative song as measured by Type- to-\nToken Ratio ( r) is Elton John‚Äôs ‚ÄúTiny Dancer‚Äù. Part of its \nlyrics is presented below. It is indeed more creati ve than \nmost songs, and it happens to be the only happy son g \namong the 10 most creative ones. This discrepancy w ith the \ngeneral trend is worth further study in the future.  \n... \nBallerina you must've seen her \nDancing in the sand \nAnd now she's in me always with me \nTiny dancer in my hand \n \nJesus freaks out in the street \nHanding tickets out for God \nTurning back she just laughs \nThe boulevard is not that bad \n... \n \nAs the second most creative song selected by WordNe t \nSimilarity ( s), ‚ÄúSomething in the Way‚Äù by Nirvana (Sad, \nNegative and Passive) contains the following lyrics : \nAnd the animals I trapped have all become my pets \nAnd I'm living off of grass and the drippings from \nmy ceiling \nIt's okay to eat fish 'cause they don't have any \nfeelings \nSomething in the way mmm \n... \n79212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nAs it can be seen, this piece of lyrics indeed has some \nunusual combination of words or concepts.    \n10 Most Creative \nSongs (0.931 ‚â§ r ‚â§ \n0.971)  Happy 1  Sad 5  \nPositive  2 Negative  4 \nActive 3  Passive 2  \n10 Least Creative \nSongs ( 0.105 ‚â§ r ‚â§ \n0.203)  Happy 9  Sad 1  \nPositive  9 Negative  1 \nActive 1  Passive 4  \nTable 5.

Most and least creative songs as measured by \nWordNet Similarity ( s) \n  The fact that the word norm fraction measure ( f) was 0 \nfor 306 songs is interesting. A close inspection of  the lyrics \nreveals these 306 songs have short lyric lines. Thi s helps \nattribute the low f value to the way the measure was calcu- \nlated. The word pairs were formed with each line of  lyrics, \nand when the lines were short, there were few word pairs \nwhich resulted in fewer pairs matching the norms.  \nAnother observation is that there are controversial  songs. \n‚ÄúGangster Tripping‚Äù by Fatboy Slim was listed as th e No.1 \nleast creative song by Type-to-Token Ratio ( r) but was the \nNo.1 most creative song selected by WordNet similar ity (s) \nand was among the most creative songs measured by w ord \nnorm fraction ( f). A close examination of the lyrics uncov- \ners the reason: there are many word repetitions and  thus its \nr value is very low. However, words in each line are  neither \nsimilar nor with usual associations. A typical snip pet of the \nlyrics is shown below:  \n... \nWe gotta kick that gangster shit \nC'mon we gotta kick that gangster shit C'mon we gotta get that \nget that get that get that get that get that get \nthat get that get that get that \n \nIt's what we're doin' when a \nWhat we're doin' when a \nWhat we're doin' when a fatboy's slippin' \n... \nSuch discrepancy on a single song discloses the lim ita- \ntions of the creativity measures. Type-to-Token Rat io just \ncaptures one kind of creativity, but it biases agai nst crea- \ntivity of repetitive patterns while repetition is a  common \nfeature of lyrics and does not necessarily indicate  less crea- \ntivity. Word norm fraction heavily relies on the gi ven asso- \nciation norms. Furthermore, it favors lyrics with s horter \nlines since there are fewer word pairs in shorter l ines, \nwhich possibly leads to lower scores (higher creati vity). On \nthe contrary, WordNet similarity favors longer lyri c lines as \nthose lines potentially contain more word pairs wit h simi- \nlarity value of -1 (no WordNet path between the wor ds) \nwhich contributed to a lower s value (higher creativity). In \naddition, WordNet similarity is limited by the hype rnym \nand hyponym hierarchy which is only available for n ouns \nand verbs. This analysis suggests that combination use of \nmultiple measures gives the most comprehensive esti mation \nof creativity as a multi-faceted linguistic phenome non. \n7.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this study we examined the relationship between mood \nand creativity in U.S. rock lyrics. We used three c omputa- \ntional measures, Type-to-Token Ratio, Word Norm Fra c- \ntion, and WordNet Similarity, to gauge lyrics creat ivity, \nand then compared the difference in creativity betw een lyr- \nics in various mood categories. Because the three m easures \ncapture different aspects of linguistic creativity,  our result \nsuggests combination use of multiple measures to ga uge \nlyric creativity.  \nWe have also found that sad and negative lyrics cor res- \npond to higher linguistic creativity based on all t hree meas- \nures. This result supports previous studies on psyc holin- \nguistics that people write more creatively when the  text \nconveys sad or negative sentiment, but contradict p revious \nresearch that positive mood triggers more unusual w ord as- \nsociations. One interpretation is that the impact o f mood on \nthe task of writing a piece of text with certain th eme (like \nlyrics) is different from that on recalling free as sociation \nbetween words. The former one involves more specifi c de- \nscription. Furthermore, the correlation between cre ative \nwriting and negative emotion is actually reflected in voca- \nbulary of human languages. Sentiment lexicons in di fferent \nlanguages share a common feature that negative word s out- \nnumber positive words. Schrauf and Sanchez [19] als o \nfound that people recall more negative words than p ositive \n793Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\n  \n \nwords. These phenomena suggest that humans are actu ally \nbetter equipped with richer word choices when it co mes to \ndescribe negative emotions. \nThis study focuses on lexical creativity. As future  work \nit is worth investigating other dimensions of lingu istic crea- \ntivity: syntactic, morphological, and semantic crea tivity. \n8.  REFERENCES \n[1]  J. R., Averill, K.

INTRODUCTION\nMost people recognize music as a sequence of notes re-\nferred to as melody. Melody extraction from polyphonic\naudio is developed for various applications such as content-\nbased music information retrieval (CB-MIR), audio plagia-\nrism search, automatic melody transcription, music analy-\nsis, and query by humming (QBH) [1, 2, 6]. Despite its im-\nportance in various applications, melody is not clearly de-\nÔ¨Åned [3,4,6]. However, many people consider melody as the\nmost dominant single pitch sequence of a polyphonic audio\nand the considered algorithm extracts melody following this\nconsideration.\nDiverse melody extraction or transcription techniques have\nbeen proposed in recent years. Goto introduced a predomi-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc‚Éù2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.nant F0 estimation (PreFEst) algorithm [3]. It estimates the\nweights of prior tone-models over all possible fundamental\nfrequencies(F0s) based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\ncriterion and determines the F0‚Äôs temporal continuity by us-\ning a multiple-agent architecture. Paiva estimated possible\nF0s in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude\ndomain and decides a single pitch sequence (melody line)\nbased on various properties of melody pitches between near\nframes [5]. Poliner and Ellis approached the melody line es-\ntimation problem as a classiÔ¨Åcation problem and use a sup-\nport vector machine (SVM) classiÔ¨Åer in the estimation [7].\nRyyn ¬®anen deÔ¨Åned an acoustic model based on the hidden-\nMarkov model (HMM) to estimate melody, bass line and\nchords [1]. Durrieu extracted melody of singing voice by\nseparating singer‚Äôs voice and background music [2].\nThere are two main obstacles in extracting accurate melody\nline [9]. The obstacles are listed below:\n1)Accompaniment interference: Accompaniment sound\nsuch as harmonics of subdominant melodies and per-\ncussive sound acts as noise in the melody pitch esti-\nmation.\n2)Octave mismatch: Inaccurate melody pitch values which\nare one octave higher or lower than the ground-truth\nare often inaccurately estimated: the true melody pitch\nharmonics appear at either all estimated pitch harmonic\nlocations or every other pitch harmonic locations.\nIn this paper, an effective melody extraction algorithm\nthat considers the above obstacles is proposed. The algo-\nrithm deÔ¨Ånes a harmonic structure as a model for melody.\nRelated models have been studied for other related applica-\ntions. Heittola modeled the signal as a sum of spectral bases\nfor sound separation [10]. Duan used pre-coded spectral\npeak/non-peak position of each possible pitches for pitch\ntracking [11]. Bay used pre-coded harmonic structure shape\nfor source separation [12]. Goto modeled a pitch harmonics\nas a Gaussian mixture model [3].\nThe proposed algorithm minimizes the mean-square er-\nror between the given polyphonic audio and the harmonic\ncoded structure (HCS) that is constructed from a codebook\n227Poster Session 2\n'UVKOCVGF\u0003\nOGNQF[\u0003NKPGN-best  Melody\nCandidates Selection\nRule-based\nL-best Melody \nPitch Sequence EstimationMelody Pitch Sequence\nDecision2QN[RJQPKE\u0003\nCWFKQStep 1.

Finally, Section 4 concludes this paper.\n2. MELODY EXTRACTION ALGORITHM\nThe overall structure of the proposed algorithm is shown\nin Figure 1. The proposed algorithm extracts melody pitch\nsequence (melody line) in two steps: i) pitch-candidate esti-\nmation and ii) pitch-sequence identiÔ¨Åcation. In the estima-\ntion step, Nmelody pitch candidates are extracted by Ô¨Ånd-\ningNmost dominant HCS by minimizing minimum-mean-\nsquared error between the magnitude of STFT of framed\npolyphonic audio using the window function w[n]and a\nweighted HCS. In the identiÔ¨Åcation step, the melody pitch\nsequence is estimated based on a certain set of rules of melody\nline, after which a simple smoothing process is applied. Melody\nline is decided by Ô¨Årst selecting L-best melody line from a\nsequence of Npitch candidates and then determining the\nmost appropriate melody line from the selection. The smooth-\ning process is performed to remove spurious pitch sequences\nand octave errors.2.1 Melody Pitch Candidate Estimation\n2.1.1 Construction of HCS\nIn this paper, a harmonic coded structure (HCS) is proposed\nto Ô¨Ånd the dominant melody pitch harmonics in the STFT\ndomain. The windowed harmonic structure can be expressed\nas follows:\nhŒ∑[n]=w[n]H‚àë\nm=1bmcos(m¬∑2œÄŒ∑¬∑n+œïm), H=‚åäfs\n2Œ∑‚åã,(1)\nwhere fs, Œ∑, w [n], bm, and œïmare sampling frequency, the\nfundamental frequency (F0) of the HCS, analysis window,\namplitude of the mth harmonic, and the phase of the mth\nharmonic, respectively. The discrete-time Fourier transform\n(DTFT) of hŒ∑[n],HŒ∑(œâ), can be expressed as follows:\nHŒ∑(œâ)=H‚àë\nm=1BmW(œâ‚àímŒ∑), B m=bme‚àíjœïm,(2)\nwhere W(œâ)is the DTFT of w[n].\nThe number of harmonics within a certain bandwidth de-\npends on the pitch and the sampling frequency as deÔ¨Åned in\n(1), but we observe that the harmonic amplitudes tend to de-\ncrease with increasing harmonic index ( |Bm|<|Bm‚àí1|for\nm= 2,¬∑¬∑¬∑, H). For this reason, we use only 11 harmonics.\nThe overall envelop of the harmonic amplitudes varies\nwith instrument and pitch [13]. Therefore, it is difÔ¨Åcult to\nconstruct one Ô¨Åxed melody harmonic structure that Ô¨Åts all\nthe different harmonic amplitude patterns.\nTo construct a HCS to represent all the different har-\nmonic amplitudes of melody, a codebook is constructed from\nreal audio sample data. Harmonic amplitudes from 26,930\nframes of piano sound, 74,631 frames of saxophone sound\n[14], and 449,430 frames of singing voice [15] are used\n22812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(a)\n (b)\n(c)\nFigure 2 . Three estimated harmonic structures when k= 3\nand the F0 =400Hz: (a) The Ô¨Årst harmonic structure ( i=\n1), (b) the second harmonic structure ( i= 2), and (c) the\nthird harmonic structure ( i= 3).\nto build the codebook: these three sounds are present as\nmelody in all music considered.\nThe harmonic amplitude samples are clustered using the\nextended k‚àímeans clustering algorithm [16] and the cen-\ntroids of each cluster are used as codewords. Finally, the\nHCSs for every possible F0 are constructed using (1) and\n(2) based on the codebook. Figure 2 illustrates HCSs when\nk= 3and the F0 =400Hz.\n2.1.2 N-Best Melody Pitch Candidates Estimation\nThe proposed algorithm extracts Nmelody pitch candidates\nfrom each frame of a given polyphonic audio to reduce pitch\nestimation errors due to accompaniment interference and\noctave mismatch.\nThe pitch candidates are estimated based on the consen-\nsus that melody is considered as the single dominant pitch\nsequence in a polyphonic audio.

(5)\nThe HCS represents only the form of the harmonics, not\nthe exact magnitude of harmonics so scaling is required where\nthe weight Ci(Œ∑, l)is chosen to minimize the cost given in\n(3), thus\nÀÜCi(Œ∑, l) = argmin\nCi(Œ∑,l)Ji(Œ∑, l). (6)\nTo Ô¨Ånd ÀÜCi(Œ∑, l),Ji(Œ∑, l)is differentiated with respect to\nCi(Œ∑, l)and set equal to zero.

(9)\nFigure 3 shows the cost of each HCS of the lth frame when\nk= 3, and the costs of the circled peaks indicate J(min)\ni (l).\nNow, the index of the HCS of the lth frame I(l)is esti-\nmated by\nI(l) = argmin\niJ(min)\ni (l). (10)\nGenerally, harmonic amplitudes of consecutive frames are\nhighly correlated [9]. Thus, the index of HCS that appears\nfrequently within a neighborhood of few frames (including\nthe target frame) should be determined as a more consistent\nindex of the current frame. The updated index of the lth\nframe is expressed as follows:\nÀÜI(l) = mode[ I(l‚àíM), I(l‚àíM+ 1),\n¬∑¬∑¬∑, I(l+M‚àí1), I(l+M)].

To obtain a set of Npossible melody pitch\ncandidates of the lth frame, the following procedure is per-\nformed in obtaining the set Nlfor the lth frame.\nAlgorithm 1 N-best Pitch Candidates Determination\nNl={}\nforn= 1, ..., N do\n¬ØŒ∑= argminŒ∑Ã∏‚ààNlJÀÜI(l)(Œ∑, l)\nNl‚ÜêN l‚à™¬ØŒ∑\nend for\nFigure 4 (a) and (b) illustrate the STFT magnitude of a\nframe and its cost, respectively for N= 5. The circles in\n(b) indicate the estimated melody pitch candidates of the\nframe.\n2.2 Melody Pitch Sequence IdentiÔ¨Åcation\nOnce the N-best pitch candidates of each frame are obtained\nas described in the previous section, a single pitch sequence\n(melody line) that best represents the melody line is iden-\ntiÔ¨Åed. An estimate of the melody line can be obtained by\nselecting the pitch candidate leading to the minimum cost\nfor each frame. This, however, often leads to inaccurate\nestimation due to accompaniment interference and octave\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 4 . The STFT magnitude and the cost of the lth\nframe: (a)|S(œâ, l)|, (b) the cost of the lth frame obtained\nby an appropriate HCS.\nmismatch. Inaccuracy can be reduced by considering the\nforward and backward relationship among pitch candidates.\nThe proposed identiÔ¨Åcation algorithm estimates the melody\nline based on a rule-based method described below.\nA more robust melody pitch sequence is obtained by the\nfollowing two steps: i) L-best melody pitch sequences are\ndetermined and ii) melody is determined as the melody pitch\nsequence with the minimum sum cost. (see Figure 1).\n2.2.1 L-Best Melody Pitch Sequence Determination\nThe proposed melody line identiÔ¨Åcation algorithm estimates\nL-best melody lines from N-best pitch candidates of each\nframe based on the following properties of melody line.\nP1Thevibrato exhibits an extent of ¬±60‚àº200cent for\nsinging voice and only ¬±20‚àº30cent for music in-\nstruments such as saxophone, violin, and guitar [17].\nP2The note transitions within a musical structure are\ntypically limited to an octave [8].\nP3In general, a rest during singing is longer than 50 ms.\nBased on the above properties, the following rules are\ndeÔ¨Åned to estimate the melody line.\nR1Any two pitch candidates of successive frames are\nconsidered to be included in same melody line seg-\nment when the difference between the pitch values is\nless than the threshold described in P1.\nR2When two non-consecutive frames with a time gap\nless than 50ms have pitch candidates satisfying P1,\nthen interpolate between the two pitch values (by P3).\nR3When any two pitch candidates of successive frames\nsatisfy only P2and not P1andP3, a transition is as-\nsumed to have occurred in the melody line.\nIn the proposed algorithm, the threshold discussed in R1\nis set to 100 centwhich was determined experimentally from\nthe validation data. When one of the L-melody lines does\nnot satisfy the given rules, all melody lines are disconnected\nand a new set of L-melody lines are started.\n23012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 5 . Melody pitch sequence estimation: (a) three-best\nmelody pitch sequence estimation, (b) best melody pitch se-\nquence decision.\n2.2.2 Melody Pitch Sequence Decision\nA single melody pitch sequence must be selected from the\nL-best lines. The best melody pitch sequence is estimated\nbased on the melody deÔ¨Ånition: melody is a dominant pitch\nsequence in a polyphonic audio. Hence, after adding up\nthe costs in each melody line segment, the pitch sequence\nthat has the minimum summed-cost is selected as the best\nmelody line segment. Figure 5 (a) and (b) show the result of\nL-best melody pitch sequence estimation and melody pitch\nsequence decision, respectively. The vertical dotted lines in\n(a) represent the disconnecting positions, and the pitch se-\nquences between two vertical dotted lines are considered as\nmelody line candidates.\n2.2.3 Smoothing Process\nAlthough the procedures described in Section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2\neffectively reduce accompaniment interference and octave\nmismatch, it is difÔ¨Åcult to estimate the true melody pitch\nsequence if the interference occurs throughout the melody\nline. Thus, a smoothing process is applied to Ô¨Ånd a more\nrobust melody line.\nAfter the single melody pitch sequence is estimated, spu-\nrious sequences are removed and replaced with interpolated\npitch values between non-spurious pitches. The spurious\nsequence is determined by following conditions. i) A pitch\nsequence which switches to another note and returns to the\noriginal note within short time is considered as the spurious\nsequence. ii) A pitch sequence which has a transition over\none octave is also regarded as an inaccurate estimate.\n3. EVALUATION\nTwo CD-quality (16-bit quantization, 44.1 kHz sample rate)\ntest datasets are used for evaluation. One dataset used for\nthe evaluation is the Audio Description Contest (ADC) 2004\ndataset, and the other is the Music Information Retrieval\nEvaluation eXchange (MIREX) 2005 dataset.

In\nthe melody pitch candidate estimation step, 3-best pitch can-\ndidates are chosen for each frame ( N= 3) and the number\nof neighbor frames for deciding harmonic structure is set to\n7 (M= 7). In the melody pitch sequence identiÔ¨Åcaion step,\n3-best melody lines are estimated ( L= 3). These values are\ndetermined experimentally.\nThe estimated melody pitch is considered correct when\nthe absolute value of the difference between the ground-\ntruth and the estimated pitch frequency is less than quarter\ntone (50 cent). This is shown as\n|Fg(l)‚àíFe(l)| ‚â§1\n4tone (50cent ), (12)\nwhere Fg(l)andFe(l)denote ground-truth and estimated\npitch frequency of the lth frame, respectively.\nThe performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated\nwith row pitch accuracy (RPA) and row chroma accuracy\n(RCA) [8].\nTable 2 shows the evaluation results for all algorithms\nconsidered. The results on the ADC04 dataset are from the\nMIREX 2009 homepage [18]. When obtaining the results\non the MIREX05 dataset, we referred the results in [20] or\nused the codes publicly released by the authors [1, 21]. The\nbest result on each dataset is underlined, and the result of the\nproposed algorithm is highlighted in bold. The proposed\n231Poster Session 2\nalgorithm achieved the best performance both in RPA and\nRCA on the MIREX05 dataset. It also performed compara-\nbly to the other algorithms on the ADC04 dataset.\n4. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, an algorithm extracting melody from a poly-\nphonic audio using the HCS which is constructed from the\ncodebook of harmonic amplitude set obtained by k-means\nclustering is considered. The algorithm focuses on reducing\naccompaniment interference and octave mismatch. The al-\ngorithm consists of two steps: N-best pitch candidates esti-\nmation step and rule-based melody identiÔ¨Åcation step. First,\nmultiple pitch candidates of each frame are estimated us-\ning the cost function which determines the most dominant\nHCS of the frame in the MMSE sense. Second, a single\npitch sequence (melody line) is identiÔ¨Åed based on certain\nrules of melody line. To handle the spurious pitch sequence\nproblem, the smoothing process is applied. The considered\nalgorithm is tested on two datasets: the ADC04 dataset and\nthe MIREX05 dataset. Experimental results show that the\nproposed algorithm is better than or comparable to the other\nmelody extraction algorithms.\n5. REFERENCES\n[1]M. P. Ryyn ¬®anen and A. P.

INTRODUCTION \nThe comparative study of different folk music cultu res goes \nback to the early 20th century [1-2]. Although ethn omusi- \ncologists seemed to gradually forget the conception  of the \nclassical structural analysis and classification, t he develop- \nment of the computation tools led to a renaissance of the \nidea in recent years [3-4].  At the same time, the number of \nrepresentative national/regional digital folksong d atabases \nis also increasing rapidly. Therefore, a computer a ided \ncomparison of different musical cultures in order t o reveal \nhidden contacts of different musical cultures becam e very \ntopical. \nCurrent interdisciplinary research, based on the co operation \nof musicology, artificial intelligence research and  data min- \ning, focuses on automatic similarity measurement, s egmen- \ntation, contour analysis and classification using d ifferent \nstatistical characteristics, e.g. pitch-interval or  rhythm dis- \ntribution. A very widely used kind of artificial ne ural net- \nworks, the self organising map (SOM) proved to be a  very \nversatile tool of computing musicology [5]. SOM-bas ed \nsystems have been elaborated for simultaneous analy sis of \nthe contour as well as the pitch, interval and dura tion distri- \nbutions, based on the symbolic representation of th e music \n[6]. A cross-cultural study of different musical cu ltures was \nalso based on SOM technique [7].  \nThe operation of a SOM can be summarised for our ca se as \nfollows: Our input data to be classified are contou r vectors, containing subsequent pitch values of melodies of a  folk- \nsong database. The main goal of self organising map ping is \nto characterise the multidimensional point system c on- \nstructed by the set of these melody contour vectors  by a sig- \nnificantly smaller set of ‚Äúcontour type vectors‚Äù de scribing \nthe average contours in the local condensations of the input \ncontour vectors. Although the details of the calcul ations are \ndifferent, this goal essentially corresponds to tha t of the so-\ncalled K-means algorithm [8].  However, the SOM pro - \nduces something more: it assigns the resulting cont our type \nvectors to the lattice points of a grid topographic ally.  The \ntopographic structure of the resulting map is provi ded by a \ncooperative learning, modifying the contour type ve ctors \nlocated in neighbouring lattice points in parallel.  As a result \nof this local cooperation, similar contour type vec tors are \nlocated in neighbouring lattice points after learni ng.  \nDue to the topographic lattice, the SOM allows us t o de- \nscribe the inherent relations of a melody collectio n in two \nlevels. Similar melodies are classified as variants  of a com- \nmon contour type in the first level, while the rela tions of the \nclasses represented by the contour types themselves  are \nmapped into the topographic lattice in the second o ne.   \nThe overall relations in a data set can be excellen tly repre- \nsented on a SOM, providing that these relations can  be well \napproximated by a two-dimensional structure. Howeve r, \nstretching a more complicated structure into a plai n lattice \nresults in a significant loss of the accuracy of th e classifica- \ntion on one hand, and a non-perspicuous map on the other \nhand. In principle, it is possible to extend the ma p dimen- \nsion, but the resulting exponential increase in the  number of \nlattice points dramatically increases the computing  time and \nthe memory demand.  Therefore, we need some other t ech- \nnique to increase the degree of freedom of the poin ts in the \nmap.  \nTherefore, we elaborated a system combining the SOM  \ntechnique with a special version of the multidimens ional \nscaling (MDS) algorithm [9]. In MDS technique, the input \ndata to be visualised are presented in a quadratic matrix \ncontaining some distance-like or similarity-like va lues be- \ntween some objects. (For instance, the matrix can c ontain \ngeographical distances between towns, or dissimilar ity rat- \nings of melodies, etc.) The aim of the algorithm is  to repre- \nsent the objects (towns or melodies) in a low dimen sional \n299Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\n  \n \nspace (often in a plane) with the requirement that the dis- \ntances of the low dimensional points must optimally  corre- \nspond to the input values.  \nIn the present work, firstly we describe a method c on- \nstructed by two independent stages corresponding to  the \nabove-mentioned two-level characterisation of melod y cor- \npora. The first stage is a simplified, non-cooperat ive ‚Äì and \ntherefore non-topographic - version of SOM learning . In the \nsecond stage, the topographic low-dimensional mappi ng of \nthe resulting contour type vectors is accomplished by a \nvariant of the MDS algorithm. This allows us to pro ject the \nspatial regularities of the multidimensional input vector sys- \ntem to a continuous low-dimensional space without t he re- \nstrictions of the planar grid structure of the SOM.  In order \nto express the contact to the original SOM principl e and to \nemphasize the increased degree of freedom of the lo w di- \nmensional mapping, we call this technique ‚Äúself org anising \ncloud‚Äù (SOC).  \nAs a generalisation of the original SOM principle, we also \npresent the cooperative version of the above learni ng sys- \ntem, where the topographic arrangement is improved by a \nfeedback between the multidimensional learning and the \nlow dimensional mapping functions.  \nWe describe the results of a cross-cultural study o f 31 rep- \nresentative Eurasian and North-American folksong co llec- \ntions, based on the modelling by ‚Äúself organising c loud‚Äù \ntechnique. The studied cultures are as follows: Chi nese, \nMongolian, Kyrgyz, Mari-Chuvash-Tatar-Votiac (Volga  \nRegion), Sicilian, Bulgarian, Azeri, Anatolian, Kar achay, \nHungarian, Slovak, Moravian, Romanian, Cassubian \n(North-Poland), Warmian (East-Poland), Great-Polish  \n(Southern-Central Poland), Finnish, Norwegian, Germ an, \nLuxembourgish, French, Dutch, Irish-Scottish-Englis h \n(mainly Appalachian), Spanish, Dakota, Komi, Chanty , \nSerbian-Croatian (Balkan), Kurd, Russian (Pskov). O ur da- \ntabase contains digital notations of nearly 32000 f olk songs \narising from different written sources. All of thes e sources \napply the Western notation, thus, the microtonal ph enomena \nof the different cultures were eliminated by the au thors \nthemselves. The time duration and musical structure  of the \nmelodies is very variable, therefore we normalized the \nlength of the melody contours as follows.    \n \n2. THE MELODY CONTOUR VECTORS \n \nThe generation of vectors from melodies is summaris ed in \nFigure 1, showing the first section of a Hungarian folksong \nas an example. The continuous pitch-time function d erived \nfrom the score is represented by the thick line in Figure 1.  \n \nThere, the pitch is characterised by integer number s, in- \ncreasing 1 step by one semitone, with the zero leve l of the \npitch corresponding to the C tone. (In order to ass ure uni- \nform conditions, each melody was transposed to the final \ntone G.)  \n \nFigure 1.  The generation of the melody contour vectors x. \n \nOne can see in the figure that the duration of the temporal \nintervals of the pitch-time function is determined by the \nrhythmic value of the corresponding note. Thus, the  main \nrhythmic information is also encoded. For sampling,  the to- \ntal length of the pitch-time function was divided i nto D \nportions. Then, the ‚Äúmelody vector‚Äù    \n[ ]T\nk D kk k xxxx, , 2, 1,K = was constructed from the se- \nquence of the pitch-time samples of the kth melody (See \nFigure 1.).  \nSince D was uniform for the whole set, melodies could be \ncompared to each other using a distance function de fined in \nthe D-dimensional melody space, independently of their \nindividual length. Due to this normalisation, melod y con- \ntours can be compared independently of their measur e, \ntempo and syllabic structure. We studied the melody  vec- \ntors of the entire songs in the analysis, and we ha ve found \nthat a choice of 64 =D resulted in an appropriate accu- \nracy for each melody.  \n \n3. DETERMINATION OF THE CONTOUR TYPE \nVECTORS \n \nIn the first phase of the process, we determined N D=64 \ndimensional ‚Äúcontour type‚Äù vectors ic, characterising the \nmost important melody forms in a database containin g M \nmelodies. In a training step, the distances between  a ran- \ndomly selected melody contour kx and the contour type \nvectors are determined, and the contour type of min imal \ndistance ic is considered as the ‚Äúwinner‚Äù. The winner con- \ntour type is moved closer to the melody contour. \n \nIn the initial state, the vectors ic were filled by randomly \nselected melodies of the database.

This fact results in a remarkable simplifi cation of \nthe SOM algorithm and a significant improvement of the \nclassification as we will illustrate it below. Howe ver, these \nadvantages imply the disadvantage that the topograp hic ar- \nrangement of the contour types ‚Äì being a natural co nse- \nquence of the original SOM process - requires furth er com- \nputation. The algorithm producing a more comprehens ive \nand adequate spatial arrangement of the contour typ e vec- \ntors is a version of the multidimensional scaling t echnique, \nand is described below.     \n \n4. LOW DIMENSIONAL MAPPING OF THE \nCONTOUR TYPE VECTORS  \nThe basic idea of the multidimensional scaling algo rithm \ncan be formulated for our problem as follows: We ha ve a \nset of N pieces of  D=64  dimensional contour type vectors \nic, and we can calculate the N*N  dimensional quadratic, \nsymmetric matrix Q containing the squared Euclidean dis- \ntances j iq,of them. (The advantage of squaring will be ex- \nplained below.) We want to represent the N contour types \nby N vectors iv of a low dimensional point system, so that \nthe distances j id,between these points converge to the best \nlow-dimensional approximations of the  \n                      ‚àë\n=‚àí =D\nkk j k i j i cc q\n12\n, , , ) (                           (2) \nvalues in the sense of \n           min ) (\n1 12\n, ,, =‚àí =‚àë‚àë\n= =N\niN\njj i j ij iqdw S ,             (3)                                                                                   \n \nwhere S  is the stress function to be minimised, and \ni j j iww, ,= are weights expressing the importance of the \ndistance of the corresponding points in the stress function. \n(For instance, the exact distance of very dissimila r vectors may not be important in certain cases. Thus, the we ight val- \nues can be defined as functions of the input distan ces j iq,. ) \nThe minimum of the stress function is searched by a  gradi- \nent algorithm. For sake of simplicity, we consider the case \nwhen the low dimensional space is a plane, but the results \ncan be easily generalised to higher dimensions. At the be- \nginning, the N points are randomly located in the plane with \nthe coordinates ()2 ,1 ,,mmvv , where m denotes the serial \nnumber of the points. The gradient components of th e stress \nfunction in the 2 N dimensional space of the point co-\nordinates are the partial derivatives  \n \n        ( )\nk mj iN\niN\njj i j i j i\nk m vdqdwvS\n,,\n1 1, ,,\n,2‚àÇ‚àÇ‚àí =‚àÇ‚àÇ‚àë ‚àë\n= = ,      \n         2 , 1=k  Nm... 1=.

The algorith m can be \neasily generalised to 3 or more dimensional point s ystems.   \nComparing the above algorithm to the self organisin g map \n(SOM), an important difference lies in the fact tha t the low \ndimensional vectors iv are not fixed to lattice points, so \nthey are allowed to roam in the low dimensional spa ce, in \nsearch of their own optimal position. In order to e xpress this \nfree roaming of the point system during learning, a nd to dis- \ntinguish between the original SOM and the above des cribed \nalgorithm, we call it ‚Äúself organising cloud‚Äù (SOC) . \nThis non-cooperative form of the SOC algorithm acco m- \nplishes a two-level systematisation of melody colle ctions. In \nthe first step, the contour type vectors ic are determined, \nrepresenting the centres of local clusters of the m elody con- \ntour vectors in the D=64 dimensional melody space. Thus, \nthe first level of the systematisation is assigning  the melo- \ndies to the most similar contour type vectors. Havi ng ac- \ncomplished this classification process, the connect ions of \nthe melodies can be described, the higher-level con nections \nof the resulting melody classes, however, remain un re- \nvealed. These latter relations are described by map ping the \nD=64 dimensional contour type vectors to a low dime n- \nsional space. Thus, the second level of the systema tisation \nis the low dimensional representation and visualisa tion of \nthe relations between the melody classes having bee n de- \ntermined in the first level.  \n \n5.  COOPERATIVE LEARNING \n \nUp to this point, we have emphasized the advantages  of the \nindependence of the non-topographic learning- and t he to- \npographic visualising parts of the SOC technique. H owever, \nthe system can easily be modified to learn the cont our types \nin a cooperative way. In this case, all of the cont our type \nvectors located in the surroundings of the winner a re modi- \nfied by the current training vector, and their new low di- \nmensional coordinates are re-calculated simultaneou sly with \nthe contour type learning steps, using Equations (5 ), (6) and \n(7). Since the vectors iv can freely move in the low dimen- \nsional space during the process, this cooperative l earning \napproaches similar vectors to each other, resulting  in a more \narticulated system of the low dimensional clusters.  How- \never, an uncontrolled cooperative process can lead to an ac- \ncelerated approach of neighbouring vectors, resulti ng in a \ntotal collapse of the whole system into one point. This prin- \ncipal problem can be solved by the prohibition of t he coop- \nerative training within a critical radius around th e winner. \nAlthough this version produces a suboptimal contour  type \nestimation - similarly to the SOM algorithm -, it m ay sig- \nnificantly improve the visual representation of the  clusters.  \n \n \n 6. CROSS-CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF 31 MUSICAL \nCULTURES USING THE SOC ALGORITHM \n \nAs an application of the SOC algorithm, we summaris e the \nprocedure and the results of a cross-cultural study  of 31 folk \nmusic cultures in this chapter. The cultures were r epre- \nsented by 31 databases containing 1000 ‚Äì 2500 melod ies by \nculture. The first step of the analysis was the det ermination \nof the contour type collections of the 31 cultures,  using non-\ncooperative SOC mapping of the databases one by one . In \nthe second phase, we unified the resulting 31 conto ur type \ncollections into one training set, and trained a tw o-\ndimensional ‚Äúcommon‚Äù SOC having 1000 contour type v ec- \ntors. After training by the nearly 12000 contour ty pe vectors \narising from the 31 collections (400-500 vectors by  cul- \nture), the resulting 1000 common vectors represent the most \ncharacteristic melody contours appearing in the 31 cultures. \nFigure 2 shows the resulting common musical maps ge ner- \nated by non-cooperative, as well as cooperative tra ining of \nthe SOC. The figure verifies that the cooperative l earning \nyields a much more arranged ‚Äúmusical map‚Äù. The musi cal \nmeaning of the main areas of this map is demonstrat ed by \nthe contour type examples in Figure 3. \n \n \nFigure 2. Self organising clouds of the common contour \ntype collection using non-cooperative (a), and coop erative \n(b) learning. \n \nAt this point, we have to define the concept of ‚Äúac tivation‚Äù \nof the common contour type vectors as follows: a co ntour \ntype vector of the common SOC is ‚Äúactivated‚Äù by a t raining \nvector when the distance between them is less than a \nthreshold value (see Equation 2). For example, the black \npoints in Figure 2 correspond to the contour types activated \nby the Hungarian melody of Figure 4. The distributi on of \nthe points illustrates that the cooperative learnin g moves \nsimilar contour types into a more compact cluster. Extend- \ning this concept to national/areal sets of training  vectors, we \ncan say that the 31 contour type collections activa te differ- \nent subsets of the 1000 common vectors.  \n \nFigure 3 shows the common SOC with 6 different nati onal \nactivations and some contour type examples being ve ry \ncharacteristic in the given cultures. Since the arr angement \nof the SOC reflects purely musical conditions, it i s not a \ntrivial result that the different cultures are loca ted in more \nor less continuous areas. This fact refers to diffe rent musical \nstyles dominating in different cultures. Some of th ese very \ncharacteristic melody forms are also indicated in F igure 3.  \n30212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.  Activated area of the common contour type cloud \nby contour type collections of 6 different cultures . \n \nFor instance, contour example 1 shows that descendi ng \nmelodies with a high range are simultaneously domin ating \nin the Chinese, Hungarian and Turkish activation ar ea. An \nexample for such melodies with Hungarian, Chinese, Anato- \nlian and Dakota parallels is shown in Figure 4.  \n \n       Figure 4.  Melody examples of type 1 in Figure 3. \n \nContour example 2 and 5, representing melodies with  low \nrange demonstrate the musical background of the def inite \noverlap between Anatolian and Bulgarian cultures.  \nThe Hungarian area shows a significant overlap with  the \nChinese and Anatolian ones, but contour example 3 a lso \ndemonstrates a significant common musical style of domed \nmelody forms with the Irish-Scottish-English cultur e.  \nAt the same time, the Irish-Scottish-English corpus  has also \na significant overlap with the German one in the ar ea of as- \ncending forms moving beyond the final tone (see con tour \nexample 4).  The sizes of the overlaps benchmarked against the t otal \nsizes of the activated area refer to the intensity of the rela- \ntions of musical cultures [7]. We considered these relative \noverlap sizes as similarity ratings of musical cult ures, and \nrepresented the resulting system of musical languag e groups \nusing the MDS algorithm described above. The two-\ndimensional MDS plot of the connections is shown in  Fig- \nure 5. The edges indicate pairs of cultures with th e largest \noverlaps. We also indicated some sub-graphs where t he \nnodes mutually are in close musical contacts with e ach \nother. The graph shows a very clear structure with seven \nmusically well interpretable clusters. The right br anch of the \nsystem contains the mutually very closely related { Chinese \n‚Äì Volga ‚Äì Mongolian}, {Hungarian ‚Äì Slovak} and {Tur kish \n‚Äì Karachay ‚Äì Sicilian ‚Äì Dakota} groups. The left br anch is \nconstructed by the {Finnish ‚Äì Norwegian ‚Äì ISE} and \n{German ‚Äì Luxembourgian ‚Äì French ‚Äì Holland} cluster s, \nwhereas the {Bulgarian ‚Äì Balkan - Kurdish ‚Äì Azeri} and \n{Russian ‚Äì Komi - Warmian (East-Poland)} groups con - \nstruct clearly separate clusters.  \nThe close contacts of the above discussed seven ‚Äúmu sical \nlanguage groups‚Äù can be traced back to certain musi cal \nstyles being simultaneously present in more culture s. Com- \nparing Figure 5 to Figure 3, one can recognise that  the six \nactivator cultures of the common musical map can be  con- \nsidered as representatives of the above mentioned ‚Äú musical \nlanguage groups‚Äù. Therefore, contour examples 1-5 i n Fig- \nure 3 represent right the most characteristic commo n musi- \ncal forms contacting the musical language groups as  well.  \n \n \nFigure 5.

CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have described a technique which learns the grou p av- \nerages of the local condensations of multidimension al point \nsystems on the one hand and represents the similari ty condi- \n303Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\n  \n \ntions of the learned average vectors in a low dimen sional \npoint system on the other hand. Basically, the algo rithm can \noperate in two modes: In the non-cooperative mode o nly \none average vector is modified in one training step  and the \nstate of the other vectors is independent of this m odifica- \ntion. In the cooperative mode the training is exten ded to a \ngroup of average vectors, and a feedback comes into  exis- \ntence between the learning of the multidimensional aver- \nages and the low dimensional arrangement. \nThe non-cooperative learning of the contour type ve ctors \npermits the convergence to the exact centres of the  local \ncondensations of the training vectors, therefore th e SOC \ncorresponds to the K-means algorithm in this case. The co- \noperative learning realises a compromise between th e accu- \nracy of the multidimensional learning and the low d imen- \nsional representation, therefore the system converg es into a \nsub-optimal state in this case. However, the cooper ativeness \ncan be tuned by the learning radius parameters, and  the \nbenefit of a well accomplished cooperative training  may be \na more transparent low dimensional representation o f the \nmultidimensional clusters, whereas the accuracy of the \nlearning also remains acceptable.  \nThe low dimensional topographic representation of t he con- \ntour type vectors is accomplished by a weighted MDS  algo- \nrithm. This increases the degree of freedom of the mapping, \nbecause the locations of the low dimensional points  are not \nbounded to a lattice, and their dimensionality can be opti- \nmised without a significant increase in the computi ng time.  \n  We applied the method to an analysis of the conne ctions \nof 31 Eurasian and North-American folk music cultur es. We \nhave found that the changeover to the continuous lo w di- \nmensional space of the SOC from the plain lattice s tructure \nof the SOM yields a more articulated low dimensiona l data \nrepresentation and a musically well interpretable s ystemati- \nsation of the melody contours. \nUsing the SOC technique, we have determined a conju gate \nmusical map of the most important melody forms in t he \nstudied cultures, and have found that the different  cultures \noccupy well defined continuous areas of this map. T he \ntechnique allowed us to trace back this ‚Äúmusical ge ogra- \nphy‚Äù to the dominance of certain well distinguishab le musi- \ncal styles in different cultures. Exactly the close  correlation \nof different cultures with certain areas of the mus ical map \ncalls the attention to the overlaps, referring to s ignificant \ninteractions of the studied cultures. The analysis of these \noverlaps revealed a perspicuous system of cross-cul tural \nconnections, which was represented by an MDS plot o f the \nprobabilities of deterministic interactions. The co mmon \nmusical forms standing in the background of the mos t im- \nportant cultural connections were also identified f rom the \noverlap areas. We hope that these results demonstra te the \ntimeliness of an extensive study of musical languag e groups \nand call the attention to the importance of the ora l musical \ntradition of the humanity.

INTRODUCTION\nSchenkerian analysis [13] is a widely used and well-developed\napproach to music analysis. Analyses interpret composi-\ntions as a hierarchical structure of musical events, allow-\ning a user to view a tonal composition as a collection of\nrecursive musical elaborations of some fundamental struc-\nture. The method of analysis starts from the original com-\nposition and produces a sequence of intermediate analyses\nillustrating successive simpliÔ¨Åcations or reductions of the\nmusical structure of the piece, ultimately arriving at an irre-\nducible background structure. Each reduction is a claim that\na group of musical events (such as notes, intervals, or har-\nmonies)Xderives its function within the composition from\nthe presence of another group of events Y, and therefore\nthe overarching musical structure of the collection X‚à™Yis\ndetermined predominantly by the events in Y. In Schenke-\nrian terms, we often say the events in Xconstitute a pro-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.longation of the events in Y, in that the events in Yremain\n‚Äúin effect without being literally represented at every mo-\nment.‚Äù [2]\nSchenker‚Äôs ideas may be viewed as a set of tools for con-\nstructing a hierarchical analysis of a composition according\nto the analyst‚Äôs own musical intuition, or as theory of tonal-\nity such that every tonal composition, and only tonal compo-\nsitions, should be derivable from the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of Schenkerian\nanalysis [1, 15].\nOpinions differ about the underlying goals of Schenke-\nrian analysis. However, one thing is clear: Schenker‚Äôs ideas\nalone do not prescribe an unambiguous and complete algo-\nrithm for analysis. That said, generations of music theo-\nrists have used Schenker‚Äôs ideas to construct analyses. In\nthis paper, we pursue an empirical strategy for discovering\nthe underlying regularities of those analyses and producing\nnew analyses based on those regularities. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we\nderive statistical regularities from the largest known corpus\nof machine-readable Schenkerian analyses, and we identify\nan algorithm for deriving the maximum likelihood analysis,\ngiven these regularities. We demonstrate that the algorithm\ncan reproduce the likelihood ranking implied by a proba-\nbility distribution over possible analyses. Together, these\nÔ¨Åndings provide the foundation of an empirical strategy for\nunlocking the basic concepts underlying any method of hi-\nerarchical music analysis.\n2. REPRESENTATIONS AND ALGORITHMS FOR\nSCHENKERIAN ANALYSES\nTree-like data structures are natural representations for hier-\narchies. Combined with the Schenkerian idea of the analysis\nprocedure revealing multiple levels of musical structure in a\ncomposition, many researchers have used different types of\ntrees to represent an analysis and the structural levels within.\nA commonly used tree representation of an analysis uses\nleaf nodes to represent notes or chords of the original com-\nposition, and interior nodes to represent Schenkerian reduc-\ntions of each node‚Äôs children. This formulation has been\nused by Frankel, Rosenschein and Smoliar [3,4], Rahn [12],\nLerdahl and Jackendoff [8], Marsden [9, 10] and Kirlin [7].\nAlgorithms for analysis that use such representations have\nhad varying levels of success [6, 10, 11, 14].\n393Poster Session 3\nYust argues for using a hierarchy of melodic intervals‚Äî\nthe spaces between the notes‚Äîrather than the notes or chords\nthemselves. He contends that such a hierarchy of inter-\nvals better reÔ¨Çects Schenker‚Äôs original ideas and reduces\nthe size of the search space of analyses [15]. Mavromatis\nand Brown [11] and Gilbert and Conklin [5] also suggest\nan interval-based hierarchy would alleviate some represen-\ntational problems.\nConsider Figure 1(a), an arpeggiation of a G major triad\nwith passing tones between the notes of the chord. Rep-\nresenting this musical Ô¨Ågure as a hierarchy of notes forces\nus to choose a single parent note for each passing tone, ob-\nscuring the nature of a passing tone as a voice-leading con-\nnection from one note to another. Using a hierarchy among\nintervals between the notes, however, allows us to represent\nthe musical structure as the tree in Figure 1(b). If we then\nreplace the nodes of this tree with edges, we obtain the rep-\nresentation in Figure 1(c), a particular kind of graph called\namaximal outerplanar graph , or MOP, a representation for\nmusical analysis Ô¨Årst suggested by Yust [15]. MOPs are\nisomorphic to binary trees representing interval hierarchies\nsuch as that in Figure 1(b), though because the MOP does\nnot duplicate notes as the tree does, it is a more compact\nrepresentation of the hierarchy.\n/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/clefs.G/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(a)(b)(c)D‚ÄìGD‚ÄìBB‚ÄìGD‚ÄìCC‚ÄìBB‚ÄìAA‚ÄìGDGBCA\nFigure 1 .

(c) The MOP corresponding to the arpeggiation.\nEvery MOP deÔ¨Åned on a given sequence of notes is a\ntriangulation of the polygon formed by the edges between\nconsecutive notes and the edge from the Ô¨Årst note to the\nlast note. Each triangle in the MOP speciÔ¨Åes a prolongation\namong three notes; we will occasionally refer to a triangle\nas containing two parent notes and a single child note , or\na single parent interval and two child intervals . Either in-\nterpretation is musically correct: the left parent note is pro-\nlonged by the child note during the time span between the\nleft and right parent notes, or the melodic interval between\nthe left and right parent notes is prolonged by the motion to\nand away from the child note.\nBecause every prolongation requires two parent notes, in-\ncomplete prolongations, such as incomplete neighbor notes,\npresent a representational challenge in MOPs. Yust arguesthat in these situations, it is appropriate to have the nearest\nstructural note substitute for the missing parent note. To al-\nlow for incomplete prolongations at the beginning or ending\nof a piece, the MOP model places special ‚Äúinitiation‚Äù and\n‚Äútermination‚Äù events at the beginning and ending of the pas-\nsage being analyzed that may be used as parents for such\nprolongations.\nThe MOP model offers a new look at representation of\nanalyses that more closely parallels Schenkerian analysis in\npractice due to the MOP‚Äôs emphasis on preserving voice\nleading connections. Further discussion of MOPs may be\nfound in Yust‚Äôs dissertation [15].\n3. A GENERALIZATION OF MOP: OPC\nThe deÔ¨Ånition of a MOP stated above can only handle a sin-\ngle monophonic sequence of notes, though the model can\nbe extended to allow for a single structure to represent the\nanalysis of a contrapuntal or polyphonic composition [15].\nHowever, in the interest of simplicity, we have chosen to\nstore such analyses as collections of separate MOPs occur-\nring simultaneously in time. For instance, in a two-voice\ncomposition, there would be one MOP to represent the up-\nper voice, and one MOP to represent the lower voice. Tak-\ning both MOPs together as a collective representation of an\nanalysis gives us an OPC (outerplanar graph collection).\nThe OPC representation also relaxes one restriction on\nthe constituent MOPs, namely that the polygon formed by\nthe edges connecting the notes of the composition must be\ncompletely triangulated. This is allowed because many anal-\nyses done by humans contain prolongations with multiple\nchild notes. Such prolongations must necessarily be repre-\nsented by polygons larger than triangles; in general, a pro-\nlongation with nchildren will be represented in an OPC by\na polygon with n+ 2sides.\nWe devised a text-based Ô¨Åle format that can encode many\nof the annotations found in a Schenkerian analysis, includ-\ning any type of prolongation (such as passing tones, neigh-\nbor tones, and similar diminutions), voice exchanges, ver-\nticalizations of notes, repeated notes merged in an analy-\nsis, and instantiations of the Ursatz (the fundamental back-\nground structure posited by Schenker). The format is easy\nfor the human to input and easy for the computer to parse.\nWe also developed an algorithm to convert an analysis in\nthis encoding into an OPC.\n4. EXPLORATION OF ANALYSES AS MOPS\nWe collected a set of eight excerpts of music along with\nSchenkerian analyses of the excerpts. The excerpts and anal-\nyses were drawn from Forte and Gilbert‚Äôs Introduction to\nSchenkerian Analysis [2] and the accompanying instructor‚Äôs\nmanual, and were chosen for their similar characteristics:\nthey are all from compositions for a keyboard instrument in\n39412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\na major key, do not modulate within the excerpt, and have a\ncomplete instance of the Ursatz , possibly with an interrup-\ntion. The analyses were algorithmically translated to OPCs.\nThe data set contained 66 measures of music and 617 notes.\nOverall, 270 prolongations were translated into 356 poly-\ngons in the OPCs. Though small, this corpus represents\nthe largest known data set of machine-readable Schenkerian\nanalyses.1\nBecause we are interested in prolongational patterns and\neach triangle in a MOP speciÔ¨Åes the prolongation of an in-\nterval by two other intervals, we examined how often certain\ntypes of triangles occurred in the human-produced analyses\nrepresented as OPCs. We deÔ¨Åned a triangle by an ordered\ntriple of the size of the parent interval and the sizes of the\ntwo child intervals. Intervals were denoted by size only, not\nquality or direction (e.g., an ascending major third was con-\nsidered equivalent to a descending minor third), except in\nthe case of unisons, where we distinguished between per-\nfect and non-perfect unisons. Intervening octaves in inter-\nvals were removed (e.g., octaves were reduced to unisons),\nand furthermore, if any interval was larger than a fourth, it\nwas inverted in the triple. These transformations equate pro-\nlongations that are identical under octave displacement.\nBecause OPC analyses permit polygons larger than trian-\ngles, extra care was required to derive appropriate triangle\nfrequencies for these larger polygons. As any polygon can\nonly be triangulated in a Ô¨Åxed number of ways, and each\nof those triangulations contains the same number of trian-\ngles, for every polygon larger than a triangle we counted the\nfrequencies of every possible triangle over all possible tri-\nangulations of the polygon and weighted the resulting fre-\nquencies so that they would sum to the number of triangles\nexpected in a triangulation.\nWe tested the triangle frequencies to see if they were sta-\ntistically signiÔ¨Åcant given the null hypothesis that the Forte\nand Gilbert analyses resemble random analyses (where any\ntriangulation of a MOP is as likely as any other) in their\ntriangle frequencies. The expected frequencies under the\nnull hypothesis are not uniformly distributed, even if all the\nnotes in a composition are considered distinguishable from\neach other. Therefore, for each excerpt in our corpus, we\ngenerated 5,000 analyses of the excerpt uniformly at ran-\ndom. Each of these analyses was produced by taking the\ncorresponding human-created analysis as an OPC and re-\ntriangulating each MOP inside. We used these random anal-\nyses to compute the expected frequencies of every type of\ntriangle possible and compared them to the observed fre-\nquencies from the human-produced analyses. We ran indi-\nvidual binomial tests for each type of triangle to determine\nif the observed frequency differed signiÔ¨Åcantly from the ex-\npected frequency.\nFive types of triangles had differences between their ob-\n1Analyses are available at http://www.cs.umass.edu/ ‚àºpkirlin/schenker.served and expected frequencies that were statistically sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant at the 5% level; these are shown in Figure 2. A\ncanonical prolongation for each type of triangle is depicted\nat the far left of each row in the Ô¨Ågure, though because inter-\nvals have had intervening octaves removed and are inverted\nif larger than a fourth, each type of triangle represents an\nentire class of prolongations. Triangles that contained a per-\nfect unison as a child interval are not shown in this table,\nas we suspect their frequencies are biased due to the way\nmerged notes are encoded in an analysis. Consecutive notes\nof the same pitch are often implicitly merged in a Schenke-\nrian analysis, and these are encoded as prolongations of the\ninterval from the Ô¨Årst note with the repeated pitch to the note\nfollowing the last note with the repeated pitch.\nWe can musically interpret each of the Ô¨Åve types of tri-\nangles shown in Figure 2 and hypothesize the reasons for\nthe differences in frequency. The Ô¨Årst row in the Ô¨Ågure\n(p= 0.001) tells us that triangles describing an interval of\na third being elaborated by two seconds are more likely to\nappear in a human-produced analysis than in a randomly-\ngenerated analysis. A passing tone Ô¨Ålling in the interval\nof a third would fall into this category. We suspect such\npatterns are numerous due to the theorist‚Äôs preference for\nidentifying stepwise voice leading connections in an analy-\nsis. The second row ( p= 0.003) shows us the commonality\nof a melodic second being elaborated by a third and then a\nstep in the opposite direction, for instance, when the inter-\nval C‚ÄìD is elaborated as C‚ÄìE‚ÄìD. Again, this corresponds to\nthe frequent situation of a stepwise pattern being decorated\nby an intermediate leap. The third row ( p= 0.02) shows\nthe preponderance of melodic Ô¨Åfths (inverted fourths) be-\ning elaborated by consecutive thirds, corresponding to the\narpeggiation of a triad. Harmonies are frequently prolonged\nby arpeggiations of this type.\nThe fourth row in Figure 2 ( p= 0.03) shows that trian-\ngles corresponding to a melodic second elaborated by a step\nand then a leap of a third in the opposite direction occur less\nfrequently than expected. An example would be the interval\nC‚ÄìD being elaborated by the pattern C‚ÄìB‚ÄìD. Interestingly,\nthis is the reverse case of the second row in the table. We\nhypothesize that analysts tend not to locate this type of pro-\nlongation because the leap of a third could suggest a change\nof harmony, and therefore it is more likely that the Ô¨Årst note\nof the new harmony‚Äîthe B in the example‚Äîwould be the\nmore structural note and not the D as would be implied by\nsuch a prolongation. The last row ( p= 0.05) illustrates\nanother type of prolongation found less often than the ran-\ndom analyses would suggest: a melodic fourth being elabo-\nrated by a step and a leap in the same direction. Musically,\nthis type of prolongation could be located infrequently in an\nanalysis for the same reasons as the prolongation described\nin the fourth row.\nThese statistically signiÔ¨Åcant differences show that there\n395Poster Session 3\n/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s23rd2nd4th2nd3rd3rd2nd2nd3rd05030201040Parent intervalChild interval 1Child interval 2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s22nd4th2nd2nd3rd3rd/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2FrequencyExpectedObservedMore frequentthan expectedLess frequentthan expectedFigure 2 .

Whether those consistencies\nare due to the analysis method or the analyst‚Äôs own procliv-\nities is irrelevant, as the consistencies can be exploited to\nproduce an analysis algorithm in either case.\n5. PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATIONS OF MOPS\nWe now show how to harness the frequencies computed in\nthe previous section to produce an algorithm capable of hi-\nerarchical music analysis. Though we previously deÔ¨Åned a\ntriangle by the intervals between the notes of its vertices,\nin this section we will explore triangles deÔ¨Åned by the notes\nthemselves. DeÔ¨Åning a triangle in this fashion requires more\ndata than we currently have to obtain statistical signiÔ¨Åcance,\nbut we believe using this formulation will lead to better per-\nformance in the future.\nWith a set of triangle frequencies deÔ¨Åned by the end-\npoints of the triangles in a MOP, we may deÔ¨Åne a number of\ndifferent probability distributions using these frequencies. If\nwe call the left parent note L, the right parent note R, and\nthe child note C, we deÔ¨Åne the joint triangle distribution as\nP(L,R,C ). This distribution tells us the overall probability\nof seeing a certain type of triangle in any analysis. We also\ndeÔ¨Åne the conditional triangle distribution asP(C|L,R),\nwhich tells us the probability that the interval between the\nleft parent note and the right parent note will be elaborated\nby the child note C.\nUsing either of these two distributions, we can deÔ¨Åne the\nprobability of a Schenkerian analysis in the MOP model.\nGiven that a MOP is completely deÔ¨Åned by its constituent\ntriangles, we deÔ¨Åne the probability of a MOP analysis for\na given sequence of notes as the joint probability of all the\ntriangles that comprise the MOP. If a MOP analysis Afor\na given sequence of notes Ncontains triangles T1,...,T n,\nthen we state P(A|N) =P(T1,...,T n). However, train-\ning such a joint model directly would require orders of mag-\nnitude more data than we suspect could ever be collected.\nInstead, as an approximation, we will assume that the pres-\nence of a certain triangle in an analysis is independent ofthe presence of all the other triangles. Thus, P(A|N) =\nP(T1)¬∑¬∑¬∑P(Tn).\nThe question remains whether to use the joint or condi-\ntional triangle distributions to deÔ¨Åne P(Ti). The joint model\nbetter reÔ¨Çects overall frequencies of triangles, but the con-\nditional model easily provides a generative strawman algo-\nrithm for producing an analysis: to analyze a sequence of\nnotesn1,...,n k, Ô¨Ånd arg maxi‚àà{n2,...,n k‚àí1}P(C=i|\nL=n1,R=nk)to Ô¨Ånd an appropriate child note of n1\nandnk, then recursively perform the same operation on the\ntwo resulting child intervals.\nThe issue of triangle independence remains, regardless of\nthe speciÔ¨Åc triangle model chosen. An experiment justiÔ¨Åes\nour independence assumption. Our goal in the experiment\nis to use a random procedure to generate a multiset of anal-\nyses for a single piece of music, with the frequencies in the\nmultiset reÔ¨Çecting the real-world distribution of how ana-\nlysts would interpret a piece. The ranking of the analyses by\nfrequency in the multiset serves as ground-truth. Using this\ncorpus of generated analyses, we compute triangle frequen-\ncies from the corpus as described in Section 4 (though using\ntriangle endpoints instead of intervals between endpoints)\nand obtain a probability estimate for each analysis by using\nthe independence of triangles assumption. We compare the\nground-truth ranking with a new ranking obtained by sorting\nthe analyses by the newly-obtained probability estimates.\nThe exact procedure is as follows. We assumed that every\nnote in the piece was distinguishable from every other note,\nsomething not feasible for earlier experiments but done here\nwith the knowledge that humans may use a note‚Äôs location\nwithin the piece as a feature of the note to guide the analysis\nprocedure. Therefore, each piece was a sequence of inte-\ngersN= 1,2,...,n . We took a uniform sample of 1,000\nMOPs from the space of possible MOPs over N.2We ran-\ndomly chose one MOP to be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù analysis, and created\nan arrayAwith the 1,000 MOPs sorted in decreasing order\nof similarity to the best MOP, where similarity was deÔ¨Åned\nas the number of triangles in common between two MOPs.\n2The number of MOPs for a sequence of length nis the (n+ 2) th\nCatalan number [15], which is exponential in n, hence the sampling.\n39612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nThe best MOP was placed at A[0]. We used a variation of\nthe normal distribution to sample one million MOPs from A\nas follows: each sample was the MOP at position iin the\narray, where iwas the absolute value of a normal random\nvariable with ¬µ= 0 and varying œÉ, rounded down. Values\nofithat corresponded to MOPs outside of array Awere re-\nsampled. The one million sampled MOPs were placed into a\nmultisetMand sorted by decreasing frequency into an array\nR, representing the ground-truth ranking of MOPs.\nWe then computed the frequency of each triangle in mul-\ntisetM, calculated the probabilities for each triangle under\nthe joint and conditional models, and used the independence\nof triangles assumption to compute a probability estimate\nfor each MOP. We generated a new ranking R/primeof the MOPs\nfrom their probability estimates, and computed Spearman‚Äôs\nœÅand Kendall‚Äôs œÑranking correlation coefÔ¨Åcients for Rver-\nsusR/primeusing lengths of note sequences between 10 and 50,\nand standard deviations œÉfor the normal distribution vary-\ning between 1 and 20. œÉdetermines the number of analyses\nrranked inRandR/primeby the formula r‚âà4.66œÉ+ 1.65. In\nother words, when œÉ= 1, the random procedure only se-\nlects Ô¨Åve or six analyses from the 1,000 available in A, but\nwhenœÉ= 20 , approximately 95 are selected.\nFigure 3 shows heatmaps for œÅ; darker values are closer\nto 1, indicating R/primebeing closer to R. The heatmaps for\nœÑare similar. For the joint model, mean values of (œÅ,œÑ)\nare(0.9630,0.8848) while for the conditional model they\nare(0.9478,0.8286) , indicating that the joint model slightly\noutperforms the conditional model.\n101520253035404550number of notes1234567891011121314151617181920standard deviationSpearman's rho, joint triangle model\n101520253035404550number of notes1234567891011121314151617181920standard deviationSpearman's rho, cond. triangle model\nœÅ ‚àà [0.7814, 1.0] œÅ ‚àà [0.8175, 1.0] \nFigure 3 . The joint model reproduces the ground-truth rank-\ning slightly better than the conditional model.\nAssuming independence among the triangles in a MOP\nprovides us with an algorithm for calculating the most prob-\nable MOP, regardless of whether we choose the joint or con-\nditional models for the probability of an individual triangle,\nor some other model of triangle probability. Because con-\nstructing a MOP is equivalent to triangulating a simple con-\nvex polygon, we may take advantage of the fact that this\noptimal triangulation problem can be solved in O(n3)time\nusing a Viterbi-like dynamic programming algorithm where\nnis the number of notes in the composition. We will referto this algorithm as O PT-MOP.\n6. EVALUATION\nTo evaluate O PT-MOPand the suitability of the joint and\nconditional triangle models, we performed a leave-one-out\ncross-validation test. We generated 1,000 optimal analyses\nof the MOPs contained in each of the eight excerpts in our\ncorpus by using, for each excerpt, triangle probabilities de-\nrived only from the ground-truth analyses of the other seven\nexcerpts. We needed to compute multiple optimal analyses\nas occasionally ties appeared among the probabilities; O PT-\nMOPbroke these ties randomly. Additionally, we generated\n1,000 analyses uniformly at random for each excerpt.\nTo measure the quality of a candidate analysis A, we cal-\nculated the number of triangles in Athat were compatible\nwith the corresponding ground-truth analysis. We say a tri-\nangle is compatible with the ground-truth if it is present in\nthe ground-truth (the three speciÔ¨Åc notes of the excerpt are\ntriangulated the same way in both analyses), or if there is\nnothing in the ground-truth analysis that would prevent such\na triangle from appearing in the ground-truth. The second\nprovision is required because the ground-truth is human-\nproduced and may contain prolongations that do not specify\na complete triangulation. Therefore, any triangle that could\nresult from further triangulation is deemed compatible.\nWe compared the mean percentage of compatible trian-\ngles in the optimal analyses with the corresponding per-\ncentage for the random analyses. Comparisons were done\nseparately for the joint and conditional models. Table 4\nshows the mean compatibility percentages under both mod-\nels, along with a p-value calculated under the null hypoth-\nesis that the O PT-MOPdoes not perform better than ran-\ndom. These data indicate that both models perform better\nthan random as a whole, because if the null hypothesis were\ntrue, we would expect only one of the eight pieces to have\nap-value less than 0.1 for either model. Furthermore, the\njoint model outperforms the conditional model on average.\nThere are a number of possible reasons why the results\nare not better. First, the ground-truth analyses are not com-\npletely triangulated, and this puts an upper bound on how\nwell O PT-MOPcan improve over random analyses. As an\nextreme example, if a MOP were not triangulated at all, then\nall triangles produced by any analysis algorithm would be\ncompatible with the ground-truth, and therefore both O PT-\nMOP‚Äôs analyses and the random analyses would both obtain\nscores of 100%.\nSecond, it is not surprising that a training set of only\nseven pieces (due to leaving one out) did not appear to cap-\nture all of the statistical regularities of Schenkerian analysis.\nOur corpus is the largest available and we are actively en-\ngaged in increasing its size. We are gathering analyses from\nmusic journals, textbooks, and Schenker‚Äôs own published\n397Poster Session 3\nModel:Mozart, Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331, IMozart, Piano Sonata in B-Ô¨Çat major, K. 333, IIIMozart, Piano Sonata in C major, K. 545, IIIMozart, 6 Variations on an Allegretto, K.

Third, we cannot overlook the possibility that O PT-\nMOPcannot produce a good analysis due to the model mak-\ning incorrect assumptions or being too simplistic. Along\nwith gathering more data, we are also working to improve\nour model of the analysis procedure.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nOur work shows that actual Schenkerian analyses have sta-\ntistical regularities that can be represented, discovered, and\nreproduced. We have shown statistically signiÔ¨Åcant regu-\nlarities in a data set of Schenkerian analyses and illustrated\nhow those regularities may be exploited to design an algo-\nrithm for automatic analysis. Our experiment in ranking\nMOPs illustrates that assuming independence among the tri-\nangles comprising a MOP results in a satisfactory approxi-\nmation to the joint probability of all the triangles. The prob-\nabilities of individual triangles in a MOP may be deÔ¨Åned in\nnumerous ways; in the future, we plan on collecting more\ncontextual information surrounding prolongations, such as\nmetrical positioning and harmonic information, and using\nthese features to derive better probabilities over triangles.\n8.

The \nsubjective quality of a musician‚Äôs performance is more \ncomplicated still, with assumed contributions from  pitch  or \nintonation , loudness, timbre and likely other unknown fa c-\ntors [3].  \nThe goal of this stu dy is to determine the feasibility  for \ncomputer analysis of performance quality . Given  sufficient \ntraining data,  is it possible  for a computer to identify good \nand poor quality notes  so as  to give feedback  to student  \nmusician s or for other pedagogical purposes. ? This study \nalso serves to create a dataset on which the signal comp o-\nnents of tone quality  may be examined . The work was carried out by recording isolated notes \nplayed on trumpet by players with a range of experience , \ncollecting subjective ratings of quality from human su b-\njects, and training a classifier to identify note quality using \nextracted  audio features . Because each of the notes were \nrated and analyzed in isolation, (i.e. as a single note without \naccompaniment or directed comparison ), the note quality  \njudgements  in question are not likely to be affected by  into-\nnation , nor would they be related to other aspects of note \nquality dependent  on musical context . \n1.2 Tone Quality  \nTimbre is frequently defined as the differences between two \nsounds of t he same pitch and loudness . This study was d e-\nsigned to isolate tone quality differences between notes of \nsimilar pitch, dyna mics, and instrument.  While n umerous  \nstudies have attempted to determine the comp onents  of \ntimbre  that differentiate  instruments an d sounds  [5-7], few \nstudies have examined the auditory differences contributing \nto judgments of performance quality of tones.  These  stu-\ndies most often  use a technique called perceptual scaling to \nidentify  principal  dime nsions of timbre  which generally \naligned with  the spectral content, the temp oral change in \nthe spectrum , and the quality of the attack  [6,8] . With \nacoustically produced musical tones, however, t hese factors \nare interdepende nt and affect the perception of one another .  \nThe contribution and inseparability  of the different \ncomponents of the sound is also found in pedagogical lit e-\nrature. I n his instructional book  on the trumpet , Delbert \nDale says, ‚Äïthe actual s ound of the attack (the moment the \nsound bursts out of the instrument) has a great deal to do \nwith the sound of the remainder of th e tone ‚Äîat least to the \nlistener ‚Äñ [9].   \nThe few studies t hat have examined tone quality looked \nat specific  aspects of the notes. Madsen and Geringer [4] \nexamined preferences for ‚Äïgood‚Äñ and ‚Äïbad‚Äñ tone quality in \ntrumpet performa nce. Though the  two tone qualities were \naudibly distinguishable when presented without accomp a-\nniment, the only difference their published analysis di s-\ncussed was the amplitude of the second funda mental . In a \ndifferent study, an equalizer was used to amplify or dampen \nthe third through eleventh  harmonics of recorded tones to \nbe rated in  tone quality  [10]. For the brass instruments  \nnotes , a darker  tone, caused by  dampened  harmonics , was  \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distribu ted for profit or commercial advantage and that co p-\nies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011  International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n573Poster Session 4\n  \n \njudged to have a lowe r tone quality than the stan dard or \nbright ened  condition s. \nThe factors other than the amplitudes of the harmonics \naffect  tone quality , and a n examination of these  is wa r-\nranted. For the trum pet, tone quality is a product of the \n‚Äïbalance and coordination‚Äñ of embouchure, the oral cavity, \nand the airst ream  [11]. While ‚Äïno two persons have the \nsame or even similar tonal ideals‚Äñ [9] and the standard for \ngood and bad ton e quality varies ,  common problems  such \nas ‚Äïa shrill piercing quality in the upper register, and a \nfuzzy and unclear tone in the lower regi ster‚Äñ [9] have been \nidentif ied. \nThe goal of this study is to therefore see if it is possible  \nto train a classifier tha t can use extracted audio features to \nmake judgements about note quality consistent with aver-\nage human judgement s despite  such variable and subjective \ncriteria.  The instructions given to our human participants \n(described later) are therefore inte ntionally vague to avoid  \nbiasing or limiting judgements  and to avoid prescribing a \ndefinition of tone quality.   \n2. METHODS  \n2.1 Recordings  \nRecordings  of the t rumpet tones  took place in a room d e-\nsigned for performance recording . The position s of the m i-\ncrophones, music stand, and player  were the same for all \nrecordings. Recordings were done using a cartioid micro-\nphone (DPA  4011 -TL, Alleroed , Denmark) and a two \nchannel recorder ( Sound Devices 744T , Reedsburg, Wi s-\nconsin)  at a bit depth of 24 and a sample rate of 48 kHz.  \nThe players had a range of experience and education on the \ntrumpet . Player 1 is  a musician whose primary instrument is \nthe trombone and only pl ayed trumpet for this study . Player \n2 is a trumpet player with twelve years of private lessons \nand regular ensemble performances  at the university level \nboth of which , however,  ceased two years ago . Player 3 is \ncurrently an undergrad uate music perfo rmance  major who \nplays regularly with the university o rchestra . Player 4  has \nbeen playing for 14 years with no i nstruction at the unive r-\nsity level but with frequent live jazz performances .  \nThe recorded phrases were  three lines consisting of four \nhalf notes (minims) separat ed by half rests (minim rests) . \nThe same valve combination was repeated in the low range \n(A, Bb, B, C), mid range (E, F, F#, G), and high range (E, \nF, F#, G)  and the players were instructed on which valves \nto use when a choice existed . Before recor ding eac h line, \nthe players were given four clicks of a metr onome at 60 \nbpm.  The three lines were  played  with instructed dynamic \nlevels of piano,  then repeated at  mezzo -forte  and fortissimo.   \nWith the exception of the trombon e player , the mus i-\ncians all recorded on their own trumpet and mouthpi ece as \nwell as a control trumpet (Conn Director, Conn -Selmer , \nElkhart, Indiana) and mouthpiece  (Bach 7C, Conn -Selmer) . \nThat is to say, three players recorded twelve notes at three different dynamic levels on two trumpets for a contribution \nof 214 notes. The trombone player , player 1, could not play \nthe highest four notes and therefore  contributed just eight \nnotes at three dynamic levels on one trumpet for a total of \n24 notes. One note from the dataset was excluded due to \ncomputer error so t he total dataset had 239 notes .  \n2.2 Labeling  \nIndividual notes were manually  excised from the recordings  \nto make discrete stimuli for subjective rating . Five brass \nplayers (three  trum pet players, one  trombone  player , and \none French horn player , all undergraduate or graduate m u-\nsic students with extensive performance experience ) pro-\nvided subjective labeling of the quality of the notes  on a \ndiscrete  scale from 1 to 7 with 1 labeled as ‚Äïworst‚Äñ and 7 \nlabeled  ‚Äïbest.‚Äñ The raters were instructed to listen to the \nnote as many times as they wanted  and to make a subjective \nrating of the note using anything they could hear and any \ncriteria  they deemed im portant , including their specific \nknowledge of brass  instruments  and the dynamic level . The \nnotes were presented in three blocks  (all the piano notes, all \nthe mezzo -forte notes, all the fortissimo notes) but were \nrandomized within  each block .  \nNote quality judgements varied greatly per rater, as  ex-\npected. While the intersubject ratings correlat ions averaged \nat r=0.5 0, some stimuli were rated more consistently than \nothers. Dividing the 239 notes on the median standard dev i-\nation  of 1.14 (on the discrete range of 1 to 7), the intersu b-\nject co rrelations on the more consistent subset of 118 (less \nthan or equal to  1.14)  averaged to r  = 0.79. In co ntrast, the \nintersubject correlations  on the remaining 121 stimuli ave r-\naged at r  = 0.13, and failed to  correlate  signif icantly  (i.e., \nwith p<0.05 ) in 6 of 10 pair wise comparisons. Most of the  \nbulge in the  distribution of rounded average ratings, shown \nin figure 1 , is due to these notes of amb iguous quality  as \nthey averag e to 4 or 5  with a couple dozen 3 s and 6 s. In the \nfollowing analysis, all notes were represented only by their \naverage rating  across the five raters . The distribution  of av-\neraged ratings of the dataset is shown in Figure 1. \n2.3 Feature Extraction  \nWhile studies have examined appropriate features for ti m-\nbre recognition [12], timbre is just a subset of what pote n-\ntially makes up the quality of a note. The extracted audio \nfeatures we re therefore widely selected, using 56 different \nfeatures, of which  6 were  multidimensional  A complete list \nis given in the appendix. jAudio was used for feature e x-\ntraction .[13] \n \n57412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n \nFigure 1.  Histogram of the rounded average ratings  from \nall raters and showing  the contribution  from each player . \n2.4 Learning  \n2.4.1 Classifier Choice  \nACE (Autonomous Classification Engine) 2.0 , software \nused for testing, training, and running classifiers  [14] was \nused throughout the study for these purposes. ACE was \nused to experiment with different classifiers including k -\nnearest neighbour, support vector machines ( SVMs),  sever-\nal types of decision trees,  and neural  networks  on a couple \nsubsets of the data . .SVMs  tended to perform best  on these \nsubsets. . For this reason and because of the relative inte r-\nchangability of these techniques , SVMs  were  used throug h-\nout th is study . In multi -class situations, ho wever, SVMs do \nnot encode an ordering of classes  which makes the task \nslightly more difficult in the three and se ven-class problems \ndiscussed belo w. \n2.4.2 Groupings  \nDifferent groupings of the notes were used to test the acc u-\nracy of the classifiers, including  two, three, and seven \nclasses. While the judgments  from the five raters were only \ninteger values, e ach note was represented by a single ave r-\nage rati ng across all the  raters and was therefore often a d e-\ncimal number.  The notes were a ssigned to classes based on \nthis average rating.  \nTwo-class  problems were evaluated  for three diffe rent \ngroupings . The first grouping  takes just the ex tremes of the \ndata: the ‚Äïgood‚Äñ class only has average ra tings above 5.5 \nand the ‚Äïbad‚Äñ class has average ratings below 2.5 , exclu d-\ning all points in between . The second grouping is more i n-\nclusive, including all data below 3.5 for ‚Äïbad‚Äñ an d above \n4.5 for ‚Äïgood,‚Äñ again e xcluding data in between. The last \ngrouping includes all the data, split at the median rating, \n4.6. The distribution of this labeling is shown in Figure 2.  Secondly, a grouping of three classes was also ev a-\nluated, splitting  the data approximately into three groups, \nbelow 4.2, above or equal to 5.2, and the points in between.  \nLastly,  rounding the averaged ratings into the nearest \ncategory produced seven classes of data with labels 1 to 7. \nThe distribution of this class is the  same as seen in Figure \n1. \n2.4.3 Other tests  \nFurthermore, to test the performance of  the classifier on \nnotes from a n unseen player we used a leave -one-player -out \nmethodology. To do this, we repeated the above tests using \nthree of the players to train and finding  the success of cla s-\nsification on the fourth player. Because of the dominance of \nplayer 1 in ratings less than 2.5, we tested the seven class \ntest with and without player 1 and did not test the two class \nproblem using just the extremes of data (points less  than 2.5 \nand greater than 5.5).  \nA classifier was also trained to test the possibility of \ndiscriminating between performers. To do this, each note \nwas labeled only with a performer number, 1 through 4.  \n \n \nFigure 2: The distribution of the two cla sses when  using all \nof the data, divided at the  medan rating of 4.6.  \n3. RESULT S \nFor the two class problems, the most extreme data resulted \nin the highest success rate and increasing the inclusion of \nthe classes lowered the average success of the five-fold \ncross validation.  These results are summarized in Table 1.  \nFor the three class problem, with a five -fold cross val i-\ndation, an SVM correctly identified the class on average \n54.0% of the tones .

DISCUSSION  \nThe classifiers show a surprising ability to discriminate b e-\ntween classes based on the extracted features with two, \nthree, and seven classes. Even with seven classes, the cla s-\nsifier identified the correct  class 46% of the time, which is \nbetter than chance or the success rate expected from pic k-\ning the most common class (36%). This shows promise for \nthe possibility to train a classifier to give automatic fee d-\nback on student musicians‚Äô performance.  \nThere are , however,  severe limitations to this data se t. \nBecause there are only four players in the data set, each \nwith a distinct distribution of notes, there may be latent fe a-\ntures unrelated to performance quality that can help narrow  \nthe selection of class  and im prove classifier success . This \nhypothesis is bolstered by the high success in performer  \nidentification task . For comparison, a 1 -note attempt at \nidentifying the correct performer out of three possible pe r-\nformers gave at best a 43% success in a previous stu dy \n[15].  \nThe classifier‚Äôs success with the subset of 118 notes \nwith rating standard deviation less than or equal to 1.14 was \nnot different than the dataset as a whole. This seems to i n-\ndicate th e classifier is not using the same cues or salient \n57612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nfeatures that allowed or encouraged agreement between the \nraters.  \nThe results for the leave -one-player -out task decreased \nsharply compared to the result using all players and testing \nwith cross -validation.  This could be because of the distinct \ndistribution of each player and/or other distinct features that \nidentify one performer compared to another.  \nIn the seven class identification task, m athematically, \nfor a note to be considered of class one (or 7 ) there had to \nbe strong agreement among the raters, as at least 3 of the \nraters had to rate that note as class one. This distinctively \nbad performance of class 1 notes probably led to the rel a-\ntively high success in identifying them (8 out of 11 correct) \ncompared to, for example,  class 2 which had no correct \nidentifications.  As well, because player 1 was not able to \nrecord the top four notes of the exercise, having a higher \npitch note skews the rating towards the upper end of ra t-\nings.  \nFurther work is needed  to examine the robustness of \nthese results with more players and with different recording \ncondit ions, such as notes of varying duration, or using \nphrases  of several notes . \n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThough all music traditions share common characteristics,\neach one can be recognized by particular features that need\nto be identiÔ¨Åed and preserved. The information technolo-\ngies used for music processing have typically targeted the\nwestern music traditions, and current research is emphasiz-\ning this bias even more. However, to develop technologies\nthat can deal with the richness of our world‚Äôs music, we\nneed to study and exploit the unique aspects of other mu-\nsical cultures. By looking at the problems emerging from\nvarious musical cultures we will not only help those speciÔ¨Åc\ncultures, but we will open up our computational methodolo-\ngies, making them much more versatile. In turn, we will\nhelp preserve the diversity of our world‚Äôs culture [26].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.The two classical music traditions of the Indian subconti-\nnent, Hindustani1and Carnatic2, are among the oldest mu-\nsic and most unique traditions still alive. There are excellent\nmusicological and cultural studies about them, they main-\ntain performance practice traditions and they exist within\nreal social contexts. Thus, they are an excellent ground on\nwhich to build new information models and a way to chal-\nlenge the dominant western-centred paradigms. In this arti-\ncle we focus on Carnatic music, the tradition of south-India.\nCarnatic music shares with the Hindustani tradition some\nbasic foundations, such as the basic elements of shruti (the\nrelative musical pitch), swara (the musical sound of a sin-\ngle note), raaga (the melodic mode), and taala (the rhythmic\npattern). Although improvisation plays an important role,\nCarnatic music is mainly sung through compositions, dif-\nferently from Hindustani music where improvisation is fun-\ndamental. Carnatic music is usually performed by a small\nensemble of musicians, consisting of a principal performer\n(usually a vocalist), a melodic accompaniment (usually a\nviolin), a rhythm accompaniment (usually a mridangam),\nand a tambura, which acts as a drone throughout the per-\nformance. Other typical instruments used in Carnatic per-\nformances may include the ghatam, kanjira, morsing, veena\nand Ô¨Çute.\nThe computational study of Carnatic music offers a num-\nber of problems that require new research approaches. Its\ninstruments emphasize sonic characteristics that are quite\nparticular and not well understood yet. The concepts of\nraaga and taala are completely different to the western con-\ncepts used to describe melody and rhythm. Carnatic mu-\nsic scores serve a different purpose to those of western mu-\nsic. The tight musical and sonic relationship between the\nsinging voice, the other melodic instruments and the percus-\nsion accompaniment within a song, requires going beyond\nthe modular approaches commonly used in music informa-\ntion research (MIR). The special and participatory commu-\nnication established between performers and audience in con-\ncerts, offers great opportunities to study issues of social cog-\n1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani classical music\n2http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic music\n263Poster Session 2\nnition. Its devotional aim is fundamental to understand the\nmusic. The study of the song lyrics is also essential to under-\nstand the rhythmic, melodic and timbre aspects of Carnatic\nmusic. And many more interesting music aspects could be\nidentiÔ¨Åed of relevance to music information processing.\nIn the next section we focus on the melodic aspects of\nCarnatic music, over-viewing the theoretical aspects that are\nrelevant for MIR and discussing the scarce computational\napproaches that have been presented. In the last section we\npresent open issues that have not yet been addressed and that\nwe believe are important to be worked on.\n2. COMPUTATIONAL APPROACHES TO MELODY\nThe most fundamental melodic concept in Indian classical\nmusic is raaga. Matanga is the Ô¨Årst known person to deÔ¨Åne\nwhat a raaga is [28]: ‚ÄúIn the opinion of the wise, that par-\nticularity of notes and melodic movements, or that distinc-\ntion of melodic sound by which one is delighted, is raaga‚Äù.\nTherefore, the raaga is neither a tune nor a scale [18]. It is\na set of rules which can together be called a melodic frame-\nwork. The notion that a raaga is not just a sequence of notes\nis important in understanding it and for developing compu-\ntational models. Also the concept of raga has been chang-\ning with time. Nowadays a given raaga can be described\nby properties such as: a set of notes (swaras), their progres-\nsions (arohana/avarohana), the way they are intonated using\nvarious movements (gamakaas), and their relative position,\nstrength and duration (types of swaras). In order to identify\nraagas computationally, swara intonation, scale, note pro-\ngressions and characteristic phrases are used (Secs. 2.1 and\n2.2). Unexploited properties of a raaga include gamakaas\nand the various roles the swaras play (Sec. 2.3).\n2.1 Swaras and shrutis\nIn Indian music, swaras are the seven notes in the scale, de-\nnoted by Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da and Ni3[27]. Except for\nthe tonic and the Ô¨Åfth, all the other swaras have two varia-\ntions each, which account for 12 notes in an octave, called\nswarasthanas. There are three kinds of scales that one gener-\nally encounters in Carnatic and Hindustani music theory: a\n12-note scale, a 16-note scale and the scale which claims 22\nshrutis4. The 16-note scale is the same as the 12-note scale\nexcept that 4 of the 12 notes have two names each, in order\nto be backward compatible with an older nomenclature.\nFew musicians and scholars claim that there are more\nshrutis in practice than those explained above. Though many\nof them argue the total number to be 22, that itself is de-\nbated [9]. A more important question to be asked is whether\nthey are used in current practice at all. Some musicologists\nsay that they are no more used [21]. It is also said that\n3This notation is analogous to e.g. Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La and Ti.\n4Shruti is the least perceptible interval as deÔ¨Åned in Natyasastra [22].they are wrongly attributed to Bharata, who used shruti to\nmean ‚Äúthe interval between two notes such that the differ-\nence between them is perceptible‚Äù. Krishnaswamy [13] ar-\ngues that the microtonal intervals observed in Carnatic mu-\nsic are the perceptual phenomena caused by the gamakaas,\ni.e. that these microtonal intervals are what few scholars and\nmusicians claim as 22 shrutis. However, we believe that\nthese claims need to be veriÔ¨Åed with perceptual and be-\nhavioural studies. In our encounters with most musicians,\nwe can only conclude that they are unaware of the usage of\n22 shrutis in practice. Few musicians who claim they are\nused, are not ready to demonstrate them in a raaga. In gen-\neral, more empirical, quantitative and large-scale evidence\nneeds to be gathered. Our preliminary research on this line\nshows no support for the usage of 22 shrutis [25].\nThe tuning itself, whether it is just-intonation or equi-\ntempered, is an issue of debate5[12, 25]. Since Indian\nclassical music is an orally transmitted tradition, perception\nplays a vital role. For instance, tuning seldom involves an\nexternal tool. And even the tambura, which is used as a\ndrone, and thus as a reference for tuning, has a very unsta-\nble frequency. Hence the analysis of empirical data coupled\nwith perceptual studies are important. In [25] we have car-\nried out an empirical analysis of the stable tunings employed\nby some Carnatic and Hindustani singers. The results sug-\ngest a clear tendency towards just-intonation in the case of\nCarnatic music while, at the same time, they point out to a\nstrong inÔ¨Çuence of equi-tempered tuning in the case of Hin-\ndustani music.\nFixed tunings are not the whole story. In fact, it is a well\naccepted notion that a note (swarasthana) is a region rather\nthan a point [7,27]. Thus, a Ô¨Åxed, stable tuning for each note\nis not as important as it is in, say, western classical music.\nIn addition, Sa, the tonic, can be any frequency. It depends\non the comfort of the singer or the choice of the instrument\nplayer. A given note can have several variations in intona-\ntion depending on the raaga. This variability in intonation\narises from vocal articulations or the pulling of instrument\nstrings. Even if two raagas have the same scale, the intona-\ntion of notes vary signiÔ¨Åcantly. Belle et al [2] have used this\nclue to differentiate raagas that share the same scale. They\nevaluated their system on 10 audio excerpts accounting for\n2 distinct scale groups (two raagas each). They showed that\nthe use of swara intonation features improved the accuracies\nachieved with pitch-class distributions (c.f. [3]). This clearly\nindicates that intonation differences are signiÔ¨Åcant to under-\nstanding and modeling raagas computationally. Levy [16]\nanalyses the intonation in Hindustani raaga performances\nand notes that it is highly variable, and that it does not seem\nto agree with any standard tuning system. Subramanian [33]\nreports much the same for Carnatic music. These studies\ncall for the need to understand the extent to which a given\n5http://cnx.org/content/m12459/1.11\n26412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nRaaga Singer Tested Correctly\nidentiÔ¨Åed\nSankarabharanam Nithyasree 5 4\nSubbulakshmi 3 2\nBalamurali 2 1\nKanakangi Nithyasree 8 6\nIlayaraja 2 1\nKaraharapriya Nithyasree 10 6\nTable 1 . Results of Rajeswari & Geeta‚Äôs raaga identiÔ¨Åcation\nmethod.\nnote can be intonated. In particular, this could be of interest\nto differentiate artists and styles.\nAll these works indicate that a complete characteriza-\ntion of swarasthanas must go beyond static frequency mea-\nsurements and that their dynamics need to be considered.\nThe problem implies much more than trying to discriminate\nwhether swarasthanas are tuned to just-intonation, equi-tem-\npered or following 22 shrutis. Much empirical data like the\none reported in [33] and [16] needs to be gathered to investi-\ngate the intervals, the range of intonations and the temporal\nevolution of each swarasthana.\n2.2 Arohana and avarohana\nTypically, a raaga is represented using ascending (arohana)\nand descending (avarohana) progressions of notes. There\nare certain note transition rules that are necessary to be fol-\nlowed when performing a raaga. The set of unique notes\nin these progressions form a scale. For raaga identiÔ¨Åcation,\nRajeswari et al [31] estimate the scale from the given tune\nby comparing it with template scales. Their test data con-\nsists of 30 tunes in 3 raagas sung by 4 artists. They use\nthe harmonic product spectrum algorithm [15] to extract the\npitch, giving the tonic manually. The other frequencies in\nthe scale are marked down based on the respective ratio with\nthe tonic. The results obtained are shown in Table 1, which\ndepicts a 67% accuracy. The authors claim that such a low\naccuracy could be due to discrepancies in the manually fed\ntonic. But considering that their system identiÔ¨Åes only the\nswaras that are used in a raaga and no other relevant data, the\nresult shows that the swaras alone can be very useful. How-\never, there are raagas which have the same swaras (since the\nscales of the raagas they considered are different, this is not\nan issue in their study).\nShetty et al [29] use a similar approach when they try\nto recognize raagas. The features extracted are the individ-\nual swaras and their relation in arohana-avarohana (swara\npairs). The features are represented as bit sequences which\nare later converted to decimal values. These features are\nused for training a neural network. They report an accuracyof 95% over 90 tunes from 50 raagas, using 60 tunes as train-\ning data and the remaining 30 tunes as test data. However,\nsuch a high accuracy is questionable due to the few data per\nclass used. Moreover, no cross-fold validation was done.\nSahasrabudde et al [23] model the raaga as Ô¨Ånite automa-\nta. A Ô¨Ånite automata has a set of states between which the\ntransitions take place. In the case of raaga, the swarasthanas\nare the states and the note transitions are observed. This idea\nis used to generate a number of audio samples for a raaga,\nwhich they claim are technically correct and indistinguish-\nable from human compositions. Inspired by this, Pandey et\nal[17] use HMM models to recognize the raagas. The rules\nto form a melodic sequence for a given raaga are well de-\nÔ¨Åned in the musicology literature [24] and the number of\nnotes is Ô¨Ånite. Therefore, intuitively, HMM models should\nbe good at capturing those rules in note transitions imposed\nby arohana and avarohana patterns (at least the Ô¨Årst-order,\nsimpler ones).\nEach raaga has also a few characteristic phrases. They\nare called swara sancharas in Carnatic and pakads in Hin-\ndustani. These phrases are said to be very crucial for con-\nveying the feeling of the raaga [9]. Typically, in a concert,\nthe artist starts by singing these phrases. They are the main\nclues for the listeners to identify which raaga it is. Pandey et\nalhave complemented their approach with values obtained\nfrom two modules that match characteristic phrases, taking\nadvantage of this information. In one such module, char-\nacteristic phrases are identiÔ¨Åed with a substring matching\nalgorithm. In the other one, they are identiÔ¨Åed by counting\nthe occurrences of frequency n-grams in the phrase.\nThe other important contributions by Pandey et al in-\nclude two heuristics to improve the transcription of Indian\nclassical music: the hill peak heuristic and the note dura-\ntion heuristic. As mentioned, Indian music has a lot of mi-\ncro tonal variations which makes even the monophonic note\ntranscription a challenging problem [17]. The two heuristics\nproposed in their approach try to get through these micro\ntonal Ô¨Çuctuations in attaining a better transcription. The hill\npeak heuristic states that a signiÔ¨Åcant change in the slope of\na pitch contour (or the sign reversal of such slope) is closely\nassociated with the presence of a note. The note duration\nheuristic considers only the notes that are played for at least\na certain span of time. The approach was tested on two raa-\ngas. Table 2 shows the results obtained by using HMMs\nalone, and by complementing the models with characteristic\nphrase matching. Not much can be said about the reliability\nof the features they used since the number of classes con-\nsidered were just two. But the advantage of characteristic\nphrase matching is evident.\nSinith et al [30] also used HMMs of raagas to search for\nmusical patterns in a catalogue of monophonic Carnatic mu-\nsic. They build models for 6 typical music patterns corre-\nsponding to 6 raagas (they report a 100% accuracy in iden-\n265Poster Session 2\nRaaga Samples HMM HMM +\nPhrase matching\nYaman Kalyan 15 80% 80%\nBhupali 16 75% 94%\nTotal 31 77% 87%\nTable 2 . Accuracy of raaga identiÔ¨Åcation reported in [17].\ntifying an unknown number of tunes into 6 raagas). HMMs\nare also used by Das and Choudary [6] to automatically gen-\nerate Hindustani classical music.\nChordia and Rae [3] use pitch class proÔ¨Åles and bi-grams\nof pitches to classify raagas. The dataset used in their sys-\ntem consists of 72 minutes of monophonic instrumental (sa-\nrod) data in 17 raagas played by a single artist. Again, the\nharmonic product spectrum algorithm [15] is used to extract\nthe pitch. Note onsets are detected by observing the sudden\nchanges in the phase and the amplitude of the signal. Then,\nthe pitch-class proÔ¨Åles and the bi-grams are calculated. It\nis shown that bi-grams are useful in discriminating the raa-\ngas with the same scale. They use several classiÔ¨Åers com-\nbined with dimensionality reduction techniques. The feature\nvector size is reduced from 144 (bi-grams) + 12 (pitch pro-\nÔ¨Åle) to 50 with principal-component analysis. Using just the\npitch class proÔ¨Åles, the system achieves an accuracy of 75%.\nUsing only bi-grams of pitches, the accuracy is 82%. Best\naccuracy of 94% is achieved using a maximum a posteriori\nrule with a multi-variate likelihood model. Comparison to\nother classiÔ¨Åers is shown in [3].\n2.3 Unexploited properties of raaga\n2.3.1 Gamakaas\nIn Carnatic music the various forms of pitch movements\nare together called gamakaas. A sliding movement from\none note to another or a vibrato are examples of gamakaas.\nThere are various ways to group these movements, but the\nmost accepted classiÔ¨Åcation speaks of 15 types of gamakaas.\nGamakaas are not just decorative items or embellishments,\nbut very essential constituents of a raaga [9]. Each raaga\nhas some characteristic gamakaas. Thus, the detection of\ngamakaas is a crucial step to model and identify raagas.\nA gamakaa is often represented using discrete notes, but\nit does not necessarily mean that one plays them using dis-\ncrete steps. The representation is only a handy expression\nof a more continuous sounding pattern, which is difÔ¨Åcult\nto represent on the paper. A gamakaa is almost always a\nsmooth change in the dynamics of a pitch contour. Similar\nconcepts are used to describe the pitch inÔ¨Çections in Hin-\ndustani music [19]. Owing to their tremendous inÔ¨Çuence on\nhow a tune sounds, the gamakaas and the related pitch in-\nÔ¨Çections in Hindustani music are often considered the soulof Indian classical music.\nThere are two major issues that make identifying a gama-\nkaa a challenging problem. First, it requires a very precise\npitch transcription. Second, the variations found for differ-\nent artists in performing a gamakaa complicate it further.\nKrishnaswamy [14] and Subramanian [33] report such vari-\nations across different artists performing the same gamakaa.\nThey also propose some theoretical guidelines to resolve the\nsecond problem to some extent. These variations should\nbe exploited in performers‚Äô computational modeling, a Ô¨Åeld\nthat lacks much research in the case of Indian classical mu-\nsic.\n2.3.2 Various roles played by the notes\nIn a given raaga, not all the notes play the same role. Though\ntwo given raagas have the same set of constituent notes, their\nfunctionality can be very different, leading to a different\nfeeling altogether [34]. For example, some swaras occur\nfrequently, some are prolonged, some occur either at the be-\nginning or the end of the phrases, etc. In addition, there are\nalankaras, patterns of note sequences which are supposed to\nbeautify and instil feelings when listened to.\nThough emotion is a subjective issue, it gets into almost\nevery discussion involving raagas. That is because each\nraaga is said to evoke characteristic emotions. To test this\nhypothesis, Chordia and Rae [4] have conducted a survey\nto check whether Hindustani raagas elicit emotions consis-\ntently across listeners. Positive results are reported, jointly\nwith the musical properties like relative weight of the notes,\nwhich partially explain the phenomenon. Koduri et al [11]\nhave conducted a similar survey with Carnatic raagas. Though\nnot as signiÔ¨Åcant as the pattern reported by Chordia et al, the\nresults indicate that Carnatic raagas elicit emotions which\nare consistent across listeners. Wieczorkowska et al [35]\ntests if raagas elicit emotions, and also arrive at a mapping\nbetween melodic sequences of 3 or 4 notes and the elicited\nemotions. Their work suggests that different compositions\nin the same raaga might elicit different emotions, what is\nconsistent with the observations made by Koduri et al [11].\nWieczorkowska et al note that these melodic sequences are\nrelated vaguely to the subjects‚Äô emotional responses. Anoth-\ner interesting observation is the signiÔ¨Åcance in the similar-\nity between the responses of people from various cultures,\nwhich is consistent with the observations made in a previous\nstudy conducted by Balkwill et al [1].\n3. OPEN ISSUES: GAMAKAAS, TAALAS,\nINSTRUMENTS AND IMPROVISATION\nLittle research has been carried out on Carnatic music and\neven less on the speciÔ¨Åc characteristics that makes it so spe-\ncial. Few proposed computational approaches have focused\non raaga recognition and the results are quite preliminary\n26612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ngiven that the data used is not representative of the exist-\ning variety of raagas. The high accuracies reported might\nbe due to the limited number of raagas used and the small\nsizes of the datasets. Moreover, important properties of the\nraagas, like their speciÔ¨Åc use of gamakaas, have not been\nexploited yet, and issues beyond recognition have neither\nbeen approached. We hypothesize that, as more represen-\ntative datasets are gathered, the features used will not be\nsufÔ¨Åcient to discriminate the raaga classes. Features such as\npitch-class proÔ¨Åles and pitch-class dyad distributions infer\npartial information about the raagas. But the other roles of\nnotes are not evident, which need to be exploited. Symbolic\nscores can also be used for building more complex models,\nespecially to model the characteristic melodic movements\nof particular raagas.\nWhile raaga is the fundamental concept related to melody,\ntaala is the fundamental concept related to rhythm [34]. A\ntaala is a rhythmic cycle, which is divided into speciÔ¨Åc un-\neven sections, each of them subdivided into even measures.\nThe Ô¨Årst beat of each taala section is accented, with notable\nmelodic and percussive events. The characteristics of a taala\nare related to the main instrument used to emphasize the\nrhythmic aspect in a song, the mridangam. Understanding\nthe acoustics of the mridangam and how it is played, is fun-\ndamental to model the taalas. Sambamoorty [24] lists all\ntaalas and provides the description for each. The recog-\nnition of the different types of strokes to play the mridan-\ngam, bols, is an open topic. Current MIR research on drum\ntranscription uses small numbers of drum stroke classes and\neach class is associated with a speciÔ¨Åc (single) drum, usu-\nally based on the typical western drum set. With mridan-\ngam, multiple bols are associated to each drum, and given\nthat is a tuned instrument, the recognition of the bols have to\ntake into account both timbre and pitch information. Some\nwork has been done on the recognition of bols in Hindus-\ntani music, with the tabla [8] [5], but no research has been\ncarried out in Carnatic music, with the mridangam. There\nis also no research focusing on the recognition or classiÔ¨Å-\ncation of taalas. As the musician always tries to embellish\nthe taala, there is a strong variation from performance to\nperformance, and the rhythmic complexity obtained is enor-\nmous. The main goal would be to gain insensitivity to these\nvariations in order to classify taalas or, otherwise, to model\nthese variations for understanding performance and impro-\nvisation. For this research we need to use top-down or other\ncontextual information to make sense of the audio data, for\nexample there is a well-deÔ¨Åned structure to improvisation\nwhich should be exploited [9].\nWe have reported on previous work that has veriÔ¨Åed whe-\nther raagas elicit emotions and tried to map the musical fea-\ntures which are responsible for such phenomenon. Besides\nthe note sequences, another important aspect of Indian clas-\nsical music which could play a crucial role in eliciting emo-tions is gamakaa. However, there are no studies which re-\nport their effect so far. The kind of instruments used and the\nrhythmic aspects also need to be accounted when dealing\nwith emotional aspects.\nAt the level of musical instruments there is practically\nnothing done. Physical modeling of their many non-linear\nbehaviours is quite complex and the lack of instrument stan-\ndardization does not help. Some research has been done on\nmodeling north-Indian instruments like the tabla and sitar\n[10] and there have been a few attempts in developing sound\nsynthesis systems [32]. The timbre of the tambura is at\nthe basis of the Indian sound. It has a special overtone-\nrich sound, a sustained ‚Äùbuzzing‚Äù resulting from the wide\nand arched bridge on which the strings rests and of the cot-\nton thread placed between the strings and the bridge. This\ntype of string termination results in a quite complex acoustic\nsystem Ô¨Årst discussed by Nobel Prize winning physicists C\nV Raman [20] and for which current F0-detection methods\nperform very poorly.\nThe performance practice tradition has not been studied\nat all. Music performance is mainly learned by imitation,\nwithout much use of symbolic representations. The vari-\nability in performances of the same song is quite large, es-\npecially due to the importance of improvisation. The same\ncomposition sung by two artists can be different in many\nmusical and expressive facets. These differences may chal-\nlenge the version identiÔ¨Åcation methods developed for west-\nern commercial music. In addition to the compositional\nforms, there are many improvisatory forms that are perfor-\nmed with well-deÔ¨Åned structural criteria [9].\nThrough the article we have mentioned a number of char-\nacteristics of Carnatic music that deserve to be studied. Gi-\nven that this music tradition is so different from the ones\nused to develop the current computational methodologies,\nthere is a need to deal with some more fundamental issues\nrelated to music information processing. We need to study\nhow the musical concepts and terms in Indian music are un-\nderstood, specifying proper ontologies with which to frame\nour work. Also the cultural and community aspects of the\nmusic are so important that, without studying them, we will\nnot be able to develop proper musical models. In summary,\nto approach the computational modeling of Carnatic music,\nmaking justice to its richness, it is fundamental to take a\ncultural approach and, thus, take into account musicological\nand contextual information.\n4.

INTRODUCTION\nOntologies are used to represent knowledge in a formal\nway. For instance, they can be used to enable machines\nto make sense of the unstructured nature of informa-\ntion available on the Web. Compared to simple meta-\ndata encoding, ontologies provide meaning by deÔ¨Åning\nconcepts and relationships in an application domain, as\nwell as constraints on their use. Furthermore, they per-\nmit interoperability, automatic reasoning and access to\ninformation using complex queries.\nKnowledge representation in the domain of musical\ninstruments is a complex issue, involving a wide range\nof instrument characteristics, for instance, physical as-\npects of instruments such as different types of sound\ninitiation, resonators, as well as the player-instrument\nrelationship. Since the 19th century, numerous studies\ndeveloped systems for representing information about\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies\nare not made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and\nthat copies bear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.musical instruments, for instance, (ethno)musicologists\nhave been working on creating a common vocabulary,\nwhich represents all instruments with relevant charac-\nteristics in a systematic way. The classiÔ¨Åcation of in-\nstruments has also been investigated by organologists\nand museologists [8]. Hornobostel and Sachs [14] pro-\nposed a musical instrument classiÔ¨Åcation scheme as an\nextension of Mahillon‚Äôs scheme [9], originally designed\nto catalogue the worldwide collection of musical instru-\nments housed in the Brussels Conservatory Instrumen-\ntal museum.\nThe Hornobostel and Sachs classiÔ¨Åcation scheme (H-\nS system) relies on a downward taxonomy by logical di-\nvision. The method later coined Systematik by Dr ¬¥ager\n[4]. Although many attempts have since been made by\nscholars to improve the Hornobostel and Sachs‚Äô Sys-\ntematik, it is still predominant in museums around the\nworld. Kartomi [8] attributes the success of the classi-\nÔ¨Åcation system to the fact that it is essentially numer-\nical rather than lexical, making it an international sys-\ntem (e.g. 211.11-922 refers to the timpani or kettledrum\nin the H-S system). Elschek [5], was the Ô¨Årst to pro-\npose an upward method of classiÔ¨Åcation based on in-\nstrument attributes complementing downward classiÔ¨Å-\ncations schemes such as the Systematik.\nThe purpose of our paper is to investigate knowledge\nrepresentation issues of musical instruments on the Se-\nmantic Web, by taking various musical instrument clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation schemes into account. The rest of the pa-\nper is organised as follows: In section 2, we give an\noverview of the Semantic Web standards used in this\nstudy. In section 3, we describe the Music Ontology\nand the related instrument ontologies. In section 4, we\ndetail knowledge representation issues of various mu-\nsical instrument classiÔ¨Åcation schemes, and highlight\ntheir conceptual heterogeneities. In section 5, the OWL\nrepresentations of these classiÔ¨Åcation schemes are ex-\namined using SPARQL queries. Finally, in the section\n6, we note on further difÔ¨Åculties of the research prob-\nlem, and outline our future work.\n465Poster Session 3\n2. SEMANTIC WEB TECHNOLOGIES\nThe Semantic Web is an initiative of the World Wide\nWeb Consortium (W3C) which proposes standards un-\nderlying the technologies of the Web [10]. The W3C in-\nvestigates how to maintain interoperability and univer-\nsality of the Web using open standards and languages.\nThe technologies relevant in our examination of issues\nin musical instrument ontology design are presented in\nthis section.\nRDF: The Resource Description Framework (RDF)1\nis a simple data model, that associates subjects andob-\njects using a predicate . A series of connections can\nbe made using triples or three-tuple associations, which\nform a graph of semantic relationships. RDF is the basis\nfor more complex knowledge representation languages\nsuch as the RDF Schema Language (RDFS). See for in-\nstance [2] for more details.\nSKOS: The Simple Knowledge Organization Systems\n(SKOS)2is a semi-formal model for expressing con-\ntrolled vocabularies (classiÔ¨Åcation schemes, thesauri, tax-\nonomies) in RDF. It deÔ¨Ånes skos:Concept , whose\nindividuals may be associated with one or more lex-\nical labels, skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel\nand placed within a hierarchy using skos:broader ,\nskos:narrower , orskos:related properties, ex-\nhibiting a thesaurus model [1].\nOWL: The Ontology Web Language (OWL)3is a\na W3C recommendation for deÔ¨Åning and instantiating\nweb ontologies. Like RDFS, OWL permits the deÔ¨Å-\nnition of classes, properties and their instances, and is\nused to explicitly represent the meaning and relation-\nships of terms in vocabularies, and express constraints\non their use. Such a representation is called ontology.\nOWL has a richer vocabulary than RDFS and SKOS, for\nexample, for specifying cardinality, equality, character-\nistics of properties such as transitivity or symmetry and\nenumerated classes. [1].\nSPARQL: Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language\n(SPARQL)4deÔ¨Ånes a standard access protocol for RDF\nthat provides Semantic Web developers with a power-\nful tool to extract information from large data sets. A\nquery consists of several graph patterns, which can be\ncombined recursively to form arbitrarily complex query\npatterns. It may be used for any data source that can be\nmapped to RDF.\n1http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer\n2http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference\n3http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-primer\n4http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol3. RELATED WORK\nOur primary aim is to develop a semantically rich on-\ntology of instruments which can be used in conjunction\nwith the Music Ontology5. In this section, we outline\nthis ontology and previously published Semantic Web\nontologies of musical instruments.\nThe Music Ontology [13] provides a uniÔ¨Åed frame-\nwork for describing music-related information (i.e. ed-\nitorial data including artists, albums and tracks) on the\nWeb. It is built on several ontologies such as the Time-\nline Ontology6, the Event Ontology7, the Functional\nRequirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) On-\ntology8, and the Friend Of A Friend (FOAF) Ontol-\nogy9. It subsumes speciÔ¨Åc terms from these ontologies,\nuseful to describe music related data. The Timeline and\nEvent ontologies, can be used to localise events in space\nand time. The FRBR model links books and other in-\ntellectual works with their creators, publishers or sub-\njects, and provides a model to describe the life cycle of\nthese works. This is reused by the Music Ontology to\ndescribe the music production workÔ¨Çow from composi-\ntion to delivery. Finally, FOAF deÔ¨Ånes people, groups\nand organisations. The Music Ontology does not cover\nevery music related concept, rather, it provides exten-\nsion points where a domain speciÔ¨Åc ontology, such as\na musical instrument or a genre ontology may be inte-\ngrated.\nBased on the Musicbrainz10instrument tree, Her-\nman11published a musical instrument taxonomy ex-\npressed in SKOS. This serves as an extension to the Mu-\nsic Ontology. While SKOS is well suited for hierarchi-\ncal classiÔ¨Åcation schemes, it provides limited support\nfor other types of relationships; skos:related for\nexample, may be used to describe associative relations,\nbut only in a semi-formal way, without a more explicit\ndeÔ¨Ånition. Moreover, the transitivity of broader and nar-\nrower relations are not guaranteed in SKOS, therefore it\nis difÔ¨Åcult to infer for instance the instrument family of\na given instrument, without additional knowledge not\nexpressed in the model. While this taxonomy is suit-\nable for applications that require only a semantic label\nto represent instruments associated with audio items, it\nis insufÔ¨Åcient if the heterogeneity of instrument rela-\ntions has to be explicitly represented.\nThe Kanzaki Music Ontology12also contains a small\ninstrument taxonomy. However, there are only 5 instru-\n5http://musicontology.com/\n6http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/timeline.owl/\n7http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl/\n8http://vocab.org/frbr/core/\n9http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/\n10http://musicbrainz.org/\n11http://purl.org/ontology/mo/mit#\n12http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/music\n46612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nment families deÔ¨Åned (e.g. string instruments, wood-\nwind instruments, brass instruments, percussion, and\nkeyboard instruments), with 26 corresponding instru-\nment classes. Although these works provide instrument\ntaxonomies that can be used on the Semantic Web, there\nremains a need for a semantically rich ontology, which\nrepresents the heterogeneity as well as different compo-\nnents and aspects of musical instruments on the Web.\nFinally, a recently published XML-based taxonomy\nserves as an extension to Music XML13. This system\ndeparts form Hornobostel and Sachs, and proposes a\nclassiÔ¨Åcation scheme based on materials and performance\nmechanism, instead of the sound production mechanism.\nHowever, it remains at a hierarchical design. Further-\nmore, XML in itself is insufÔ¨Åcient for rich knowledge\nrepresentations, therefore it is hard to see how this model\nmay be extended to account for the heterogeneity and\nthe diverse set of properties of musical instruments, and\nenable logical reasoning or answering complex queries.\n4. ISSUES IN MUSICAL INSTRUMENT\nONTOLOGY DESIGN\nConceptualising a domain is inherent in developing knowl-\nedge based systems. In the Ô¨Åelds of ethno-musicology\nand Music Information Retrieval (MIR), most concep-\ntualisations of the domain of musical instruments are\nbased on the taxonomical H-S system, and very few\nstudies departed from this system. Taxonomies allow\nus to organise data in a hierarchical structure very efÔ¨Å-\nciently. However, taxonomies encode a strict relation-\nship between a parent node and a child node by us-\ningsub-class orpart-of axioms, without deÔ¨Åning the\ndetailed relationships among instrument objects, there-\nfore they are semantically weak structures for express-\ning knowledge [3, 6, 7]. Musical instruments however\nhave a multi-relational model, thereby instruments can\nbelong to more than one instrumental family or sub-\nfamily. In order to illustrate the heterogeneity and taxo-\nnomic design problems occurring in current knowledge\nrepresentations of instruments, two different instrument\nclassiÔ¨Åcation systems were taken into account: i)one\nproposed by Henry Doktorski14which will be denoted\ntaxonomy ‚ÄòA‚Äô, and ii)one proposed by Jeremy Montagu\n& John Burton [11] which will be denoted taxonomy\n‚ÄòB‚Äô. We implemented both of the taxonomies in OWL,\nand they can be found at corresponding URL15. Figure\n1 illustrates an example from the ontology design of the\nchordophones/string instrument family based on Henry\nDoktorski‚Äôs taxonomy.\n13http://www.recordare.com/musicxml/\n14http://free-reed.net/description/taxonomy\n15http://isophonics.net/content/\nmusical-instrument-taxonomies\nFigure 1 . An example from musical instrument ontol-\nogy design of chordophone/string instruments based on\nHenry Doktorski‚Äôs instrument classiÔ¨Åcation system\nAs shown in Figure 1, the violin and cello are classi-\nÔ¨Åed as bowed instruments, the guitar and banjo are clas-\nsiÔ¨Åed as plucked instruments, and the piano is classiÔ¨Åed\nas a struck instrument. However, violinist can vary their\nplaying technique depending on the expressive inten-\ntions: the strings can be excited by drawing the hair of\nthe bow across them (arco), or by plucking them (pizzi-\ncato). For these reasons, the violin should be classi-\nÔ¨Åed as either a bowed or plucked instrument. In Fig-\nures 1 and 2, the concepts that occurred multiple times\nin various instrument families, are shown using dashed\nlined shapes ( e.g. struck, plucked and rubbed). We can\ndemonstrate similar examples in the family of percus-\nsion instruments. For instance, in Figure 2, the tam-\nbourine is classiÔ¨Åed as a membranophone, whereas if it\nis only shaken, it jingles, and therefore it could be clas-\nsiÔ¨Åed as an idiophone as well. Many examples may be\nobserver related to taxonomic classiÔ¨Åcation problems,\nnot only in the ethno-musicology, but also in other ap-\nplications that rely on musical instrument knowledge\nrepresentation or information management.\nIn taxonomy B, the use of classiÔ¨Åcations such as,\nspecies ,genus ,family ,sub-order ,order , based on the\ntaxonomical system of Carl Linnaeus known as the fa-\nther of modern taxonomy. However, this study only pro-\nvides a terminological departure from the H-S system,\nsince it is still based on the same taxonomy structure. A\npartial instrument ontology design of this classiÔ¨Åcation\nscheme is depicted in Figure 3.\nThe use of different words to refer to similar con-\ncepts, or different conceptualisations, induce termino-\nlogical or conceptual heterogeneities among ontologies,\nthat can be observed from the given graphical illustra-\ntions so far. For instance, in Figure 3, the idiophones\nand the membranophones are deÔ¨Åned as a major instru-\n467Poster Session 3\nFigure 2 . An example from musical instrument ontol-\nogy design of percussion instruments based on Henry\nDoktorski‚Äôs instrument classiÔ¨Åcation system\nment family according to taxonomy B, whereas both of\nthese classes can be seen as sub-classes of the percus-\nsion instruments in taxonomy A (Figure 2).\nThe heterogeneity among these classes continues down-\nward towards to the sub-class nodes: For instance, id-\niophones are divided into unpitched and pitched sub-\ncategories, while membranophones are divided into de-\nterminate pitch and indeterminate pitch sub-categories\n(Figure 2). On the other hand, the idiophones have sub-\nclasses such as struck, shaken, striligilated and plucked\nsub-classes, while membranophones have kettle, single\nhead and double head sub-classes (Figure 3). Some con-\ncepts are present in the same taxonomic level without\ndeÔ¨Åning the relationship among concepts, and the con-\ncepts are classiÔ¨Åed according to sound initiation type\n(e.g. struck, plucked, or shaken), whereas others are\nclassiÔ¨Åed according to the instrument construction type\n(e.g. single head, double head, harps, lyres and lutes).\nTherefore, the taxonomic classiÔ¨Åcations applied tradi-\ntionally are not only heterogeneous in structure, but also\nprovide an arbitrarily problematic solution to instrument\nclassiÔ¨Åcation, because of the inadequately deÔ¨Åned knowl-\nedge representation.\n5. QUERY DRIVEN EVALUATION\nBoth taxonomies described in the previous section were\nimplemented in OWL and tested using SPARQL queries\ninvolving instruments present in both systems. In the\nfollowing examples, we query the ontology structure, as\nwell as RDF data corresponding to speciÔ¨Åc statementsabout instruments. Since in most knowledge-based en-\nvironments, data and ontology can be represented in the\nsame graph, these queries also demonstrate real-world\nuse cases for instrument knowledge representation. The\nÔ¨Årst example is based on the tuba, which is available in\nboth taxonomies. The following paragraph taken from\n[12] provides a description of the tuba:\nThe tuba is the lowest pitched Aerophone . Sound is pro-\nduced by vibrating or buzzing the lips into a large cupped mouth-\npiece, which is coupled to a coiled tube about 18 feet in length\nwith a slow rate of conical Ô¨Çare terminating in a large bell-\nshaped mouth. The tuba is usually equipped with three valves ,\neach of which adds a different length of tubing. With piston\nvalves it is possible to change the length of the air column.\nIdentifying an instrument by its sound can be a difÔ¨Å-\ncult task, even for someone with a decent musical back-\nground. For this reason, visual cues can be just as im-\nportant as hearing in instrument identiÔ¨Åcation. For ex-\nample, recognising the characteristic shape of an instru-\nment is important, since it has a profound effect on the\ngenerated sound. Based on these considerations, we\nprepared the following four queries to retrieve the in-\nformation underlined in the deÔ¨Ånition of the tuba above:\nWhat is the instrument family, the characteristic shape,\nthe sound initiation type and the number of valves of the\ntuba?\nPREFIX io: <http://example.org/io/taxonomyN#>\nPREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>\nSELECT ?x WHERE { io:Tuba rdfs:subClassOf ?x }\nListing 1. Retrieving the immediate super class of the\ntuba.\nIn the Ô¨Årst query the non-determined variable ?xis\nassigned when the query engine Ô¨Ånds the super class\nof the entity named Tuba . The query result for taxon-\nomy ‚ÄòA‚Äôisio:WithValves , and for taxonomy ‚ÄòB‚Äôis\nio:ValvesBugles . This demonstrates terminolog-\nical heterogeneity immediately on the Ô¨Årst upper level.\nNote that name space preÔ¨Åxes such as io: andrdfs:\nare expanded to full URIs by the query engine. In the\nfollowing queries, they will be omitted for brevity.\nIn order to retrieve the instrument family, we can ei-\nther expand the query until we reach the correspond-\ning node as shown in listing 2, or use a program to\ndo so appropriately. This assumes knowledge about\nthe depth and organisation of the taxonomy tree, that\nis, what information is described on each level given a\nspeciÔ¨Åc branch. Given this information, a reasoning en-\ngine could infer the instrument family relation, so that\n46812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 3 . An example from musical instrument ontology design based on Jeremy Montagu & John Burton‚Äôs instrument\nclassiÔ¨Åcation system\nSELECT ?sc1 ... ?sc(N)\nWHERE { io:Tuba rdfs:subClassOf ?sc1 .\nOPTIONAL { ?sc1 rdfs:subClassOf ?sc2 } .\n.\n.\nOPTIONAL { ?sc(N-1) rdfs:subClassOf ?sc(N) } .\n}\nListing 2. Hypothetical query for Ô¨Ånding the instrument\nfamily of the tuba.\na direct query could be written. However, taxonomy\nbased knowledge organisation systems do not contain\nthis type of information, which is their main drawback\nin answering complex queries.\nIntuitively, this query graph means that there exists\nan entity Tuba that is a subclass of ?sc1 having a rela-\ntion with another entity whose name is non-determined.\nWe may recursively go on until Ô¨Ånding the entity Aero-\nphones , the super-class of the last non-determined class.\nThe query would succeed at the 4th super-class node for\nthe taxonomy ‚ÄòA‚Äô (e.g. WithValves, BrassInstrument, Pi-\npeAerophones, Aerophones ), whereas the correspond-\ning result would be obtained at the 10th node for the tax-\nonomy ‚ÄòB‚Äô (e.g. ValvedBugles, SingleBell, Valves, End-\nBlown, Metal, Conical, DoubleLipReed, Reeds, Aero-\nphones ).\nThe main problem with taxonomical representations\nis that it‚Äôs difÔ¨Åcult to answer certain queries without\na more explicit knowledge representation. Taxonomic\nsystems propagate meaning via the parent child rela-\ntionship. We could infer that the tuba is an ( is-a, or\nrdf:type ) instrument with Valves , aBrass instrument\nand an Aerophone , according to taxonomy ‚ÄòA‚Äô. The in-\nstrument family could be directly encoded using a se-\nmantically rich ontology. Although both taxonomies\nare based on the H-S system, it is easy to observe the\ndiversity among different instrument taxonomies from\nthese query results. The problem is not only the con-\nceptual heterogeneity of the instruments themselves, butalso the terminological heterogeneity among different\nknowledge representation schemes.\n@prefix io: <http://example.org/io/taxonomyN#>\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix mo: <http://purl.org/ontology/owl/> .\n@prefix ex: <http://example.com/> .\nex:guy_klucevsek\na mo:MusicArtist ;\nfoaf:name \"Guy Klucevsek\" ;\nowl:sameAs <http://dbpedia.org/page/Guy_Klucevsek> ;\nex:guy_klucevseks_accordion\na io:Accordion .\nex:ellltl\na mo:Composition ;\ndc:title \"Eleven Large Lobsters Loose in the Lobby\"ÀÜÀÜxsd:string ;\nmo:composer ex:guy_klucevsek ;\nmo:produced_work ex:w_ellltl;\nowl:sameAs\n<http://dbtune.org/musicbrainz/page/track/8093f69e-194f-4cb1-8943-2d11fac6dcc6> .\nex:p_ellltl\na mo:Performance ;\nrdfs:label \"A performance of the composition.\"ÀÜÀÜxsd:string ;\nmo:performer ex:guy_klucevsek ;\nmo:performance_of ex:w_ellltl ;\nmo:instrument ex:guy_klucevseks_accordion .\nListing 3. RDF Data based on Music Ontology and Mu-\nsic Instrument Taxonomy (Herny Doktorski).\nThe second query is ‚ÄôWhat is the characteristic shape\nof the tuba?‚Äô . To Ô¨Ånd this information, an upward recur-\nsive query, such as the one in Listing 2, or downward\nrecursive query, which starts from the Conical concept,\ncan be used to verify that the tuba is a conical instru-\nment. However, both types of queries rely on external\nknowledge that can not be inferred from the pure taxo-\nnomical relationships directly. While taxonomy ‚ÄôB‚Äôat\nleast contains the information about the characteristic\nshape of the tuba, being Conical , taxonomy ‚ÄôA‚Äôdoes not\ncontain this information. In the third and fourth ques-\ntions, we ask ‚ÄôWhat is the sound initiation type of the\n469Poster Session 3\ntuba ?‚Äô and‚ÄôHow many valves the tuba has?‚Äô . Unfor-\ntunately none of the implemented systems encode these\nrelationships, therefore it is not possible to write queries\nto answer these questions that would produce any re-\nsults.\nIn our second example shown in listing 3, we use\nthe Music Ontology to represent the Composition and\nPerformance events from the sentence below, assuming\nthe composer also performed the piece:\nThe American accordionist and composer Guy Klucevsek\nhas written a piece for solo accordion, ‚ÄôEleven Large Lob-\nsters Loose In The Lobby‚Äô, which does not use the reeds of\nthe accordion. The performer produces sounds by clicking\nthe register switches, tapping the keys, and other percussive\nmeans. In this piece the accordion is used as an idiophone\nand not as a free-reed .\nThis example presents a case for knowledge discov-\nery using instrument taxonomies. As shown in the ex-\nample, lacking a more detailed ontological representa-\ntion, we could not describe the accordion further to take\ninto account the speciÔ¨Åc playing style. Since none of the\ntaxonomies may be used to encode information about\npossible alternative sound initiation types, we may only\nobtain the instrument‚Äôs default characteristics given a\ntaxonomy, using recursive queries such as query 2. Given\nthis representation a reasoner can only infer that the\nAccordion is a Hand blown, Free-reed, Aerophone in-\nstrument. However, in this particular example, the in-\nstrument was played using different techniques, such\nas clicking the register switches and tapping the keys,\nwhich implies its use as an idiophone. The inductive\nchallenge is to infer statements about the relations and\nobjects that are true but unobserved. Due to the draw-\nbacks of traditional taxonomies, the reasoner would not\nbe able to discover new knowledge about the particular\nindividual played as an idiophone in this speciÔ¨Åc exam-\nple.\n6. CONCLUSION\nIn this study, we investigated some issues arising in the\nrepresentation of knowledge about musical instruments.\nIn order to demonstrate their drawbacks in complex query\nanswering, we implemented two instrument taxonomies\nbased on the well-known H-S system in OWL. We found\nthat many instrument classiÔ¨Åcation schemes exhibit in-\nsufÔ¨Åcient or ill-deÔ¨Åned semantics for our purposes, thus\na more Ô¨Çexible representation is required. We demon-\nstrated using different SPARQL queries that depend-\ning on the terminology and conceptualisation used by\n(ethno)musicologists, we obtain different results for the\nsame instrument object. It also became evident, that\nontologies that deÔ¨Åne relationships between entities are\nbetter than traditional taxonomies at providing mean-ingful answers to queries.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the last ten years there has been a growing interest in\nmusic information retrieval (MIR). A variety of techniques\nfor automatically analyzing music based on both symbolic\nand audio representations have been developed. In most\ncases the target user of MIR systems has been the average\nmusic listener rather than the specialist. There is an even\nlonger tradition of computational musicology dating back\nto the 1950s of using mathematics, statistics and eventually\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.computers to study music. Most of this work in compu-\ntational musicology has focused on the symbolic domain\nand western music notation. More recently the idea of\nComputational Ethnomusicology in which MIR techniques\nare used to support research in musics from around the\nworld has been proposed [9]. Audio analysis techniques can\nbe used for empirical research on Ô¨Åeld recordings for which\nno transcription is available or feasible.\nThe study of religious chant is of particular interest to\nmusicologists as it can help understand the transition from\noral transmission to codiÔ¨Åed notation. Jewish Torah trope\nis ‚Äúread‚Äù using the thirty cantillation signs of the te‚Äôamei\nhamikra , developed by the Masoretic School between the\nsixth to the tenth centuries. The Masoretes concurrently\ninscribed the te‚Äôamim along with the vowels of the Hebrew\nletters in order to ensure accuracy in future Torah reading,\nthereby altering the previous mode of oral transmission. The\nmelodic formulae of Torah trope govern syntax, pronun-\nciation and meaning and their clearly identiÔ¨Åable melodic\ndesign, determined by their larger musical environment,\nis produced in a cultural realm that combines melodic\nimprovisation with Ô¨Åxed melodic reproduction within a\nstatic system of notation.\nThete‚Äôamim consist of thirty graphic signs. Each sign,\nplaced above or below the text, acts as a ‚Äúmelodic idea,‚Äù\nwhich either melodically connects or divides words in\norder to make the text understandable by clarifying syntax,\npronounciation and, in some cases, musical meaning. The\nsigns serve to indicate the melodic contour of a given\nmelody. Although the thirty signs of the te‚Äôamim are\nemployed in a consistent manner throughout the Hebrew\nBible, their interpretation is Ô¨Çexible: each sign‚Äôs modal\nstructure and melodic gesture is determined by the text\nportion, the liturgy, by regional traditions as well as by\nimprovisatory elements incorporated by a given ‚Äúreader‚Äù.\nIn the liturgical performance, the ba‚Äôal koreh (‚Äòthe owner\nof reading‚Äô) embellishes the text with a melodic code,\nproviding the framework to decode the textual syntax of\nthe read Torah text by the reading religious community,\nfor whom text, and not melody, is primary. Since their\ninscription, the primary functionality of the te‚Äôamim , to\n163Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\nstructure pronunciation and syntax, remained intact. But\nas the Jewish people were dispersed throughout the world,\nsecondary levels of musical code were incorporated into the\nte‚Äôamim . Borrowed melodies and modal structures, taken\nfrom surrounding musical cultures allowed not only for\nnew melodic interpretations but also for external semiotic\nmusical meaning to permeate the musical interpretation of\nthe text. As an example, the left part of Figure 1 shows the\nsign for the etnachta and the right part shows the melodic\ncontour of the performance of an etnachta .\n◊ò÷ë÷π◊ï◊ë\nFigure 1 . The notational sign of the etnachta (indicated by\nthe arrow), and the melodic contour of an etnachta .\nChant scholars have investigated historical and phe-\nnomenological aspects of melodic formulas within Jewish\nTorah trope in order to discover how improvised melodies\nmight have developed to become stable melodic entities in\ngiven Jewish communities. In this paper we investigate how\ncomputational approaches can be used to support research\nin this area. More speciÔ¨Åc, audio analysis is combined\nwith content-based similarity retrieval to explore the ways\nin which melodic contour deÔ¨Ånes melodic identities. In\nparticular the question of melodic stability is investigated.\nObserving certain key te‚Äôamim such as etnachta andtipha\nwe investigate aspects of self-similarity within Torah trope\nwithin and across various Jewish communities (based on\nrecordings of Hungarian and Moroccan Torah trope). This\nmight give us a better sense of the role of melodic gesture\nin melodic formulae in Jewish Torah trope practice and\npossibly a new understanding of the relationship between\nimprovisation and notation-based chant in and amongst\nthese divergent traditions.\nIt is also possible that some of the te‚Äôamim have pre-\ncursors to music (for instance basic syntactical divisions,\nexclamations and sentence cadence structures). The ac-\ntual performance of the te‚Äôamim also points to musical\naspects that, as scholars have pointed out, were coming\nfrom musical cultures outside of Judaism (see e.g., [2]).\nThat which has been historically studied, the relationship\nbetween Ashkenazi Torah trope and Christian plainchant,\ncan now be tested in terms of musical data analysis. By\nmeasuring the Ô¨Çexibility and variability of the te‚Äôamim we\ncan show how Ô¨Åxed musical structures and improvisation\nwithin these traditions co-exist.2. RELATED WORK\nAlthough most of existing work in music information re-\ntrieval has focused on either classical music or modern pop-\nular music, in recent years there has been a growing interest\nin applying MIR techniques to other music traditions. The\nterm Computational Ethnomusicology [9] has been used\nto describe such work. There are both challenges and\nopportunities in applying MIR techniques to ethnic music\n[5]. Some representative examples include: classiÔ¨Åcation of\nraag using pitch class distributions [4], comparative analysis\nof western and non-western traditions using automatic tonal\nfeature extraction [8], rhtyhmic similarity applied to greek\nand african traditional music [10], and singer identiÔ¨Åcation\nin rembetiko music [1].\nThe goal of this project is develop tools to study Torah\ncantillation [14]. Of particular intest is the inÔ¨Çuence of\noutside music cultures such as christian plainchant to the\nperformance of Jewish Torah trope [2]. The primary method\nthat has been used in the past to study chant recodings\nhas been listening and manual annotation. We believe\nthat the combination of automatic analysis with web-based\ninteractive visualizations can open new possibilities in em-\npirical musicological analysis of chant recordings. In the\ndevelopment of both our techniques and web-based in-\nterface we have followed an iterative participatory design\nprocess where the domain expert (one of the authors) has\nbeen regularly providing feedback and suggestions. Our\napproach is based on ideas from the Ô¨Åeld of query-by-\nhumming (QBH) [6, 7] adapted to the particular charac-\nteristics and constraints of our domain. In previous work\n[12] we compared various representations and methods of\nquantizing pitch contours in various chant traditions using\na similarity retrieval paradigm. In this paper we focus\non Jewish Torah trope, propose an alternative alignment\nmethod and show how the developed techniques can be\nused to inform musicological inquiries. To the best of our\nknoweldge a data-rich approach to the study of Torah trope\nas presented in this paper has not been attempted before.\n3. DATA ANALYSIS\nFor this small-scale study, we use the recordings of two\nreadings of the same Torah passage, one from the Hungarian\n(Ashkenazi) tradition1and the one from the Moroccan\n(Sephardic) tradition. The two recordings used in this study\ncan be consulted at: http://cantillion.sness.\nnet/ismir2011 . Both recordings have manually been\nsegmented into the individual te‚Äôamim by the author who is\na domain expert. Even though we considered the possibility\n1Recordings used with permission of the Feher Music Center in Tel\nAviv, Israel. Although this version was catalogued as being an example\nof Hungarian cantillation, the trope melody and pronunciation correspond\nmore to Italian practices of Torah trope.\n16412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nof creating an automatic segmentation tool, it was decided\nthat the task was too subjective and critical to automate.\nEach segment is annotated with a word/symbol that is re-\nlated to the corresponding cantillation sign. Each recording\ncontains approximately 130 realizations of each ta‚Äôam with\na total of 12 unique te‚Äôamim .\n3.1 Pitch Contour Representation\nEach recording has been converted to a sequence of fre-\nquency values using the SWIPEP fundamental frequency\nestimator [3] by estimating the fundamental frequency in\nnon-overlapping time-windows of 10ms. The frequency\nsequences have been converted to sequences of real-valued\nMIDI pitches with a precision of 1 cent (which is 1/100 of\nan equally tempered semitone, corresponding to a frequency\ndifference of about 0.06%). By allowing real-valued pitches\nwe have a one-to-one correspondence to the frequencies,\nand a linear scale in the pitch domain. For each of the\nrecordings, we derive a melodic scale by detecting the peaks\nin a non-parametric density estimation of the distribution of\npitches, using a Gaussian kernel. This can be viewed as\na smoothed frequency histogram. Prominent peaks in the\nhistogram correspond to salient pitches and can be used to\nform a discrete pitch scale that is speciÔ¨Åc to the recording\nrather than any particular tuning system.\nIn a previous study [12], mean average precision values\nwere computed for each of the scales containing 1 to 13\npitches, taking all realizations of the same ta‚Äôam as the\nquery segment as relevant items, and using a distance\nmeasure based on dynamic time warping. The Ô¨Ånding was\nthat quantizing the melodic contours according to the scale\ncontaining twopitches resulted in the highest mean average\nprecision. Apparently, the two most prevalent pitches have\nstructural meaning.\nIn the current study we use a different approach. Instead\nof quantizing the melodic contours, we scale them linearly\naccording to the two most prevalent pitches in the entire\nrecording. We denote the higher and lower of the two\nprevalent pitches as phigh andplow, respectively. Each pitch\nis scaled relative to plowin units of the difference between\nphigh andplow. Thus, scaled pitches with value <0are\nbelow the lowest of the two prevalent pitches and pitches\nwith value>1are above the highest of the two and pitches\nbetween 0 and 1 are between the two prevalent pitches.\nAs a result, different trope performances, sung at different\nabsolute pitch heights, are comparable.\n3.2 A distance measure for melodic segments\nOn the acquired scaled pitch contours we apply an align-\nment algorithm as described in [13], interpreting the align-\nment score as similarity measure. This approach is closely\nrelated to the use of dynamic time warping in [12], butthe current approach uses a more advanced, musicologically\ninformed, scoring function for the individual elements of the\npitch sequences.\nWe use the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algo-\nrithm [11]. This algorithm Ô¨Ånds an optimal alignment of\ntwo sequences of symbols, which, in our case, are sequences\nof pitches. The quality of an alignment is measured by the\nalignment score, which is the sum of the alignment scores\nof the individual symbols. If we consider two sequences of\nsymbols x:x1,...,x i,...,x n, andy:y1,...,y j,...,y m,\nthen symbol xican either be aligned with a symbol from\nsequence yor with a gap. Both operations have a score,\nrespectively the substitution score and the gap score. The\ngap score is mostly expressed as penalty, i.e. a negative\nscore. The optimal alignment and its score are found by\nÔ¨Ålling a matrix Drecursively according to:\nD(i,j) = maxÔ£±\nÔ£≤\nÔ£≥D(i‚àí1,j‚àí1) +S(xi,yj)\nD(i‚àí1,j)‚àíŒ≥\nD(i,j‚àí1)‚àíŒ≥,(1)\nin whichS(xi,yj)is a similarity measure for symbols,\nŒ≥is the gap penalty, D(0,0) = 0 ,D(i,0) =‚àíiŒ≥,\nandD(0,j) =‚àíjŒ≥.D(i,j)contains the score of the\noptimal alignment up to xiandyjand therefore, D(m,n)\ncontains the score of the optimal alignment of the complete\nsequences. We can obtain the alignment itself by tracing\nback fromD(m,n)toD(0,0); the standard dynamic pro-\ngramming algorithm has both time and space complexity\nO(nm).\nThe similarity measure for symbols, which returns values\nin the interval [‚àí1,1], is in our case deÔ¨Åned as:\nS(x,y) =/braceleftbigg1‚àí4|spx‚àíspy|if|spx‚àíspy|‚â§0.5\n‚àí1 otherwise,\nin which scaled pitch of symbol xis\nspx=px‚àíplow,x\npheigh,x‚àíplow,x,\nin whichpxis the pitch of symbol x, represented in\ncontinuous midi encoding, and plow,x andphigh,x are the\nlowest and highest pitch in the entire recording to which\nsymbolxbelongs.spyis computed in the same way. We\nuse a linear gap penalty function with Œ≥= 0.6.\nSince the score of an alignment depends on the length of\nthe sequences, normalization is needed to compare different\nalignment scores. The alignment of two long sequences\nresults in a much higher score than the alignment of two\nshort sequences. Therefore, we divide the alignment score\nby the length of the shortest sequence. Thus, an exact\nmatch results in score 1, which is the maximal score. The\nscores are converted into distances by taking one minus the\nnormalized score, resulting in distances greater than or equal\nto zero.\n165Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\nFigure 2 . Web-based visualization interface which allows users to listen to audio, see pitch contour visualization of different\nsigns, and to enable interactive similarity-based querying.\n4. USER INTERFACE\nWe have developed a browsing interface that allows re-\nsearchers to organize and analyze chant segments in a\nvariety of ways. Each recording is manually segmented\ninto te‚Äôamim . The pitch contours of these segments can\nbe viewed at different levels of detail. They can also\nbe rearranged in a variety of ways both manually and\nautomatically.\nThe interface shown in Figure 2 has four main sections: a\nsound player, a main window to display the audio segments,\na control window, and a histogram window. The sound\nplayer window displays a spectrogram representation of\nthe sound Ô¨Åle with shuttle controls to let the user choose\nthe current playback position in the sound Ô¨Åle. The main\nwindow shows all the segments of the recording as icons\nthat can be repositioned automatically based on a variety of\nsorting criteria, or alternatively can be manually positioned\nby the user. The name of each segment (from the initial\nsegmentation step) appears above its F0 contour. The shuttle\ncontrol of the main sound player is linked to the shuttle\ncontrols in each of these icons, allowing the user to set the\ncurrent playback state either way.\nWhen an icon in the main F0 display window is clicked,\nthe histogram window shows a histogram of the distribution\nof quantized pitches in the selected segment. Below this\nhistogram is a slider to choose how many of the largest\nhistogram bins will be used to generate a simpliÔ¨Åed contour\nrepresentation of the F0 curve. In the limiting case of\nselecting all histogram bins, the reduced curve is exactly the\nquantized F0 curve. At lower values, only the histogrambins with the most items are used to draw the reduced\ncurve, which has the effect of reducing the impact of outliers\nand providing a smoother ‚Äúabstract‚Äù contour. Shift-clicking\nselects multiple segments; in this case the histogram win-\ndow includes the data from all the selected segments. We\noften select all segments with the same word or ta‚Äôam ; this\ncauses the simpliÔ¨Åed contour representation to be calculated\nusing the sum of all the pitches found in that particular\nta‚Äôam , enhancing the quality of the simpliÔ¨Åed contour\nrepresentation. Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the browsing\ninterface. We have implemented a mode that allows the\nresearcher to sort the segments based on the alignment score\nfrom one segment to the other. The interface allows the user\nto select an arbitrary segment from the interface, and then\nperform a sorting of all other segments to it. In the example\nshown in Figure 2, the user has chosen a revia , and has\nsorted all the other segments based on their alignment-based\ndistance from this Ô¨Årst revia . One can see that the segment\nclosest to this revia is another revia from a different section\nof the audio Ô¨Åle.\n5. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION\nTo investigate the stability in performance of the various\nte‚Äôamim , we use two approaches. Firstly, we compute the\nmean average precision for each of the te‚Äôamim based on the\nalignment-distance. Each segment is taken as query and all\nrenditions of the same ta‚Äôam are taken as relevant items. The\nhigher the mean average precision, the higher the relevant\nitems are on the ranked lists that are obtained by sorting all\nsegments according to the distance to the query segment.\n16612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTa‚Äôam Average Ta‚Äôam Average\n(Morocco) Precision (Hungary) Precision\n(Morocco) (Hungary)\nsofpasuq 0.550 sofpasuq 0.994\nkaton 0.399 revia 0.967\ntipha 0.306 etnachta 0.945\nmapah 0.299 pashta 0.683\npashta 0.269 tipha 0.673\nrevia 0.245 katon 0.562\netnachta 0.234 mapah 0.550\nzakef 0.206 merha 0.530\nmerha 0.158 zakef 0.231\nmunach 0.147 munach 0.179\nkadma 0.036 kadma 0.040\nTable 1 .

Figure 3 shows the distribution of alignment-\nbased distances between unrelated segments. This his-\ntogram can be used as reference for comparing distances\nbetween related segments. The interface, as described in the\nprevious section, is used to examine the relations between\nindividual audio segments.\n 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n 0 0.5  1 1.5  2 2.5  3 3.5  4Count\nDistance\nFigure 3 .

Since we do not know a-\npriori whether every ta‚Äôam has a high level of distinction, we\ncannot draw conclusions about the quality of our distance\nmeasure from the MAP-values.

Observing the renditions\nofsof pasuq and tipha in the Hungarian tradition, one\ncan derive that they inhibit a deÔ¨Ånite melodic stability.\nFor the sof pasuq we obtain a mean average precision as\nhigh as 0.994 and for the tipha 0.673 (for comparison, the\nÔ¨Ågures for the Moroccan performance are 0.550 and 0.306\nrespectively). This indicates that the 17 sof pasuqs are both\nsimilar to each other and distinct from all other te‚Äôamim .\nThe same applies to a somewhat lesser extent to the 24\ntiphas . These Ô¨Åndings are conÔ¨Årmed by the distributions\nof distances as shown in Figures 4 and 5.\n 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n 0 0.5  1 1.5  2 2.5  3 3.5  4Count\nDistance\n 0 1 2 3 4 5\n 0 0.5  1 1.5  2 2.5  3 3.5  4Count\nDistance\nFigure 6 .

Such a melodic stability might\nhave been due to the inÔ¨Çuence of Christian Chant on\nJewish communities in Europe, as is the thesis of Avenary\n[2]. Simultaneously, our approach using two structurally\nimportant pitches also corresponds to the possible inÔ¨Çuence\nof recitation and Ô¨Ånal tone as being primary tonal indicators\nwithin Askenazi chant practice (which the Hungarian Torah\nTrope is part of), thereby allowing for a greater melodic\nstability per trope sign than in Sephardic chant.\nThe Ô¨Åndings are interesting when observed in connection\nwith musicological and music historical studies of Torah\ntrope. It has long been known that the variety of melodic\nformulae in Ashkenazi trope exceeded that of Sephardic\ntrope renditions. The te‚Äôamim actually entail more symbols\nthan necessary for syntactical divisions. That being said, in\ncertain te‚Äôamim , like in the version of etnachta , a greater\namount of melodic variability is presented. This is not\nmirrored in the example of tipha , which serves to combine\nwords to make a clear syntactical unit. In both Hungarian\nand Moroccan variants this ta‚Äôam shows a greater degree\nof stability. This shows that certain conjunctive te‚Äôamim ,\nwhich show greater melodic stability, might also act as more\nstable syntactical anchors in both traditions. One might\ninvestigate if this is also true in other traditions (Iranian,\nYemenite and Lithuanian).\n6. FUTURE WORK\nIn the current study, we took the two most prevalent pitches\nfor scaling. There are reasons to assume that for various\nperformance traditions different numbers of pitches are of\nstructural importance. We will investigate this in future\nresearch. The presented method proves useful for the two\nrecordings under investigation. In a next stage, we will\ncollect much more data, with the aim to study stability\nand variation between and within performance traditions\nof Torah trope on a large scale, integrating the results into\nongoing musicological and historical research on this topic.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nIn this paper we study how to search for excerpts of music in\na large database resembling a given query pattern. We allow\nboth the query pattern and the database to be polyphonic.\nTypically the query pattern constitutes a subset of instru-\nments appearing in the database while the database may\nrepresent a full orchestration of a musical piece. The gen-\neral setting requires methods based on symbolic representa-\ntion capable of dealing with true polyphonic subset match-\ning; audio-based methods are only applicable to rudimen-\ntary cases where queries are directed to clearly separable\nmelodies.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Except for some trivial cases, the straightforward CBMR\napproach of linear string representation combined with a\nstring matching algorithm does not properly capture the poly-\nphonic CBMR problem. Recently, a more appropriate, geo-\nmetric modeling of music has been succesfully used by sev-\neral authors [5‚Äì7]. This approach models polyphonic music\nvery naturally, but usually also takes into account another\nimportant feature intrinsic to the problem: the matching pro-\ncess ignores extra intervening notes in the database that do\nnot appear in the query. Extra notes may occur because of\ndifferent polyphonic arrangements, musical decorations and\nunexpected noise. Recent geometric methods [2, 3, 6] have\nchallenged different timing problems. In the Ô¨Årst setting,\nthe occurrences may be tranposed and time-scaled copies\nof the query [2, 6]. Under the transposition and time-scale\ninvariance (theTTSI setting), however, the queries need to\nbe given exactly in tempo. In a realistic application local\ntime jittering occur in every note-onset in the query, and a\nstronger, transposition and time-warp invariance is required\nfor a successful matching (the TTWI setting). The latter is\nthe setting for our algorithms to be introduced. The Ô¨Årst\nsolutions for the TTWI setting was recently presented by\nLemstr ¬®om and Laitinen [3].\nOur algorithms are based on the pitch-against-time rep-\nresentation of note-on information (see Fig 1). The musical\npieces in a database are concatenated in a single geometri-\ncally represented Ô¨Åle, denoted by T;T=t0,t1,...,tn‚àí1,\nwhere each element tj‚ààR2for0‚â§j‚â§n‚àí1and the el-\nements are sorted in the lexicographic order. Any symbolic\nmusic Ô¨Åle is convertible in this representation. Later it may\nbe possible to convert audio Ô¨Åles and sheet music by using\naudio transcription and optical music recognition. Although\nboth processes are error prone, it may be the case that the\nresulting representations are usable due to the robustness\nof our algorithms against noise. In a typical retrieval case\nthe query pattern P,P=p0,p1,...,pm‚àí1;pi‚ààR2for\n0‚â§i‚â§m‚àí1, to be searched for is monophonic and much\nshorter than the polyphonic database Tto be searched; our\nalgorithms, however, deal equally well with monophonic\nand polyphonic input.

Nevertheless, there is an online approxi-\nmation algorithm for it running in time O(nlogn)[1].\nIn [6], Romming and Selfridge-Field gave a geometric-\nhashing based algorithm for S2 working in time O(wnm3)\nand spaceO(w2n). Lemstr ¬®om [2] generalized algorithms\nP1 and P2 to the time-scaled problems S1 and S2. The\nalgorithms work in O(mŒ£ log Œ£) time andO(mŒ£)space,\nwhere Œ£ =O(wn)when searching for exact occurrences\nandŒ£ =O(nw2)when searching for partial occurrences.\nThe Ô¨Årst algorithms for W1 and W2 were introduced only\nvery recently in [3]. The sweepline-based algorithms are\nfurther generalizations of those above. In this TTWI case\nthe windowing takes an invaluable role; the number of false\npositives would grow uncontrollably without it. The asymp-\ntotic time and space complexities, however, remain the same\nas with the solution for S1 and S2.\nIn this paper we introduce new algorithms for the TTWI\nsetting. Our algorithms are based on dynamic program-\nming and their asymptotic worst case complexities are lower\nthan those of the earlier rivals: for the case W1 we have\nanO(mnw )algorithm; for the W2 case our algorithm runs\nin timeO(mnw2). In our experiments, however, in usual\nquery settings the sweepline-based algorithms often outper-\nform our dynamic programming algorithms. The main con-\ntribution of the new algorithms is in their simplicity which\nmakes them easy-to-understand and easy-to-implement. In\naddition to this elegance, in the worst-case scenario our new\nalgorithms clearly outperforms the sweepline-based algo-\nrithms.\nIt is also theoretically very interesting to discover that dy-\nnamic programming is applicable in the TTWI setting. Ap-\nplying dynamic progamming for the more straightforward\nproblems, including the TTSI setting, has thus far proven to\nbe too challenging.\n37012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nDPW2(P,T,w )\n1M=A four-dimensional array, Ô¨Ålled with ‚àí1\n2fori= 0 toP.size‚àí1\n3 forj= 0 toT.size‚àí1\n4 F ILL-M(M,P,T,w,i + 1,j+ 1,1,1)\n5 R EPORT -RESULTS (M)\nFILL-M(M,P,T,w,pcur,tcur,x,y )\n1/ /Return result if it has been already calculated\n2ifM[pcur,tcur,x,y ]/negationslash=‚àí1\n3 returnM[pcur,tcur,x,y ]\n4/ /Bounds checking, base case for recursion\n5iftcur‚â•T.size orpcur‚â•P.size\n6 return 0\n7best= 0\n8/ /Do the notes under investigation match each other?\n9ifTtcur.y‚àíTtcur‚àíy.y==Ppcur.y‚àíPpcur‚àíx.y\n10 a=FILL-M(M,P,T,w,pcur + 1,tcur + 1,1,1)\n11 best=max(a+ 1,best)\n12/ /Can we still extend the search inside the window?\n13 ify<w\n14 a=FILL-M(M,P,T,w,pcur,tcur + 1,x,y + 1)\n15 best=max(a,best)\n16/ /Finally, Ô¨Ånd the matches with Ppnot included\n17a=FILL-M(M,P,T,w,pcur + 1,tcur,x + 1,y)\n18best=max(a,best)\n19M[pcur,tcur,x,y ] =best\n20 return best\nFigure 3 .

ALGORITHMS\nIn this section we describe two new algorithms to Ô¨Ånd ex-\nact and partial transposition and time-warp invariant occur-\nrences of a pattern Pfrom a given database T. To distinct\nour new algorithms from the previous sweepline algorithms\nW1 and W2 (solving problems W1 and W2), we shall re-\nfer to our dynamic programming algorithms by D PW1 and\nDPW2, respectively.\nThe new algorithms require the input to be given as a list\nof notes, where each note is represented by a pair (x,y)in\na two-dimensional coordinate system. The x-component of\nthe pair represents the note-on time, the y-component rep-\nresents the pitch of the note. We assume both PandTto\nbelexicographically sorted , i.e.aprecedesbif and only if\na.x<b.x ora.x=b.xanda.y<b.y .\nLet us next introduce some important deÔ¨Ånitions. A trans-\nlation ofPwith vectorfresults inP+f=p0+f,p 1+\nf,...,pm‚àí1+f, wherepi+f= (pi.x+f.x,pi.y+f.y).This translation captures two signiÔ¨Åcant musical phenom-\nena, asf.xaligns the excerpt time-wise, while f.ytrans-\nposes the excerpt to a lower or higher key. We also deÔ¨Åne\nmusical time-scaling with œÉ,œÉ‚ààR+. This time-scaling\nonly affects horizontal translation, i.e. scales only the time\ncomponents.\nThe following examples and deÔ¨Ånition illustrate the type\nof occurrences we aim at Ô¨Ånding with the algorithms.\nExample 2.1 Letp=/angbracketleft3,1/angbracketright,f=/angbracketleft2,5/angbracketrightandœÉ= 2. Then\np+œÉf=/angbracketleft7,6/angbracketright.\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.2 tœÑ0...tœÑm‚àí1, a subsequence of T, is a time-\nwarp occurrence of pœÄ0...pœÄm‚àí1, a subsequence of P, if\nfor eachi,0‚â§i‚â§m‚àí2, there is a time-scaling œÉi‚ààR+\nsuch thatœÉi(pœÄi+1‚àípœÄi) =tœÑi+1‚àítœÑiand0‚â§œÄj< m ,\nœÄj<œÄj+1,0‚â§œÑj<nandœÑj<œÑj+1for allj.\nLet us next illustrate the essence of the deÔ¨Ånition, where\nwe have an exact time-warping occurrence ofP.\nExample 2.3 Letp0=/angbracketleft2,7/angbracketright,p1=/angbracketleft4,8/angbracketright,p2=/angbracketleft6,8/angbracketright,p3=\n/angbracketleft9,7/angbracketrightandt0=/angbracketleft1,1/angbracketright,t1=/angbracketleft2,3/angbracketright,t2=/angbracketleft3,2/angbracketright,t3=/angbracketleft4,2/angbracketright,t4=\n/angbracketleft5,1/angbracketright. Thent0,t2,t3,t4is an exact time-warping occur-\nrence ofp0,p1,p2,p3withœÉ0= 1,œÉ1=1\n2andœÉ2=1\n3.\nHad we had t4=/angbracketleft5,0/angbracketrightin Example 2.3, then t0,t2,t3would\nhave been a partial time-warping occurrence of P, matching\np0,p1andp2.\nIn [3], Lemstr ¬®om and Laitinen deÔ¨Åned two problems:\nÔ¨Ånding exact and partial translation and time-warp invariant\noccurrences of PfromT. The exact nature of an occurrence\nis captured in deÔ¨Ånition 2.2. These problems can be de-\nscribed followingly: in the exact case, we aim to Ô¨Ånd a sub-\nsequencetœÑ0,tœÑ1,...,tœÑm‚àí1so that for each pi,i<m‚àí1,\npi+1.y‚àípi.y=tœÑi+1.y‚àítœÑi.yholds. In the partial case, we\naim to Ô¨Ånd longest subsequence from Pfor which we can\nÔ¨Ånd a matching subsequence from T, as in the deÔ¨Ånition 2.2.\nIn our setting, it is useful to apply a windowing restric-\ntion, which states that two consecutive notes in the database\nsubsequence cannot be more than wnotes away from each\nother in the database. The window size wis designed to\nlimit the number of senseless occurrences, and it is also able\nto signiÔ¨Åcantly speed up the algorithms.\nOur algorithms are recursive in nature, and are very sim-\nilar to each other. We will cover the more complex D PW2\nin depth, and pinpoint the differences to D PW1.\nIn the beginning, the aim of the algorithms is to Ô¨Åll the\nM-table by calling function F ILL-M (see Fig. 3) with ap-\npropriate base states. F ILL-M takes 8 parameters, 4 of which\nare variables: pcur,tcur,x andy. These variables deÔ¨Åne the\nstate F ILL-M is currently solving.\nFILL-M returns the length of the longest occurrence we\ncan construct from the state it was given. In the case of\n371Poster Session 3\nFigure 4 . Time resource performance comparison of W2\nand D PW2.\nDPW2, the current state is deÔ¨Åned by the four parameters.\nThe parameters deÔ¨Åne the state followingly: ppcur‚àíxis the\nlast note chosen from the pattern, ttcur‚àíyis the last note\nchosen from the database, whereas ppcur,ppcur +1,...,pm‚àí1\nandttcur,ttcur +1,...,tn‚àí1are the notes that can be se-\nlected in future from pattern and database, respectively.\nIn the case of D PW2, F ILL-M has at maximum three pos-\nsible options in any state. F ILL-M evaluates, which of the\noptions is the best one, and returns the length of the longest\noccurrence. If the note under investigation can be legally\nadded to the pattern, then the algorithm adds the note, and\nmoves on to Ô¨Ånd new ones. Also, if we have not yet reached\nthe windowing limit, then we can move on without adding\nany notes, and Ô¨Ånding a new candidate further away in the\ndatabase. Our third option, which is available in the case of\nDPW2, is skipping ppcur altogether and not including it to\nthe match at all. In the case of D PW1, we can never skip any\nppcur, since otherwise the match being constructed would\nnot be exact anymore.\nThe algorithm can legally add notes to the occurrence, if\nnote pairs (ppcur‚àíx,ppcur)and(ttcur‚àíy,ttcur)match each\nother under the translation and time-warp invariances, i.e.\nppcur.y‚àíppcur‚àíx.y=ttcur.y‚àíttcur‚àíy.y. Then we can\ncall F ILL-M recursively with a state (pn,tn,xn,yn)where\nxn=yn= 1,pn=pcur + 1 andtn=tcur + 1. This\nmeans that in the new state, the previous notes that were\npicked from pattern and database, were ppn‚àí1andttn‚àí1,\nrespectively. Naturally, in the new state, we can Ô¨Ånd new\nmatching notes from ppnandttnonwards.\nAlso, if the parameters for F ILL-M are same that have\nbeen used previously, then the algorithm can avoid calculat-\ning this state again, since every time F ILL-M is called with\nthe same parameters, it has to return the same result. There-\nfore every time we have Ô¨Ånished calculating a state, we can\nstore the result, and return the stored result whenever F ILL-\nFigure 5 . Time resource performance comparison of W2\nand D PW2. Database used represented the worst case sce-\nnario for W2.\nM is again called with the same parameters.\nThe case of D PW1 is very similar to that of D PW2. In\nDPW1, however, we cannot allow the algorithm to skip any\nnotes from the pattern, which means that xwill always be 1.\nAsxis not a variable anymore, we do not have to store it in\ntheM-table; it is initialized it to be 3-dimensional.\nAs F ILL-M requires that at least one note has been se-\nlected from both the pattern and the database, we must ini-\ntialize theM-table by calling F ILL-M with all possible com-\nbinations of Ô¨Årst notes (see Fig. 3). Once the M-table is\nÔ¨Ålled, we can construct the matches we are interested in by\ninvestigating the M-table in a similar fashion to the way\nFILL-M does. Also, if we are only interested in the length\nof the longest occurrence, we do not need to investigate M-\ntable afterwards at all, as F ILL-M itself returns the length of\nthe longest occurrence.\nThe time complexities for D PW1 and D PW2 areO(mnw )\nandO(mnw2), respectively. The number of states depends\nof the possible values of the variables. The variables can\nvary followingly: 0‚â§pcur < m ,0‚â§tcur < t ,1‚â§x‚â§\nwand1‚â§y‚â§w. In D PW1xis not a variable, so there are\nO(mnw )states, and in D PW2 we getwtimes more states,\ndue to the fact that xcan vary. Since the amount of calcula-\ntion in each state is constant, the time complexities become\nsimply the number of states in both cases.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\nWe compared the performance of W2 to that of D PW2 in\ndifferent scenarios, and also W1 against D PW1 in a typical\nscenario. In our experiments, we used music data from Mu-\ntopia database so that the pieces of music were concatenated\ntogether to form a large database. In the worst case compar-\nison databases and patterns were speciÔ¨Åcally tailored. In\n37212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 6 . Time performance comparison of W1 and D PW1.\nall tests, we kept the pattern and window sizes constant,\nm=w= 10 .\nIt was expected that in cases where the database size is\nsmall, W2 would be slightly faster than D PW2, since the\ncomplexity difference would not be able to kick in with\nsmaller database sizes, and the ability of being able to skip\nnon-compact matches would outweigh the additional loga-\nrithmic term. However, it seemed likely that D PW2 would\nbecome gradually faster with larger database sizes when com-\npared with W2.\nIn our experiments, W2 outpeformed D PW2 in the smaller\ncases, as expected. With growing database sizes, however,\nDPW2 was not able to catch up, and instead the performance\ndifference became even larger in favour of W2.\nIt seems that the fact that W2 calculates only the compact\nmatches, while D PW2 calculates exactly all matches, is re-\nsponsible for the difference. Even though theoretical time\ncomplexity suggests that W2 should eventually be slower\nwith larger databases, it seems that in a typical setting the\nability of W2 to eliminate matches grows faster than the ad-\nditional logarithmic term, as depicted in Fig. 4. This sug-\ngests that the expected complexity of W2 would be signiÔ¨Å-\ncantly smaller than its worst-case complexity.\nThe property of being able to skip non-compact matches\nis even more visible in the exact case, where D PW1 is signif-\nicantly slower than W1 in a real-world scenario (see Fig. 6).\nIt seems that the penalty for Ô¨Ånding all possible matches is\neven larger here.\nTo further experiment on the effect of getting rid of addi-\ntional matches, we constructed the absolute worst case sce-\nnario for W2, where all the notes in both the pattern and the\ndatabase have the same pitch. In this setting, W2 would not\nbe able to eliminate many matches, which results in a large\namount of additional work. In Fig. 5, we depict the time us-\nage of the two algorithms in the worst case for W2. From the\nÔ¨Ågure it is evident that W2 uses a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of time\nin this type of setting, even with very small databases. It isalso noteworthy that the time usage of W2 grows quickly.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we presented two new algorithms for the trans-\nposition and time-warp invariant ( TTWI ) content-based poly-\nphonic music retrieval setting. We used the geometric frame-\nwork where each note is represented as a point in the Eu-\nclidean plane (pitch value against on-set time). The frame-\nwork has several advantages: it is intuitive, it intrinsically\ndeals with polyphonic music, transposition invariance and\nsubset matching. The TTWI setting that allows for local\ntime jittering makes the approach usable in real-world ap-\nplications where queries are always somewhat out of tempo.\nOur D PW1 algorithm solves the exact matching problem un-\nder the TTWI setting while D PW2 is for the partial matching\nproblem under the same setting. The algorithms, based on\ndynamic programming, have better asymptotic worst-case\ntime complexities than their only existing rivals [3], here\ncalled W1 and W2, based on the sweepline techique.\nOur experiments revealed that in a typical query case W2\nis faster than D PW2. This is due to the capability of W2\nto eliminate non-compact matches while D PW2 thoroughly\nscrutinizes every possible match. The impact of the elimi-\nnation, however, was surprisingly strong given that W2 has\nan additional logarithmic term in its asymptotic complexity.\nNevertheless, when looking for consistent performance, our\nDPW2 is the choice to be taken as in complex query cases\nW2 freezes suddenly. The elegance of our new algorithms\nlie in their simplicity: they, unlike the rivaling algorithms,\nare very easy both to implement and to understand.\nAs hinted by Fig. 4, with the future very large music\ndatabases, neither W2 nor D PW2 alone would work in an\ninteractive setting. As a future work, we will study a dis-\ntributed calculation process. Even though the sweepline-\nbased solutions were somewhat faster in typical real-world\nqueries in our experiments, the distributed setting is pre-\nsumed to be signiÔ¨Åcantly different: dynamic programming\nalgorithms are generally easily distributable, while distribut-\ning sweepline-based algorithms may prove to be very chal-\nlenging.\n5.

INTRODUCTION Social psychology of music has long informed us that mu-sic practices are inherently social: the social context molds how people perceive, experience or engage with music [12]. Cultural taste and especially musical taste often serve as a mean of distinction and prestige [1]. One‚Äôs music pref-erences reflect who one is or aspire to be. Therefore, it would be difficult to predict one‚Äôs musical taste solely by analyzing the objective and intrinsic characteristics of the music one loves. This explains why people often rely on their social network to expand their music repertoire: in ad-dition to considering one‚Äôs taste when making recommen-dations, friends and relatives are able to take into account the values, attitudes and beliefs associated with the music.  This also explains why most systems that provide per-sonalized recommendations for music (e.g., Last.fm, iTunes Genius) or for other cultural items such as books (e.g., Am-azon) or movies (e.g., MovieLens), rely on social or collab-orative filtering rather than content-based filtering. What allows each of these recommender systems to distinguish itself from others is the algorithm it uses to generate the recommendations and, more specifically, the type of infor-mation the algorithm makes use of, which can include im-plicit feedback (e.g., listening habits, previous purchases) and/or explicit feedback (e.g., user ratings, lists of favorite artists). However, as Celma [2] points out, these systems also have their drawbacks, such as the so called ‚Äúcold start problem,‚Äù which applies to both new music and new users, and the difficulty these systems have to provide novel, non obvious recommendations. Possible solutions that have been proposed include the development of hybrid recom-mender systems that would combine collaborative and con-tent-based filtering [17], and the use of some characteristics of the users that are known to influence musical taste, such as demographic characteristics, socioeconomic background and personality traits [15].  Social network sites might also open new possibilities for generating music recommendations. A site like Face-book already offers several ways for members to express their music preferences, by means of implicit feedback (e.g., the sharing of links to music videos) and explicit feedback (e.g., the list of favorite music in the user‚Äôs pro-file, the ‚Äúlike‚Äù button that allows users to express interest in a music video shared by another user or in the page of a music artist). In addition to that, Facebook contains exten-sive information about one‚Äôs social network which, again, can be explicit (e.g., becoming ‚Äúfriend‚Äù with someone, in-dicating the type of kinship with another user) or implicit (e.g., the strength of a relationship can be estimated by cal-culating the number of interactions occurring between two members, the number of times they tag each others on pic-tures and/or the number of networks or friends they have in common). Considering the popularity of social networking sites and the impact of the social context on musical prac-tices, it seems relevant to explore whether relationships characteristics could be exploited to improve social filtering algorithms in music recommender systems that include so-cial networking features.  A first step in that direction is to examine the character-istics of the ties through which people discover new music in everyday life. It is with this objective in mind that this study was designed. Its aim was to study how music infor-mation circulates within the social networks of late adoles-\n Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that cop-ies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n341Oral Session 5: User Studies\n   cents (15-17 years old) and, more specifically, to examine the attributes of the ties that are instrumental (or not) for music discovery. Older adolescents are a particularly inter-esting population to study. According to a survey conduct-ed for the Pew Internet & American Life Project, it is the age group that shows the highest percentage of social net-working sites users [11]. Adolescence is also the period during which people construct their identity, and music plays a central role in that process [12]. Furthermore, late adolescence is critical in the formation of one‚Äôs taste, since it is the period during which the ‚Äúcrystallization of musical taste‚Äù generally occurs [11].   2. RELATED WORK Previous research has demonstrated that people play an important role in information provision, especially to an-swer everyday-life information needs [8, 9]. People also rely heavily on their social networks to discover new music [10, 17]. To better understand who people choose to ap-proach to get the information they need, several research-ers have adopted a social network perspective and found that weak ties (e.g., acquaintances) were usually more in-strumental than strong ties (e.g., kins and friends) to ac-quire new information [6, 9], which is at the origins of Granovetter‚Äôs ‚ÄúStrength of Weak Ties‚Äù theory [6]. Within the social network approach, the term ‚Äúsocial capital‚Äù has been used to refer to resources (e.g., information) embed-ded in a social structure [9]. Social network researchers have established that there was a clear relationship between similarity and association. People tend to interact more with people who have similar demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, social class), as well as people who share their behavior patterns, values and beliefs (e.g., political orientation) [13]. This is the principle of homophily, which posits that ‚Äúdis-tance in terms of social characteristics translates into net-work distance, the number of relationships through which a piece of information must travel to connect two individu-als‚Äù [13]. In other words, homophilous ties are more likely to be strong ties. Granovetter also demonstrated that the stronger the tie between two individuals, the greater the overlap in their social networks. As a result of the ho-mophilous nature of strong ties and the extent of overlap in their social networks, strong ties usually have access or are exposed to similar information. This explains why weak ties were found to be more instrumental than strong ties in the acquisition of new information: not only are they usual-ly exposed to different information, they can also act as a bridge between two groups of densely knit networks of close friends [6].  3. METHODOLOGY This study is part of a larger project examining the way music information is shared within the social network of late adolescents living in an urban area. Pretest interviews with 6 adolescents were conducted in the summer of 2010. The main study was conducted in the winter and spring of 2011 and included 19 late adolescents (15 to 17 years old). 3.1 Social Network Analysis Social network analysis (SNA) was used to study how mu-sic information is shared within the social networks of ado-lescents. SNA focuses on ‚Äúrelationships among social enti-ties, and on the patterns and implications of these relation-ships,‚Äù [16] in particular on the flow of resources (e.g., in-formation) among actors. It provides a set of methods and theoretical concepts that can be used to analyze and de-scribe the characteristics of social networks and the ties they are composed of. To perform SNA, an egocentric or personal network approach was adopted, which consists in examining social networks from the perspective of focal persons (the ‚ÄúEgos‚Äù). This approach is well suited to popu-lations that are large and difficult to delimit. It contrasts with the whole network approach, which looks at the ties that all members of a well-defined population (e.g., all members of an organization) maintain with each other. Alt-hough SNA was first developed and used by sociologists, it rapidly proved its utility in other fields of research, includ-ing information science. Its use in this domain was promot-ed by several researchers, among them Haythornthwaite who explained that ‚ÄúSince information is an important re-source, and one that often depends on making and main-taining contact with the right people, a social network ap-proach offers a rich variety of concepts and techniques to describe and explain information access‚Äù [7]. 3.2 Data Collection  Data were collected during in-depth, face-to-face individual interviews. Different instruments were used to obtain in-formation about the social network of each participant and the way music information is exchanged within the net-work. We used an adaptation of the social network mapping tool designed by Todd and described in [3], which consists of a set of seven concentric circles at the center of which is the participant (called ‚ÄúEgo‚Äù). To fill the map, participants were asked to think about how people were clustered in their life (e.g., school, family, friends from elementary school, friends from summer camp, etc.). These clusters or sectors were put on the map. To elicit the names of the per-sons to be included on their map (called ‚Äúalters‚Äù), we used three different methods. We used a name generator, which consists in asking, for each cluster identified, the names of the people to which they felt close or very close. Partici-pants were also asked to name all people through which they had discovered music in the last year or with whom they often discussed music. Finally, we used a method called critical incident technique [4], which attempts to rely on a concrete situation to generate a more accurate report of one‚Äôs behavior than a hypothetical question would. Partici-pants were therefore asked to recall how they had discov-ered their favorite artist and to provide a detailed account of the context. To help participants recall the situation, the re-searcher could ask additional questions, such as ‚ÄúWhen did you hear the music of that artist for the first time?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid someone make you listen to the music of that artist?‚Äù or \n34212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   ‚ÄúHad anyone discovered that artist because of you?‚Äù Partic-ipants were invited to position all alters generated by any of the three methods on their map, using the seven concentric circles to indicate the degree of emotional closeness with each of them.  Once the map was completed, a questionnaire was ad-ministered to the participants to collect information about each alter (e.g., age, gender, school level) and their rela-tionship with him or her (e.g., nature of relationship, fre-quency of contacts, duration of relationship). Participants were also asked to indicate, on a five-point scale ranging from ‚Äúvery different‚Äù to ‚Äúvery similar‚Äù, the degree of simi-larity between themselves and each alter in terms of musi-cal taste. With the objective of estimating the degree of in-strumentality of each alter for music discovery, participants were asked to indicate, on a five-point scale ranging from ‚Äúnever‚Äù to ‚Äúvery often,‚Äù how often they discovered new music because of him or her.  Because of the complexity of the task and the length of the accompanying questionnaire, the interviews with the participants lasted between 61 and 95 minutes (mean=79).  3.3 Participants and Sample Size Participants were recruited from a public school located in downtown Montr√©al. This school offers programs in French and English, from kindergarten to grade 11. All 10th and 11th grade students enrolled in the French sector (i.e., 173 students) were invited to participate in the study. Nineteen accepted the invitation, for a response rate of 10.9%. All lived within the greater Montr√©al area, 14 were female and 5 were male; 12 were in grade 10 and 7 in grade 11. The interviews with the participants elicited the names of 334 alters, which means that our sample was composed of 334 dyads or Ego-alter ties.  4. FINDINGS Although qualitative data were also gathered during the in-terviews, the present paper focuses on the analysis of the quantitative data collected via the social network mapping tool and the questionnaire about Ego-alter dyads. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the characteristics of the people and the ties that were considered instrumental for music discovery by the participants. Each participant named between 8 and 29 alters (mean=18.6; median=17), for a total of 334 alters for the 19 participants. Of the 334 alters, 137 (41%) were not consid-ered instrumental for discovering new music, which means that 197 (59%) were considered instrumental at various de-grees. To the question ‚ÄúHow often do you discover music because of this person?‚Äù participants responded ‚Äúrarely‚Äù for 61 alters (18%), ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù for 61 alters (18%), ‚Äúoften‚Äù for 46 alters (14%) and ‚Äúvery often‚Äù for 29 alters (9%).  A multinomial logistic regression was performed to ex-amine the attributes of the persons and ties that were per-ceived as instrumental. Multinomial logistic regressions are employed to handle cases where the dependent variable (in this case, the degree of instrumentality of a tie) is nominal or ordinal and has more than two classes, and the independ-ent variables are nominal, ordinal and/or continuous. Con-sidering the relatively small size of our sample, we some-times combined categories to increase the validity of the analysis. For instance, for the instrumental variable, we combined the 4th and 5th points of the five-point scale to create the ‚Äúvery instrumental‚Äù category; and the 2nd and 3rd points to create the ‚Äúsomewhat instrumental‚Äù category. Cat-egories were also combined for the variables emotional closeness, age and frequency of contacts. Results of the lo-gistic regression analysis are shown in Table 1.  4.1 Strength of Instrumental Ties The strength of a tie is usually estimated by a combination of factors, including emotional closeness and frequency of contacts. The logistic regression analysis shows that emo-tional closeness was associated with instrumentality: the odds for a close person (6th and 7th grades of the seven-point scale combined) to be considered very instrumental compared to an acquaintance (1st, 2nd and 3rd grades com-bined) were increased by a factor of 3.8. Pearson‚Äôs chi-square significance test (36.6, p<0.05) also confirmed the correlation between these variables. The duration of a relationship, on the other hand, was not found to be a predictor of the likelihood of a tie to be instrumental, but the frequency of contacts was. People par-ticipants saw at least 3 times a week were 1.6 times more likely to be considered instrumental for music discovery than people they saw less than once a week, and 2.0 times more likely to be very instrumental. A high frequency of mediated contacts (i.e., contacts by phone calls, SMS, chat or email) was also positively related to instrumentality, alt-hough this association lost its significance when both levels of instrumentality were considered. In all, we can safely say that ties through which participants discovered new music were mostly strong ties.  4.2 Nature of Relationship and Instrumentality The nature of the relationship was significantly related to instrumentality. Of special interest is the surprising finding that parents were positively related to instrumentality. In-deed, the odds of a parent being very instrumental were 5.7 times greater than for a friend. To be more specific, fathers seemed to be particularly instrumental. Of the 15 fathers mentioned, all were considered instrumental at various de-grees, and 7 were considered very instrumental. Of the 16 mothers, 3 were not considered instrumental and only 4 were considered very instrumental. The grandparents clear-ly belonged to a different category: the odds of grandpar-ents being instrumental were decreased by a factor 0.03 compared to friends. As for siblings, they were not signifi-cantly related to instrumentality. This finding should be in-terpreted carefully, however. Although the sample size did not allow for the consideration of more specific categories for the logistic regression, a look at the data suggests that younger and older siblings should probably be treated sepa-rately. Of the 13 younger brothers/sisters mentioned by the participants, 9 were considered ‚Äúnot instrumental‚Äù, 2 were ‚Äúsomewhat instru-mental‚Äù and 2 were ‚Äúvery instrumental‚Äù.  \n343Oral Session 5: User Studies\n   \n Table 1.

The logistic regression analysis on friendship ties showed that friends who were current schoolmates of the ego were 2.5 times more likely to be instrumental for discovering music than the friends attending a different school. Age was also significantly related to instrumentality. Compared with people over 50, the likelihood of being very instrumental for discovering music were increased by a factor of 4.5 for people in the 15-17 age category, by 7.6 for people in the 18-24 catego-ry, and by 5.3 for the people in the 25-49 category.   4.4 Homophily/Heterophily of Very Instrumental Ties Ties can also be characterized by their degree of ho-mophily or heterophily. To investigate that aspect, we compared the demographic characteristics of participants with those of very instrumental ties, as well as the global characteristics of the sample (see Table 2). When we look at the sample data, we notice that the participants‚Äô social networks were composed of a majority of homophilous ties in terms of age (60% of the alters mentioned were at most 1 year older or younger than the ego) and gender (69% of alters were the same sex than the ego). This is hardly surprising considering that, according to the prin-ciple of homophily (see Section 2), people tend to interact more with people who are similar to them. Perhaps of greater interest is the fact that people who were consid-ered by participants as being very instrumental for dis- covering new music followed almost exactly the same distribution for these variables, which means that instru- \nTable 2. Characteristics of very instrumental alters com-pared to characteristics of ego mental ties were also predominantly homophilous in age and gender. That being said, a non-negligible proportion of both the sample ties and the instrumental ties were much older than the ego (24% of all alters and 21% of very instrumental alters were more than 12 years older than Ego). In both cases, these people were mostly family members: Family members represented 93% of the much older alters and 94% of the much older very instrumental alters.  On some aspects, a greater proportion of the ties on which participants relied to expand their music repertoire were homophilous compared to the ties of the whole sam-ple. While 68% of the friends in the sample attended the same school than the ego, 92% of the friends who were very instrumental did. Unsurprisingly, an examination of the data on the similarity of musical taste shows that the distribution of the very instrumental ties was skewed to-wards the end of the scale whereas the ties of the whole sample seemed to follow a normal distribution. In other words, participants tended to prefer people in their social network who shared their musical taste to get music rec-ommendations. It should be noted, however, that not all alters who had very similar taste than Ego were consid-ered very instrumental (only 67% were), which means that a high degree of similarity in musical taste did not always lead to instrumentality for music discovery.  Overall, very instrumental ties included a similar or greater proportion of homophilous ties compared to all ties of the sample, depending on the characteristics we examine. This contradicts the idea that people tend to rely on weak and heterophilous ties to gain new information.  5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The data analysis revealed that discovering new music is dissimilar in many ways from other information-seeking situations. While previous research supports the im-portance of weak ties in the acquisition of new infor-mation, the present study concludes that the late adoles-cents we interviewed relied mostly on strong ties to ex-pand their music repertoire, that is, on people to which they felt very close and with whom they had frequent con-tacts. These ties were also predominantly homophilous in terms of age, gender and musical taste, although we high-lighted the fact that a minority but significant proportion of the very instrumental alters were much older than the participants. Related to that, we found that parents, and especially fathers, were more likely than friends or other types of kins to be instrumental for music discovery.  The analysis of the qualitative data collected during that project should help better understand these findings. In the meantime, we can provide some potential explana-tions. Three reasons can be offered for the important role strong ties play in this context.  Firstly, adolescents are very exposed to music, mainly because of recent techno-logical innovations. Music is widely available on the Web, legally or illegally, in streaming or for download, making it more accessible than it has ever been. Video-sharing sites such as YouTube also offer a wide variety of  Very instru-mental Sample  n % n % Age     Younger (more than 1 year) 3 4% 22 7% Same (¬± 1 year) 48 64% 199 60% Slightly older (2-12 years) 8 11% 33 10% Much older (more than 12 years) 16 21% 80 24% Gender     Same 22 29% 105 31% Different 53 71% 230 69% School (for friends)     Same 33 92% 105 68% Different 3 8% 50 32% Musical taste      Not similar 2 3% 36 13% Slightly similar 3 4% 62 22% Moderately similar 14 19% 77 28% Similar 34 45% 71 25% Very similar 22 29% 33 12% \n345Oral Session 5: User Studies\n   music videos, which can easily be shared using social networking sites. In addition, many adolescents have smartphones or portable music players on which they can carry large music collections they can share with their friends: seeing two adolescents splitting earphones to lis-ten to music together is very common. As a result, adoles-cents who are not highly invested in music might not feel the need to actively seek music recommendations. Sec-ondly, discovering music, although important in the con-struction of identity in adolescence, is certainly not as crucial in one‚Äôs life as seeking job- or health-related in-formation when needed. People might therefore be less inclined to make efforts to meet these needs and seek ad-vice from music mavens or from people whose job it is to recommend music (e.g., music store staff, librarians) but are less readily available. Thirdly, because of the subjec-tivity of music interpretation, as well as the attitudes and values associated with the music, recommending music requires a much better knowledge of the information-seeker than answering other types of information needs does, a knowledge that is difficult to grasp through a short interview. It is therefore plausible that adolescents prefer to rely on strong ties because they consider that people who know them well and know their taste provide more relevant recommendations.   We can also offer different possible explanations for the instrumentality of parents for music discovery. The Strength of Weak Ties theory could shed some light on this phenomenon. Although parents are strong ties, they are more heterophilous than friendship ties. Parents are much older and, as such, have been exposed to music from different periods. Considering that musical taste usually crystalizes in late adolescence, it is likely that the music to which they listen today dates, at least partly, from that period. Were it not for older people in their life, adolescents would possibly not be exposed to this music. However, this does not explain why parents were found to be more instrumental than uncles, aunts, or grandparents. Other explanations could be that they are more accessible and/or that music familiarity often leads to music appreci-ation [5]. As one participant of our pilot study put it, ‚ÄúThe songs you grew up with, whether you want it or not, you always end up listening to them again.‚Äù The findings of this research reiterate how complex the task of recommending relevant music is and how intri-cately bound musical taste is to social context. They sug-gest that a better understanding of the process through which people discover new music through friends, rela-tives or other acquaintances could provide some useful insights for the design of music recommender systems that integrated social networking features. Further re-search is now needed to investigate whether these results can be extended to other late adolescent populations or to older or younger populations.

INTRODUCTION  \nAudio Music Similarity and Retrieval (AMS) is one of the \nevaluation tasks conducted in Music Information Retrieval \nEvaluation eXchange  (MIREX).  AMS task  relies on human \nevaluation for ground truth. Evaluators are asked to listen to \na set of query -candidate  pairs and indicate  how similar they \nthink the songs are on a broad scale (i.e., very similar, \nsomewhat similar, not similar) as well as a fine scale (i.e., a \nscore between 0 -100). In 2010, the number of test quer ies \nwas 120 and each participating algorith m returned 5 results \nper query  [7]. Based on th e human evaluation, average pr e-\ncision scores are calculated for each algorithm and the \nranking of algorithms  is determined.     \nOne limitation with the design of the AMS  task is that \nevaluators are rating  only the similarity  between each of the \nquery -candidate pairs, not the candidate set  as a whole. \nMoreover, the evaluators are not given any background i n-formation on a use scenario; why  they are evaluating the \nsimilarity of the  songs and how those data will be used.   \nThe objective of this study is to explore one of the pote n-\ntial uses of t he AMS evaluation task . One way of using m u-\nsic similarity data is to generate playlists or recommend a-\ntions for users. How would users respond to the AMS re-\nsults if they w ere presented as playlist s generated for users \nto listen to? From the previous studies on playlists, we a l-\nready know that users value both variety and coherence in \ntheir playlists [ 4, 11], in other words, they want playlists \nwith songs that are similar to each other, but not too similar. \nHow does this Goldilocks -style similarity translate to AMS \nsimilarity metrics? W hen you compare the fine score given \nfor AMS results and the users ‚Äô evaluation of the results as \nplaylists, how similar or different are they?  Also can we \nlearn anything new about what users expect from playlists \nin addition to what we already know?  This paper presents \nthe findings from eight interviews conducted in order to a n-\nswer these questions.  \n2. DESIGN  OF THE STUDY  \n2.1 Test Collection  \nWe conducted in -depth interviews asking participants to \nlisten to a subset of the results of the MIREX 2010 AMS \ntask and evaluate the  candidate set a s playlists . 7 queries, \neach from different genres (i.e., blues, classical, country, \nelectronica, hip -hop, jazz, rock) were selected as test qu e-\nries. Of these 7 queries, each participant was asked to \nchoose at least 3 queries to evaluate. This was to ensure that \npartic ipants have some freedom to choose the  genre  that \nthey are familiar  with and most likely  to listen to in real life. \nTable 1 shows the list of queries tested in our study.  \nA total of 8 algorithms participated in 2010 AMS task, \nhowever, in order to reduce us er fatigue we tested candidate \nsets of only 3  algorithms for each query. The candidate sets \nfor blues, rock, and hip -hop were selected based on their  \naverage  fine scores such that they would have similar \nscores within genre and represent a spectrum of scores b e-\ntween genres. The classical, electronica, jazz, and country \ncandidate sets were chosen to represent a variety of average \nfine scores for the same query [See Table 2].  \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that co p-\nies bear this notice and the full cit ation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011  International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n109Poster Session 1\n  \n \nGenre  Query Title  Query Artist  \nBlues  Somebody's Been Talkin'   Blind Boy Fuller  \nClassical  Concerto No. 1 in C major \nPart 2  Monica Huggett  \nCountry  Sylvia's Mother  Bobby Bare  \nElectronica  Q-Works   Q-Factor  \nHip-Hop Paper Chase  The Mountain Brothers  \nJazz Time's Lie  Gary Meek  \nRock  Spank Thru  Nirvana  \nTable  1.

List of algorithms , the number of participants, \nsimilarity scores, and average ratings from participants   \n2.2 Task Design  \nEach candidate set was presented to participants as a \nplaylist consisting of 5 songs. The participants listened to \nthe 30 second clips of these songs , multiple times  if desired. \nWe used the 30 second clips rather than the whole songs to \nbe consistent with the A MS task and evaluation. The pa r-\nticipants were asked to imagine that these playlists were \ngenerated by 3 different systems that used the query as the \nseed song. After listening to the 3 candidate sets per query, \nthey were asked to rate each playlist on a 5 point scale and \nalso rank them. We asked the participants the reasons for \nliking or disliking the playlists, and also to imagine an id e-al playlist and what kinds of characteristics that playlist \nwould have or not have. The interview data were analyzed \nusing a grounded theory approach which allows us to ge n-\nerate a theory from  empirical  data [ 6].  \n2.3 Participants  \nParticipants were  recruited by using a snowball method \nstarting with the colleagues of the lead researcher  who are \ninterested in music . They were  selected so that they reflect \nsome variance in their preferred music genre and style. 3 of \nthe participants were in 20s, 2 were in 30s, and 3 were in \n40s. 6 participants were male and 2 were female. Most pa r-\nticipants listen to music at least occasionally,  although the \ndegree of their interests did vary. In the discussion below, \nresponses from different participants are identified by their \nassigned number ( i.e., P1‚ÄìP8). \n3. DATA AND DISCUSSION  \n3.1 Overview  \nTable 2 shows the list of algorithms that were tested for \neach query. The 4th column shows the average fine scores \nassigned to the candidate lists by the human evaluators in \nAMS task  [7]. The 5th column shows the average rating \nfrom our participants.  \n3.2 User Behaviors  \nIn the following, we  provide a list of  patterns that emerged \nfrom the user behaviors we ob served.  \n \n \nFigure 1 . Fine scores and average user ratings   \n3.2.1 Similarity does matter, but variety is also important  \nWhen we compared the fine scores with t he average ratings \nfrom our participants  for the 21 algorithms , we did o bserve \nsome co rrelation (Pearson‚Äôs r  = 0.66) . Figure 1 shows the \nscatterplot of the fine scores and the average user ratings. \nThere seem s to be a stronger correlation between the fine \nscores and the user ratings for the playlists with either very \nhigh similarity score or  very low similarity score. The 020406080100120\n0 1 2 3 4 5Fine Score  \nAverage User Rating  \n11012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nplaylists with med ium similarity scores ( around  60-80), on \nthe other hand,  do show greater variation in user rating . \nThis su ggests  that similarity does have some effect on how \npeople feel about the pla ylists, but other factors are having \nan impact as well.   \nOne common theme that emerged  from all the responses \nwas the importance  of variety as a ll eight partici pants said \nthat they want  some variety in the playlist. In fact, a nu m-\nber of participants  (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6)  reacted positively to \nthe playlists that had coherent set of songs, but also said \nsome lists were too similar and needed more variation (P1, \nP3, P4, P6, P7, P8).  \n \nP8: It‚Äôs kind of monotonous . The songs all had pretty \nmuch the same tempo ‚Ä¶it was all on 10 all the time, and \nthere‚Äôs no variety . And again all the tempos were the same,   \nthey all had big drums, and consistently all big sound .   \n \nFrom this quote, we  can see that for P8, the same tem po, \ninstrumentation, and style were the reasons why he felt that \nthe songs on the playlist were too similar. This participant  \nalso said it was okay to have multiple songs from the same \nartist, although other participants had different opinions.  \n \n P8: (Son gs from the same artists are) usually okay , be-\ncause if I like the band I want to hear more of it , and if I \ndon‚Äôt like them I already changed the channel.  \nP1: There ‚Äôs no lyrics in these so they kind of fit, but \nthree songs by the same artist on the same playlist is kind \nof, out of five, is a little bit, I think, extreme .  \n \nAs you can see, variety and coherence meant different \nthings for different participants . To name a few examples, \nP7 preferred  variation across genres, P1 wanted various  art-\nists, and P4 liked di verse musical style. Participants also \nfocused on different aspects when they said the playlist was \ncoherent. For example, P5 focused on lyrical content, \nwhereas P2 focused on tempo, P1 and P3 focused on mood, \netc. When user s perceive the variety or coherence of a \nplaylist, they will react different ly to different features, thus  \nthe transparen cy of the system  seems important as di s-\ncussed in [2, 13]. P4 expressed frustration that many of the \ncurrent systems provide playlists or recommendations \nwithout telling the user how exactly the songs were selected.  \n \nP4: There should be why did you get this song  maybe \nbecause I don‚Äôt understand most of the times, like I would \nput in the seed song and get these and I‚Äôm like , what is \ngoing on here?  \n \nIn fact, in √Öman and Liikkanen ‚Äôs survey of music re c-\nommendation systems [ 1], most of the systems received \nvery low scores for transparency. Some music recommen d-\ner systems do provide at least limited information about the songs to users. For instanc e, Pandora provides information \nabout the features of the selected songs that are taken into \naccount when they generate their playlists (e.g., it features \npop/rock qualities, a subtle use of paired vocal harmony , \nmixed acoustic and electric instrumentation ). The users, \nhowever, are not able to  specify which of these features \nthey want the system to focus on  in generating playlists. \nFor instance, some user may use Everlong  by Foo Fighters \nas his seed song because he want s songs with similar i n-\nstrumentation whereas another user may use the same seed \nsong wanting songs with romantic lyrics.  \n3.2.2 Metadata affects how users feel about the music  \nIn addition to relying on the musical features , various types \nof metadata  can be used to further improve the selection of \nsongs in a playlist . In previous works,  use of  song /album  \ntitle, artist, genre , user rating, etc.  have been discussed  [10, \n11, 12, 14]. In addition to these, we believe metadata such \nas lyrics can play a significant role. P6, for in stance, gave \nthe highest rating for one of the blues list because  of the \nsimilar  lyrical content. P2, P4 and P5 said they also create \ntheir own lists based on lyrics . Moreover, P5 and P7 said  \nthey want to be able to filter songs that have graphic lyrics .  \nOther potentially  useful metadata mentioned by our pa r-\nticipants was the theme. P4, P5, and P8  said that they create \ntheir own lists based on a theme /story (e.g., trains, 4th of \nJuly). The theme of the song may be automatically extrac t-\ned, inferred from  the title or lyrics , or assigned by users \nthough social  tagging. Time period was also important for \nour participants . P1, P2, and P3 mentioned that the songs in \nthe given playlist were from different era and that negativ e-\nly affected how they felt about it (e.g., mix of different \nclassical music periods, rock music from 80s and 90s). P2 \nsaid that the song from different time period s ‚Äúdisrupted the \nflow‚Äù of the playlist. P1 also mentioned  the difference in \nthe quality of sound recordings from different eras.   \n \n P3: The slightly jarring thing is ‚Ä¶that first seed sounded \nto me more like sort of baroque music so like in the 16th or \n17th century  and then from what I remember of the ones in \nthe playlist, they were sort of like 18th century and some \n19th century  stuff at the end ‚Ä¶not the same time period .  \nP1: A lot of this older country music that was recorded \nbefore modern recording equipment, has this kind of echoy, \ntin canny sound to it, right? And I don‚Äôt like that.  That re-\nally muffled poor recording ‚Ä¶I just c an‚Äôt get over that.  \n3.2.3 Having a song users love or hate can significantly a f-\nfect how they feel about the whole playlist  \nPersonal preference  of music highly affected how people \nfelt about the playlist as a whole. Participants  seemed  de-\nlighted  when they heard the song or artist they liked. Some \n111Poster Session 1\n  \n \nspecifically s tated  that they were  rating the playlist higher \nbecause they really liked one of the songs.  \n \nP8: Actually the other one probably should have been 2  \n(which he rated 3), but I really love that Foo Fighter so ng \nso‚Ä¶ How can you dislike that melody line? La la la la la‚Ä¶  \nP1: Learn to Fly was very poppy so it didn‚Äôt quite fit but \nyou know, I like that song so that doesn‚Äôt really bother me \ntoo much . And I like Soundgarden so that‚Äôs good .  \n \nThe overall preference of the genre or musical style also \nmattered. For instance, P3 said ‚ÄúI just prefer  more upbeat \nsongs in general ‚Äù, or some participants preferred a partic u-\nlar sub-genre (e.g., P1 likes country rock, P4 likes swing \njazz, P6 likes alt ro ck) and seeing songs  that fit those crit e-\nria on the playlist made them respond more positively.  \nSometimes user‚Äôs preference overrode the similarity.    \n \nP4: I really like this playlist cause I like the music on it  \nbecause I‚Äôm more, I‚Äôm way more into the swing side of \njazz but I don‚Äôt really think any of these songs go with the \nseed song very much .  \n \nWhile explaining the characteristics of their ideal playlist,  \na number of participants (P1, P4, P8) specifically said that \nthey want to see more songs by the seed artist . Currently in \nAMS task, the seed artist is filtered from the results.  \n \nP4: I never seem to get in your playlist the same artist \nas your seed song, what is up with that?  Obviously I like \nthis artist, why do you not intersperse more of that artist?   \n \nParticipants also had strong reactions to the music that \nthey hated  as discussed in [3] . Having even a single  song \nthat they dislike significantly affected how they rate d the \nplaylist as a whole. For instance, P3 and P4  who listened to \nthe jazz s et commented that one of the songs  sounded like  \nelevator music  which made them absolutely hate the list .  \n \nP3: Oh, god, elevator music . I loathe elevator music.  \nP4: This is like elevator music . It‚Äôs too  early in the \nmorning for this...and I‚Äôm offended that  like elevator m u-\nsic is associated with Jazz.  There is kind of a bit of an o f-\nfensive thing  going on there. You put in Jazz and you get \nlike, is that what people think?  This gets a zero. \n \nThis suggests  that perhaps providing a way to perm a-\nnently ba n a song , like in  systems like Musicovery , is i m-\nportant to users. 4  participants (P3, P4, P7, P8) specifically \nsaid that they  want to be able to remove songs that they \nhate so that it will never appear in any of their playlists. P3 \nsaid ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what I like, b ut I know for sure what I \nDON ‚ÄôT like .‚Äù P8 said ‚Äúall the songs have to be able to \nstand by itself ‚Äù without ‚Äúthe second rate songs .‚Äù  \n P8: (answering the question ‚ÄúAnything that this ideal \nplaylist should not have?‚Äù) Van Halen. It shouldn‚Äôt have \nmusic that s ucks .  \n3.2.4 Users like learning new things, but they still want \nthem contextualized in familiar  territory  \nSeveral participants stated  that they like learn ing something \nnew and be ing exposed to new songs by listening to these \nplaylists.  \n \n     P3: I kind of want the system that educates me . You \nknow, that picks things that I don ‚Äôt really know about . \nP7: The Van Halen  cover of the Who. I had no idea that \nsong existed so that ‚Äôs (good) , I love learning things , that‚Äôs \nwhy I go to things like Pandora .  \n \nFinding new songs by a known artist was also a positive \nthing , like P8 who was happy to learn one of the Foo Figh t-\ners songs. P7 said re -discovering songs that were once f a-\nmiliar but forgotten was also a positive experience. Another \nnotable pattern was that  all par ticipants wanted a mix of \nfamiliar and new songs, although there w ere disagreement s \non the ideal proportion of familiar and new songs. Field s [5] \nalso advocates a playlist (familiar  songs) with recomme n-\ndation (new songs) , although playlists  are typically d istin-\nguished from recommendations [4]. Having familiar  and \nnew songs together on the list can perhaps  help users by \nenabling them to establish the context, understand the co n-\nnections between the songs better and remember the new \nsongs better.  \n \nP6: A mix of things is good, cause I would like to disco v-\ner new artists , it‚Äôs always a good way to  (be) introduced \nthrough somewhat similar artists you already like ‚Ä¶I‚Äôll \nfeel more comfortable get ting into the genre  if there ‚Äôs a \nfew (songs) I kind of knew , and then I could kind a deter-\nmine my likes from there.   \n3.2.5 Users tend to be  more generous for unfamiliar music  \nParticipants also reacted differently to the genre based on \ntheir familiarity. Better f amiliarity with the genre seemed to \nlead to stronger criticisms  and disappointment, higher e x-\npectation, and more intense reaction. It also led to lower \nratings  overall, compared to the playlists in a genre that \nparticipants were less familiar with. For instance, when \nevaluating the same electronic playlist , P8 thought  they all \nsounded okay and similar enough to the seed  whereas P1  \npoint ed out the mix of different sub -genres and gave lower \nscores.  The participants, in fact, were aware of this beha v-\nior themselves.  \n \nP8: I feel like  I can learn about the genres that I don‚Äô t \nknow much about ‚Ä¶so I‚Äôm way more likely to just sort of \n11212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \ngo along, go with the flow and see what I learn  whereas \nusually if I‚Äôm listening to something  I‚Äôm familiar with ‚Ä¶I \nwant the songs to have like consistent values , production \nvalues, song writing values, um, I‚Äôm just way pickier.     \nP2: Because I know this genre so well, I feel like I be-\ncome pickier , yeah, my expectations are higher.  \n3.2.6 Users  know and will tell you  about  their boundaries   \nOverall, participants tended to be very aware and assertive \nabout their boundaries : what they like and dislike , how \nmuch variation they can tolerate , and other little quirks . For \ninstance, both P5 and P8 said they did not like songs that \nwere anti-social . P4 said the mix of vocal and instrumental \nmusic was intolerable .  \n \nP4:  That third choral thing has to go. That was wrong . I \nliked the rest of the playlist but that one just ‚Ä¶I couldn ‚Äôt \nsee why it came up, I really didn ‚Äôt like i t‚Ä¶To me they \nwould be different channels, different categories .  \n \nParticipants  also had different reaction s to the rando m-\nness of the playlists. P5 said ‚ÄúI didn ‚Äôt like the song in fo r-\neign, Northern European ? Language because I couldn ‚Äôt \nfigure out what it was a bout‚Äù although P3 liked the ra n-\ndomness of the German jazz song .   \n \nP3: That was the most bizarre combination ‚Ä¶ it would \nbe kind of fun  to be sort of given this and just be playing it \nin the car thinking oh I wonder what‚Äôs gonna happen \nnext... this is like a  weird mystery gift , you know, like the \nChristmas present from your mad auntie.  \n4. IMPLICATIONS  ON SIMILARITY EVALUA TION  \nBased on our interview data, we have four recommend a-\ntions for possibly improving  the AMS task in MIREX.  The \nformer two recommendations aim to facilitate obtaining \nmore objective results, and the latter  two are for making the \nAMS task more user -centric.    \n4.1 Specif ication of Features  \nOur participants considered a variety of features when they \nevaluate d the playlists. Examples of commented features \ninclude mood, genre, lyrical content, tempo, instrument a-\ntion, delivery , time period, style, and so on. They assumed \nthat the songs on the playlists were selected because of \nsome combination of these different features , although u n-\ncertain as to whi ch exact features were used . This multi -\nfaceted notion of music similarity makes it difficult to eva l-\nuate similarity since there are so many different ways two \nmusic clips can be similar  (c.f., [8]) . In MIREX, we cu r-\nrently collect evaluators‚Äô  opinion s on how similar the qu e-\nry-candidate pairs are , but not on which aspects they \nthought were similar. One possible way to remedy  this lim i-tation would be to inform  the evaluators which aspect s they \nshould focus on  during the evaluation in order  to obtain \nmore obje ctive results. Another measure would be to ask \nthe evaluators to tell us which  aspect s made them think the \nresults were similar or not. Although t his proposed solution  \nmay slightly increase users ‚Äô burden, we will be able to o b-\ntain more objec tive judgments as well as richer information \non the relative importance of features for users.   \n4.2 Identification of E valuator ‚Äôs Genre P reference and \nFamiliari ty  \nCollecting information about evaluator‚Äô s preference and \nfamiliarity may enable us to gauge how m uch we can trust \nthe response from each evaluator. As discussed in section s \n3.2.2 and 3.2.6 , participants did react differently to playlists \nof different genres based on their preference and familiarity . \nThe background knowledge of the familiar and liked genre \nallowed the participants to evaluate the playlist based on a \nlot of contextual  information  (e.g., P1: ‚Äú Van Halen was \nkind of like  hair metal ‚Äù P6: ‚Äú if you are going to input Ni r-\nvana, maybe you want some other smaller , pacific Nort h-\nwest, grungy , 90s‚Äù). On the other hand, they found it diff i-\ncult to evaluate the lists if they did not know the genre very \nwell. For instance, all 3 participants (P5, P7, P8) said that \nthey listen to hip-hop but have limited knowledge of th e \ngenre which made it difficult to  evaluate the playlists.   \n4.3 Providing Metadata with the Music Clips  \nIn MIREX, human evaluators are not provided with \nmetadata such as artist or title of the music clips they eva l-\nuate. Although this will help ensure that the similarity \njudgment is strictly based on the music itself  not metadata, \nit does not reflect the real -life music experience of use rs. In \nany commercial system, the ultimate objective  is to deliver \nmusic to users  who will want to know what exactly they are \npurchasing. Even for non -commercial systems, metadata \nwill be crucial for educating the users about music. Note \nthat evalua tion of music playlist is also affected by the  \navailability of  metadata.  \n \nP1: (reacting to three songs from the same artist) I don ‚Äôt \nknow. If you didn ‚Äôt show me the metadata, I might not \nknow, or I might not have that kind of reaction.   \n \nAlso 4  of our participants (P1, P6, P7, P8) discussed the \nconnection of Nirvana to Foo Fighters when they evaluated \nthe rock playlists. P7 said ‚ÄúFoo Fighters is pretty obvious ‚Äù \nand P1 said ‚Äúit sounds different from the seed but it makes \nsense ,‚Äù demonstrating the importance of artist information. \nP7 also said contextual information like  ‚Äúthe influences b e-\ntween bands ‚Äù was important in making a good playlist . \nProviding even the basic metadata such as artist, song title \nand genre with the music clips can help users better unde r-\n113Poster Session 1\n  \n \nstand the context of music.  This is also much closer  to how \nusers will respond to music playlists in real life.    \n4.4 Tasks  Reflecting  Real-life Use Scenarios  \nThe current music similarity task relies on human evalu a-\ntors for generating ground truth;  however  it is unclear how \nthis information is going to be used in real life. Music simi-\nlarity  can be used for many user tasks other than just crea t-\ning playlists; for instance, Lee [9] discusses t he use of m u-\nsic similarity for known -item searches (e.g., trying to find a \nspecific song by providing other song titles that sound very \nsimilar)  on Google Answers . In this case, we suspect that  \ncandidates with higher similarity scores may be more useful \nfor the user task.  \nWe believe it is crucial that the MIR community as a \nwhole think about how the current tasks can be evolved into \ntasks that are more user -centric, in other words, closer  to \nthe user tasks that actually happen in their everyday life. \nOne possibility for evolving the current AMS task is to cr e-\nate different sub-tasks that use music similarity; for i n-\nstance, playlist generation task, known -item search task, \npersonal music collection management task , and so on.  \n5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE  WORK  \nThe findings of our study suggest that  similarity is only one \nof the many factors that affect how people feel about \nplaylists . Although similarity does seem to affect the user \nrating of playlist, stronger  similarity do es not always  make \nbetter playlists for users. Overall, participants had fairly \nclear ideas about what they expe ct from a good playlist and \nwere able to articulate them . Their e valuation of playlists \ntended to be quite  subjective as they were highly affected \nby personal preference and familiarity with the music on \nthe list, although some common themes emerged , such as \nwanting a mix of familiar and new songs, more songs from \nthe seed artist , etc. Many of the user behaviors o bserved \nduring the interview s confirm and support various points \nthat were raised in previous literature on music sim ilarity, \nrecommendation , playlists, and evalua tion. This  is promi s-\ning as there do seem to be a set of features that we can i m-\nplement in current systems to make them more user -centric.  \nWe hope that findings  from this study will provide us e-\nful information for redesigning the current AMS task  and \nencourage the MIR community to think about how to \nevolve the current evaluation tasks.  In our future studies, \nwe plan to test more playlists generated by different alg o-\nrithms submitted to MIREX based on different set of seed \nsongs. Ins tead of researchers selecting random songs for \nusers to test, we plan to have the users select the seed songs \nthat they actually like and are more likely to use for elici t-\ning playlists in real life.  6.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic is composed from rhythm, pitches, and timbres, and\nmusic is played with expression and interpretation. Omit-\nting some of these characteristics may seem unfair. Can the\nrhythm alone be representative of a song or a genre?\nSmall rhythmic patterns are essential for the balance of\nthe music, and can be a way to identify a song. One may\nÔ¨Årst think of some clich ¬¥es: start of Beethoven 5th symphony ,\ndrum pattern from We will rock you or Ravel‚Äôs Bol¬¥ero. More\ngenerally, Query By Tapping (QBT) studies, where the user\ntaps on a microphone [10,12], are able in some situations to\nidentify a monophonic song. On a larger scale, musicolo-\ngists have studied how rhythm, like tonality, can structure a\npiece at different levels [5, 16].\nThis article shows how simple extractions can, starting\nfrom a polyphony, build relevant monophonic signatures,\nbeing able to be used for the identiÔ¨Åcation of songs or for\nthe comparison of whole pieces.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.In fact, most rhythm-only studies in Music Information\nRetrieval (MIR) concern audio signal . These techniques of-\nten rely in detection of auto-correlations in the signal. Some\nstudies output descriptors [9, 15, 17] that can be used for\nfurther retrieval or classiÔ¨Åcation. Several papers focus on\napplications of non-Western music [11, 13, 24].\nThere are other tools that mix audio with symbolic data ,\ncomparing audio signals against symbolic rhythmic pattern.\nFor example, the QBT wave task of MIREX 2010 proposed\nthe retrieval of monophonic MIDI Ô¨Åles from wave input\nÔ¨Åles. Some solutions involve local alignments [10]. Another\nproblem is rhythm quantization, for example when aligning\naudio from music performances against symbolic data. This\ncan be solved with probabilistic frameworks [2]. Tempo and\nbeat detection are other situations where one extracts sym-\nbolic information from audio data [7, 18].\nSome rhythm studies work purely on symbolic MIDI data,\nbut where the input is not quantized [22], as in the QBT\nsymbolic task in MIREX 2010. Again, challenges can come\nfrom quantization, tempo changing and expressive interpre-\ntations. Finally, on the side of quantized symbolic music ,\nthe Mongeau and Sankoff algorithm takes into account both\npitches and rhythms [14]. Extensions concerning polyphony\nhave been proposed [1]. Other symbolic MIR studies focus\non rhythm [3, 4, 19‚Äì21].\nHowever, as far as we know, a framework for rhythmic\nextraction from polyphonic symbolic music has never been\nproposed. Starting from a polyphonic symbolic piece, what\nare the pertinent ways to extract a monophonic rhythmic\nsequence? Section 2 presents comparison of rhythmic se-\nquences through local alignment, Section 3 proposes dif-\nferent rhythm extractions, and Section 4 details evaluations\nof these extractions for the identiÔ¨Åcation of musical pieces\nwith exact pattern matching (Section 4.2) and on similarity\nqueries between complete pieces (Sections 4.3 and 4.4).\n2. RHYTHM COMPARISONS\n2.1 Representation of monophonic rhythm sequences\nFor tempo-invariance, several studies on tempo or beat track-\ning on audio signal use relative encoding [10]. As we start\nfrom symbolic scores, we suppose here that the rhythms are\nalready quantized on beats, and we will not study tempo and\n375Poster Session 3\nmeter parameters. If necessary, multiple queries handle the\ncases where the tempo is doubled or halved.\nRhythm can be represented in different ways. Here, we\nmodel each rhythm as a succession of durations between\nnotes, i.e. inter-onset intervals measured in quarter notes or\nfractions of them (Figure 1).\n /noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2\nMusic engraving by LilyPond 2.12.3‚Äîwww.lilypond.org\nFigure 1 . The monophonic rhythm sequence (1, 0.5, 0.5, 2).\nThus, in this simple framework, there are no silences,\nsince each note, except the last one, is considered until the\nbeginning of the following note.\n2.2 Monophonic rhythm comparison\nSeveral rhythm comparisons have been proposed [21]. Here,\nwe compare rhythms while aligning durations. Let S(m,n)\nbe the best score to locally align a rhythm sequence x1...xm\nto another one y1...yn. This similarity score can be com-\nputed via a dynamic programming equation (Figure 2), by\ndiscarding the pitches in the Mongeau-Sankoff equation [14].\nThe alignment can then be retrieved through backtracking in\nthe dynamic programming table.\nS(a,b) = maxÔ£±\nÔ£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≤\nÔ£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£¥Ô£≥S(a‚àí1,b‚àí1) +Œ¥(xa,yb)\n(match, substitution s)\nS(a‚àí1,b) +Œ¥(xa,‚àÖ)\n(insertion i)\nS(a,b‚àí1) +Œ¥(‚àÖ,yb)\n(deletion d)\nS(a‚àík,b‚àí1) +Œ¥({xa‚àík+1...xa},yb)\n(consolidation c)\nS(a‚àí1,b‚àík) +Œ¥(xa,{yb‚àík+1...yb})\n(fragmentation f)\n0 (local alignment)\nFigure 2 .

RHYTHM EXTRACTION\nHow can we extract, from a polyphony, a monophonic rhyth-\nmic texture? In this section, we propose several rhythmic\nextractions. Figure 4 presents an example applying these\nextractions on the beginning of a chorale by J.-S. Bach.\nThe simplest extraction is to consider all onsets of the\nsong, reducing the polyphony to a simple combined mono-\nphonic track. This ‚Äú noteson extraction‚Äù extracts durations\nfrom the inter-onset intervals of all consecutive groups of\nnotes. For each note or each group of notes played simul-\ntaneously, the considered duration is the time interval be-\ntween the onset of the current group of notes and the fol-\nlowing onset. Each group of notes is taken into account\nand is represented in the extracted rhythmic pattern. How-\never, such a noteson extraction is not really representative of\nthe polyphony: when several notes of different durations are\nplayed at the same time, there may be some notes that are\nmore relevant than others.\nIn symbolic melody extraction, it has been proposed to\nselect the highest (or the lowest) pitch from each group of\nnotes [23]. Is it possible to have similar extractions when\none considers the rhythms? The following paragraphs intro-\nduce several ideas on how to choose onsets and durations\nthat are most representative in a polyphony. We will see in\nSection 4 that some of these extractions bring a noticeable\nimprovement to the noteson extraction.\n3.1 Considering length of notes: long,short\nFocusing on the rhythm information, the Ô¨Årst idea is to take\ninto account the effective lengths of notes. At a given onset,\nfor a note or a group of notes played simultaneously:\n‚Ä¢in the long extraction, all events occurring during the\nlength of the longest note are ignored. For example,\nas there is a quarter on the Ô¨Årst onset of Figure 4, the\nsecond onset (eighth, tenor voice) is ignored;\n37612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2intensity+ /accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/brackettips.up/brackettips.down/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/flags.d3/accidentals.sharp\nintensity‚Äì /flags.u3/flags.d3\nlong /noteheads.s2/scripts.ufermata/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/clefs.G/accidentals.sharp/timesig.C44/clefs.G/accidentals.sharp/timesig.C44/clefs.G/accidentals.sharp/timesig.C44/clefs.F/accidentals.sharp/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/scripts.ufermata/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/scripts.ufermata/noteheads.s2/scripts.ufermata/dots.dotnoteson /accidentals.sharpshort /noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/rests.3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/dots.dot\n/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/flags.u3/accidentals.sharp/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/flags.u3Figure 4 . Rhythm extraction on the beginning of the Bach\nchorale BWV 278.\n‚Ä¢similarly, for the short extraction, all events occur-\nring during the length of the shortest note are ignored.\nThis extraction is often very close to the noteson ex-\ntraction.\nIn both cases, as some onsets may be skipped, the con-\nsidered duration is the time interval between the onset of\nthe current group of notes and the following onset that is\nnot ignored. Most of the time, the short extraction is not\nvery different from the noteson , whereas the long extraction\nbrings signiÔ¨Åcant gains in similarity queries (see Section 4).\n3.2 Considering intensity of onsets: intensity+/‚àí\nThe second idea is to consider a Ô¨Ålter on the number of notes\nat the same event, keeping only onsets with at least knotes\n(intensity+) or strictly less than knotes ( intensity‚àí), where\nthe threshold kis chosen relative to the global intensity of\nthe piece. The considered durations are then the time inter-\nvals between consecutive Ô¨Åltered groups. Figure 4 shows an\nexample with k= 3. This extraction is the closest to what\ncan be done on audio signals with peak detection.\n4. RESULTS AND EV ALUATION\n4.1 Protocol\nStarting from a database of about 7000 MIDI Ô¨Åles (including\n501 classical, 527 jazz/latin, 5457 pop/rock), we selected\nthe quantized Ô¨Åles by a simple heuristic (40 % of onsets on\nbeat, eighth or eighth tuplet). We thus kept 5900 MIDI Ô¨Åles\nfrom Western music, sorted into different genres (including\n204 classical, 419 jazz/latin, 4924 pop/rock). When applica-\nble, we removed the drum track (MIDI channel 10) to avoid\nour rhythm extractions containing too many sequences of\neighth notes, since drums often have a repetitive structure in\npopular Western music. Then, for each rhythm extractionpresented in the previous section, we extracted all database\nÔ¨Åles. For each Ô¨Åle, the intensity+/‚àíthresholdkwas choosen\nas the median value between all intensities. For this, we\nused the Python framework music21 [6].\nOur Ô¨Årst results are on Exact Song identiÔ¨Åcation (Sec-\ntion 4.2). We tried to identify a song by a pattern of several\nconsecutive durations taken from a rhythm extraction, and\nlooked for the occurrences of this pattern in all the songs of\nthe database.\nWe then tried to determinate if these rhythm extractions\nare pertinent to detect similarities. We tested two particular\ncases, Ragtime (Section 4.3) and Bach chorales variations\n(Section 4.4). Both are challenging for our extraction meth-\nods, because they present difÔ¨Åculties concerning polyphony\nand rhythm: Ragtime has a very repetitive rhythm on the\nleft hand but a very free right hand, and Bach chorales have\nrhythmic differences between their different versions.\n4.2 Exact Song IdentiÔ¨Åcation\nIn this section, we look for patterns of consecutive notes\nthat are exactly matched in only one Ô¨Åle among the whole\ndatabase. For each rhythm extraction and for each length be-\ntween 5and50, we randomly selected 200 distinct patterns\nappearing in the Ô¨Åles of our database. We then searched for\neach of these patterns in all the 5900 Ô¨Åles (Figure 5).\n 1 10 100 1000\n 5  10  15  20  25  30  35Matching files (among 5900)\nPattern lengthnoteson\nshort\nlong\nintensity-\nintensity+\nFigure 5 . Number of matching Ô¨Åles for patterns between\nlength 5 and 35. Curves with points indicate median values,\nwhereas other curves indicate average values.\nWe see that as soon as the length grows, the patterns are\nvery speciÔ¨Åc. For lengths 10, 15 and 20, the number of pat-\nterns (over 200) matching one unique Ô¨Åle is as follows:\nExtraction 10 notes 15 notes 20 notes\nnoteson 49 85 107\nshort 58 100 124\nlong 85 150 168\nintensity+91 135 158\nintensity‚àí109 137 165\n377Poster Session 3\nWe notice that the long andintensity+/‚àíextractions are\nmore speciÔ¨Åc than noteson . From 12notes, the median val-\nues of Figure 5 are equal to 1 except for noteson andshort\nextractions. In more than 70% of these queries, 15 notes are\nsufÔ¨Åcient to retrieve a unique Ô¨Åle.\nThe results for average values are disturbed by a few pat-\nterns that match a high number of Ô¨Åles. Figure 6 displays\nsome noteworthy patterns with 10 notes. Most of the time,\nthe patterns appearing very frequently are repetitions of the\nsame note, such as pattern (a). With long extraction, 174\nÔ¨Åles contain 30 consecutive quarters, and 538 Ô¨Åles contain\n30 consecutive eighths. As these numbers further increase\nwith noteson (and short ) extractions, this explains why the\nlong extraction can be more speciÔ¨Åc.\n /noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2noteson long/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(3299) (1465) a./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(396) (279) b./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(143) (114) c./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/dots.dot/noteheads.s2(43) (53) d./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(7) (18) e./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s1/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2(6) (10) f./noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2(0) (1) g./flags.u3/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2\nMusic engraving by LilyPond 2.12.3‚Äîwww.lilypond.org\nFigure 6 . Some patterns with 10 durations, with the number\nof matching Ô¨Åles in noteson andlong extractions.\nThe number of occurrences of each pattern is mostly de-\ntermined by its musical relevance. For example, in a pat-\ntern with three durations, (d) appears more often than (g),\nwhich is quite a difÔ¨Åcult rhythm. In the same way, among\npatterns with only quarters and eighths, (b) and (c) can be\nfound more often than (f). We also notice that patterns with\nlonger durations, even repetitive ones such as pattern (e),\ngenerally appear in general less frequently than those con-\ntaining shorter durations.\n4.3 Similarities in Ragtime\nIn this section and the following, we use the similarity score\ncomputation explained in Section 2.2. Ragtime music, one\nof the precursors of Jazz music, has a strict tempo main-\ntained by the pianist‚Äôs left hand and a typical swing created\nby a syncopated melody in the right hand.\nFor this investigation, we gathered 17 ragtime Ô¨Åles. Then\nwe compared some of these ragtime Ô¨Åles against a set of Ô¨Åles\ncomprising the 17 ragtime Ô¨Åles and randomly selected Ô¨Åles\nof the database. We tested several scores functions: always\n+1for a match, and‚àí10,‚àí5,‚àí2,‚àí1,‚àí1/2or‚àí1/3foran error. We further tested no penalty for consolidation and\nfragmentation (c/f).\n 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1True positive rate (sensibility)\nFalse positive rate (1 - specificity)noteson [0.794]\nlong [0.861]\nFigure 7 . Best ROC Curves, with associated AUC, for re-\ntrieving 17 Ragtime pieces from the query A Ragtime Night-\nmare , by Tom Turpin, in a set of 100 Ô¨Åles.\nFigure 7 shows ROC Curves for A Ragtime Nightmare . A\nROC Curve [8] plots sensibility (capacity to Ô¨Ånd true posi-\ntives) and speciÔ¨Åcity (capacity to eliminate false positives)\nover a range of thresholds, giving a way to ascertain the per-\nformance of a classiÔ¨Åer that outputs a ranked list of results.\nHere one curve represents one rhythm extraction with one\nscore function. For each score function, we computed the\ntrue positive and the false positive rates according to all dif-\nferent thresholds. The long extraction, used with scores +1\nfor a match and‚àí1for all errors, gives here very good re-\nsults: for example, the circled point on Figure 7 corresponds\nto 0.88 sensitivity and 0.84 speciÔ¨Åcity with a threshold of 45\n(i.e. requiring at least 45 matches).\nConsidering the whole curve, the performance of such a\nclassiÔ¨Åer can be measured with the AUC (Area Under ROC\nCurve). Averaging on 9 different queries, the best set of\nscores for each extraction is as follows:\nExtraction Scores Mean AUC\ns/i/d c/f match\nnoteson‚àí5 0 +1 0.711\nshort‚àí1‚àí1 +1 0.670\nlong‚àí1 0 +1 0.815\nintensity+‚àí1/3 0 +1 0.622\nintensity‚àí‚àí1‚àí1 +1 0.697\nMost of the time, the matching sequences are long se-\nquences of eighths, similar to pattern (a) of Figure 6. If such\npatterns are frequent in noteson database Ô¨Åles (see previous\nsection), their presence in long Ô¨Åles is more frequent in Rag-\ntime than in other musical styles. For example, pattern (a)\nis found in 76 % of Ragtime long extractions, compared to\nonly 25 % of the whole database.\nIndeed, in ragtime scores, the right hand is very swift\nand implies a lot of syncopations, while the left hand is bet-\n37812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n /noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/rests.4/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s242424242/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/clefs.F42/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/accidentals.flat/clefs.G/rests.4/dots.dot/dots.dot/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/dots.dot/dots.dot/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/rests.4/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2\nintensity+ long noteson /brackettips.up/brackettips.down/accidentals.natural/accidentals.natural/accidentals.natural/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/rests.4/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2\nMusic engraving by LilyPond 2.12.3‚Äîwww.lilypond.orgFigure 8 .Possum Rag (1907), by Geraldine Dobyns.\nter structured.

In fact, intensity+\nextraction keeps the syncopation of the piece, as accents in\nthe melody often involve chords that will pass through the\nintensity+Ô¨Ålter (Figure 8, last note of intensity+).\n4.4 Similarities in Bach Chorales Variations\nSeveral Bach chorales are variations of each other, shar-\ning an exact or very similar melody. Such chorales present\nmainly variations in their four-part harmony, leading to dif-\nferences in their subsequent rhythm extractions (Figure 9).\nBWV 4.8/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2BWV 158.4/dots.dot/timesig.C44/accidentals.sharp/clefs.G/noteheads.s2BWV 278/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/timesig.C44/flags.u3/flags.u3/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/scripts.ufermata/noteheads.s2BWV 277/dots.dot/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/flags.u3/accidentals.sharp/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2/noteheads.s2\nFigure 9 . Extraction of long rhythm sequences from differ-\nent variations of the start of the chorale Christ lag in Todes-\nbanden . The differences between variations are due to dif-\nferences in the rhythms of the four-part harmonies.\nFor this investigation, we considered a collection of 404\nBach chorales transcribed by www.jsbchorales.net\nand available in the music21 corpus [6]. We selected 5\nchorales that have multiple versions: Christ lag in Todes-\nbanden (5 versions, including a perfect duplicate), Wer nun\nden lieben Gott (6 versions), Wie nach einer Wasserquelle\n(6 versions), Herzlich tut mich verlangen (9 versions), and\nO Welt, ich muss dich lassen (9 versions).For each chorale, we used one version to query against\nthe set of all other 403 chorales, trying to retrieve the most\nsimilar results. A ROC curve with BWV 278 as a query is\nshown in Figure 10. For example, with intensity+extraction\nand scores‚àí1fors/i/d , 0 forc/f, and +1for a match,\nthe circled point corresponds to a threshold of 26, with 0.80\nsensitivity and 0.90 speciÔ¨Åcity. Averaging on all 5 chorales,\nthe best set of scores for each extraction is as follows:\nExtraction Scores Mean AUC\ns/i/d c/f match\nnoteson‚àí1 0 +1 0.769\nshort‚àí1 0 +1 0.781\nlong‚àí5‚àí5 +1 0.871\nintensity+‚àí1 0 +1 0.880\nintensity‚àí‚àí5 0 +1 0.619\nEven if the noteson extractions already gives good results,\nlong andintensity+bring noteworthy improvements. Most\nof the time, the best scores correspond to alignments be-\ntween 8 and 11 measures, spanning a large part of the cho-\nrales. We thus managed to align almost globally one chorale\nand its variations. We further checked that there is not a bias\non total length: for example, BWV 278 has a length of ex-\nactly 64 quarters, as do 15% of all the chorales, but the score\ndistribution is about the same in these chorales than in the\nother ones.\n 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1True positive rate (sensibility)\nFalse positive rate (1 - specificity)noteson [0.636]\nlong [0.787]\nintensity [0.904]\nFigure 10 .

DISCUSSION\nIn all our experiments, we showed that several methods are\nmore speciÔ¨Åc than a simple noteson extraction (or than the\nsimilar short extraction). The intensity‚àíextraction could\nprovide the most speciÔ¨Åc patterns used as signature (see Fig-\nure 5), but is not appropriate to be used in similarity queries.\nThelong andintensity+extractions give good results in the\nidentiÔ¨Åcation of a song, but also in similarity queries inside\na genre or variations of a music.\n379Poster Session 3\nIt remains to measure what is really lost by discarding\npitch information: our perspectives include the comparison\nof our rhythm extractions with others involving melody de-\ntection or drum part analysis.\nAcknowledgements.

Analysis of the tapping data\nand labels chosen shows that, while different listeners fre-\nquently entrain to different metrical levels for some pieces,\nthey rarely disagree about which pieces are fast and which\nare slow. We show how this result can be used to improve\nboth the evaluation metrics used for automatic tempo esti-\nmation and the estimation algorithms themselves. We also\nreport the relative performance of two recent tempo estima-\ntion methods according to a further controlled experiment\nthat does not depend on groundtruth values of any kind.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nNumerous algorithms for estimating the tempo of music di-\nrectly from an audio signal have been developed in recent\nyears, motivated by the obvious value of tempo informa-\ntion to automated tools for use in playlisting and DJ mix-\ning [4]. Automatic estimation of the tempo of a track as\na simple value measured in beats per minute (bpm) is now\nregarded as an established technique. Bpm estimation algo-\nrithms have gained a place in widely-distributed commercial\nhardware mixers for DJs, as well as software applications\nand web service APIs aimed at musicians, recording labels\nand mobile application developers. Meanwhile the annual\nMIREX algorithm evaluation competition offers a more for-\nmal benchmark for the performance of tempo estimation\nsoftware. This has led to the proliferation of rival meth-\nods: seven different algorithms were submitted to the audio\ntempo estimation competition during the past year alone.\nA common observation made in both informal and for-\nmal evaluation of tempo estimation methods is that they fre-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.quently suffer from so-called octave error , where the ma-\nchine estimate is some simple multiple or fraction of the\nperceived tempo [5, 10]. These errors appear to be analo-\ngous to a phenomenon observed in studies of human percep-\ntion of the rhythmic properties of music: humans can also\nsometimes disagree about the frequency of the main beat of\na piece of music. In particular two inÔ¨Çuential experiments\non the perception of tempo attempt to generalise observed\nvariations in human responses into somewhat more formal\nmodels of tempo ambiguity [8, 9].\nThe deÔ¨Ånition of tempo ambiguity proposed in [8] is based\non the authors‚Äô observation that, while users tend to agree on\na bpm value for many tracks, in the remaining cases opinion\nis divided between two candidates. They quantify ambiguity\nas the strength of support for the larger of these two candi-\ndates, divided by their mean support:\nA=2 max( H(T1), H(T2))\nH(T1) +H(T2)(1)\nwhere H(T1)andH(T2)are the number of users who tap at\nT1andT2, the most and second most commonly observed\nbpm values, respectively. The study attempts to model the\ntempo ambiguity of a track in two different ways. Firstly\nthe authors suggest that tempo ambiguity may be related\nto the mean of H(T1)andH(T2); and secondly they in-\nvestigate how a related resonance deviation statistic might\nbe predicted from the value of an acoustic periodicity dif-\nference feature computed from the audio signal. The Ô¨Årst\nmodel was found to be consistent with data collected from\na group of 33 listeners for a set of 24 ten-second excerpts,\nbut the result could not be replicated in a second study of 24\nsubjects who tapped to the beat of 60 thirty-second excerpts.\nThe second model was not supported convincingly by either\nexperiment, although a modiÔ¨Åed formulation of resonance\ndeviation was found to be correlated with periodicity differ-\nence in a third study of 40 subjects [9].\nDespite the inconclusive results reported in [8, 9], the\nstudies have been indirectly inÔ¨Çuential in the research com-\nmunity due to the adoption of their experimental data, and\nof an evaluation methodology based on their observations,\nin recent rounds of the MIREX tempo estimation competi-\ntion. Algorithms entered for the competition have been re-\n317Oral Session 4: Web\nquired to output two different bpm estimates for each track,\ntogether with associated weights intended to represent ‚Äúper-\nceptual strength‚Äù, credit being given for weights similar to\nH(T1)andH(T2), as well as for estimates close to T1and\nT2.\nA separate line of research has, however, highlighted a\nnegative side-effect of putting tempo ambiguity at the heart\nof an evaluation metric for machine estimates. Imagine a\ntrack that has been submitted for automatic tempo estima-\ntion and marked as ‚Äú70bpm or 140bpm‚Äù. Is this track appro-\npriate for a playlist of pieces at walking pace, as suggested\nby an estimate of 70bpm? Is it more suitable for a high en-\nergy playlist, as suggested by 140bpm? Will the track really\nbe perceived as slow by some listeners and as fast by oth-\ners? Or is one of the values simply a poor estimate resulting\nfrom a shortcoming of the algorithm, which would be better\nignored?\nThe authors of [5] go so far as to suggest that such uncer-\ntainty means that machine bpm estimates are simply not us-\nable in practice for many potential applications, and should\nbe abandoned in favour of categorical labels such as slow\nandfast. The study goes on to report extremely high accura-\ncies achieved with a slow-fast classiÔ¨Åer trained on a bag of\nwell-known low level audio features, and using social tags\nas its groundtruth annotations. This suggests that the am-\nbiguity intrinsic to bpm estimation may simply not arise in\nrelation to perceptual tempo categories.\nIn this paper we attempt to reconcile these apparently\nconÔ¨Çicting views of perceptual tempo estimation by crowd-\nsourcing a large set of responses through a web-based exper-\niment. The responses include both tapping data and selec-\ntions from a list of categorical labels. The remainder of the\npaper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we describe the\ndesign of the experiment and give some background about\nweb experiments in general; in Section 3 we report results,\nin particular exploring the relationship between label selec-\ntion and human bpm estimates; in Section 4 we outline how\ncategorical labels might be used to improve bpm estimates\nfrom existing tempo estimation algorithms; in Section 5 we\ndescribe and report the results of a controlled experiment\nto compare different algorithms without reference to any\ngroundtruth values; and in Section 6 we draw conclusions\nand outline future work. Last but not least we provide links\nto our experimental data, making it available for future re-\nsearch and evaluation.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nWhile studies of the perception of music are traditionally\ncarried out under laboratory conditions, in recent years the\nweb has begun to be regarded as a potential source of per-\nceptual data. Social tags, such as those submitted to themusic service Last.fm1, can be seen as an abundant source\nof perceptual responses although their quality is low: the\n‚Äúexperimenter‚Äù has no control whatsoever over the circum-\nstances in which a tag is applied, indeed there is no guar-\nantee that the user of a music tagging system has even lis-\ntened to the music which they are tagging. Social tags have\nnonetheless been used in several studies intended to cap-\nture listeners‚Äô characterizations of perceptual characteristics\nof music [6]. The appeal of tags to researchers is that the\ncost of acquiring them is essentially zero, and they are of-\nten available in sufÔ¨Åcient numbers for statistics to be ro-\nbust even if individual tags are unreliable. Other experi-\nments have been designed as appealing internet games [7].\nThese games give considerably more control over the cir-\ncumstances in which data is collected, but require a rela-\ntively large investment in design and development.\nFor this study we opted for a middle course, designing\nour experiment along the lines of a traditional laboratory\nquestionnaire, but hosting it on the web and simply appeal-\ning to visitors to contribute to our research. Besides pro-\nviding a source of data for the questions at hand, we were\nparticularly interested to Ô¨Ånd out if visitors would take part\nin response to such a bald invitation. This approach, if suc-\ncessful, could offer a useful platform for future research,\noffering considerably more control than social tags, but at\nmuch lower cost than an internet game. The web page for\nthe experiment was hosted on the companion labs site to a\nlarge music website. Although the main site receives many\nmillions of pageviews per day, trafÔ¨Åc to the labs site is sev-\neral orders of magnitude lower, typically a few thousand\npageviews per day.\nOn each view of the experiment, the web page shows\nartist and title information, along with an associated set of\nquestions, for thirty-second excerpts of either one or two\ntracks. The excerpts are chosen at random from a pool of\nseveral thousand audio clips, described in more detail in\nSection 3. The Ô¨Årst excerpt starts playing as soon as the\npage has fully loaded, and the second excerpt starts as soon\nas the Ô¨Årst has Ô¨Ånished. As shown in Figure 1, users are Ô¨Årst\nasked to select a speed label for each track, choosing either\nfrom a 3-point scale from slow tofast, or a visually sepa-\nrate category to report cases where they are not sure. On a\npage displaying two excerpts they are then asked whether\nthe second excerpt sounds slower ,the same speed orfaster\nthan the Ô¨Årst. Finally the visitor is asked to tap along with\nthe main beat of the music.\nThe sequence in which answers can be provided is not\nstrictly locked down, but highlighting on the page is used to\nencourage the visitor to answer the questions in order. In\nparticular the large call to action, shown in Figure 1, is dis-\nplayed only once the preceding question has been answered.\nConventional audio play/pause buttons are provided, so it is\n1e.g.http://www.last.fm/tag/slow\n31812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 1 . Questions asked on the experiment web page.\nalso possible to stop and restart the tracks at will, or to lis-\nten to them more than once. Once tapping begins, the bpm\nmeter is highlighted in red, changing to green once ten taps\nhave been recorded, to give the visitor an idea of when they\nhave tapped for long enough to allow a reasonable estimate\nof bpm to be made. If a visitor resumes tapping after a pause\nof two seconds or more, the bpm meter and its internal coun-\nters are reset and the tapping is considered as a new attempt\nto answer the question. Although not explicitly messaged on\nthe page, this allows users to try again if they are unhappy\nwith their tapping for any particular track. It also imposes\na lower limit of 30bpm on the tempo which the experiment\ncan record. When the visitor presses the Save button, their\nlabel choices for each track are stored, together with a single\nbpm value computed simply as the mean interval between\ntheir taps.\nThe web can reasonably be regarded as a hostile environ-\nment for perceptual experiments when compared to a labo-\nratory setting, but provided the rules of engagement are un-\nderstood in advance then it is possible to design reasonable\nsafeguards into the way in which responses are collected.\nWe restrict access to the experiment to logged-in users of\nthe main website, allowing us to associate responses with\nthe users who have submitted them. To attract users to con-\ntribute more responses, we award points for each question\nanswered and display total scores for top contributors on\na separate leaderboard page, a ploy which unfortunately is\nalso known to encourage cheating. To mitigate the effects\nof cheating we store at most one set of responses per user\nfor each track. Although organised cheating of course re-\nmains possible, it would require a very determined attempt\ngiven the relatively low proÔ¨Åle of the experiment website,\nand spurious data associated with any particular set of users\ncan easily be Ô¨Åltered out of any analysis. In practice we dis-\ncarded only tapping estimates of over 300bpm, which most\nlikely correspond to misunderstanding of the interface.\nWith these considerations in mind, however, we do en-Listeners Tracks Responses\nLabels 2141 4006 21444\nBpm estimates 1919 3929 19451\nComparisons 1438 3825 7597\nTable 1 .

This is discussed more\nfully in Section 5 below.\n3. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS\nThe experiment continues to be publicly available at\nhttp://playground.last.fm/demo/speedo .\nTable 1 summarises the number of responses received at the\ntime of writing. The tracks presented on any given view of\nthe experiment web page are chosen essentially at random,\nas described in detail in Section 5, and consequently the dis-\ntribution of responses between tracks is not uniform. Most\nof the following analysis concentrates on tracks which were\nannotated by at least Ô¨Åve listeners: in particular 1437 tracks\nreceived Ô¨Åve or more speed labels, while 1263 of those re-\nceived at least Ô¨Åve bpm estimates.\nThe annotated tracks are predominantly rock, country,\npop, soul, funk and rnb, jazz, latin, reggae, disco and rap,\nbut also include music from numerous other genres, includ-\ning punk, electronic, trance, industrial, house and folk. They\nrange from recent releases back to the 1960s. A full list of\ntracks used in the experiment is available (see Section 6).\n3.1 Ambiguity in perceptual tempo labels\nAs described in Section 2, visitors to the experiment were\nasked both to tap along to each excerpt and to describe its\n319Oral Session 4: Web\nFigure 2 .

Observed distribution of conÔ¨Çict coefÔ¨Åcient C.\nspeed on a three-point scale of slow, medium and fast, or\nto indicate if they found it hard to decide. Figure 2 shows\ndistributions of all bpm estimates computed from tapping,\nfor tracks annotated by at least Ô¨Åve people of whom a ma-\njority described them as slow or fast respectively. Figure 3\nshows the corresponding distributions of single peak bpm\nestimates for each track, computed as follows. Individual\nlisteners‚Äô estimates are histogrammed into ten bins; the peak\nestimate is then the median value in the most populated bin.\nIf adjacent bins contain the same number of values they are\nmerged into a single bin before taking the median.\nThe shape of the distributions in Figure 2 suggests that\nwe can be speciÔ¨Åc about octave disagreement in human tap-\nping: when listening to tracks generally regarded as fast,\nsome listeners tap half as fast as the majority. Figure 4\nshows the distribution of labels supplied for these tracks by\n‚Äúslow tappers‚Äù: there are cases in which they consider the\nmusic to be slow, but they are rare.\nTo model the extent of disagreement over perceptual slow\nand fast categories, by analogy with (1) we deÔ¨Åne the con-\nÔ¨Çict coefÔ¨Åcient for a track:\nC=min(Ls, Lf)\nmax(Ls, Lf)¬∑Ls+Lf\nL(2)\nwhere Lis the total number of labels supplied, of which Ls\nare slow and Lfare fast. The Ô¨Årst term represents the ex-\ntent to which fast and slow labels conÔ¨Çict, while the second\nterm applies a discount to this if other users have labelled\nthe excerpt as medium. Figure 5 gives the distribution of C\nover all tracks with at least Ô¨Åve labels, showing that, for the\nhuge majority of tracks, listeners do not disagree at all when\ndescribing excerpts as either slow or fast. To test whether\nlisteners disagree over perceptual categories in the face of\ntempo ambiguity, we deÔ¨Åne ambiguous tracks to be those\nfor which more than 30% of listeners tap at either double\nor half the peak bpm estimate, allowing a 4% margin of er-\n32012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nror when comparing bpm values. The mean conÔ¨Çict coefÔ¨Å-\ncient for ambiguous tracks is 0.062, slightly higher than the\nmean of 0.058 for the remaining unambiguous tracks, but\nthe difference is not signiÔ¨Åcant ( p= 0.647). We conclude\nthat in general there is no evidence that listeners disagree\nover which excerpts sound slow, and which sound fast, even\nwhen they tap at different metrical levels.\n3.2 Evaluating machine bpm estimates\nIn order to demonstrate the potential value of crowd-sourced\nannotations in evaluating tempo estimation algorithms, we\nselected excerpts for the experiment for which bpm esti-\nmates were readily available from several sources. We re-\nport results here for the following three sources: estimates\nfrom the commercial EchoNest API, as distributed with the\nMillion Song Dataset [1]; the BPM List, a published list of\nbpm values claimed to be computed at least partly by hand,\nusing a variety of commercially-available tools [2]; and, Ô¨Å-\nnally, estimates generated using an implementation of meth-\nods reported in [3] and distributed as a plugin for the V AMP\nframework for audio analysis2.\nSome selection of values was necessary for the EchoNest\nand V AMP sources. The Million Song Dataset was found in\na number of cases to contain data for different versions of\nthe same song: we rejected any songs for which the dupli-\ncate tempo estimates differed by more than 2%, and other-\nwise simply used the Ô¨Åst value encountered. The V AMP plu-\ngin is designed to produce multiple segment-wise tempo es-\ntimates: we selected the estimate associated with the longest\nsegment(s) of audio.\nTable 2 shows evaluation results for the three sources rel-\native to peak human estimates. The evaluation is restricted\nto tracks for which at least Ô¨Åve crowd-sourced bpm values\nwere available. In order to observe systematic types of error\nin the sources, estimates not matching the human reference\nvalues are split between six categories, corresponding to six\ntypes of octave error, and a Ô¨Ånal ‚Äòunrelated‚Äô category for es-\ntimates that do not match any of the preceding ones. An\nestimate is considered to match the groundtruth bpm, or one\nof its related values, if it differs by less than 4% of the ref-\nerence3.\nThe results given in Table 2 show signiÔ¨Åcant differences\nin the performance of the three sources: the strongest source,\nthe BPM List, is correct some 70% more often than the\nweakest, the EchoNest. The BPM List also suffers the least\nfrom octave error, presumably conÔ¨Årming that humans were\ninvolved in the creation of its estimates. While categorised\nresults like Table 2 are useful to understand the strengths\nand weaknesses of particular methods, a robust single per-\nformance value can also easily be computed as a weighted\n2http://www.vamp-plugins.org\n3The MIREX 2010 evaluation allows a relative error of 8%.Ô¨Årst faster same second faster\nEchoNest 39.2 27.3 33.4\nBpm List 33.9 34.7 31.4\nV AMP 34.0 34.0 32.0\nTable 4 .

The weights can be tuned to reÔ¨Çect\nthe potential harm caused by octave errors for any particular\napplication.\n4. IMPROVING AUTOMATIC BPM ESTIMATES\nResults presented in [5] report that classiÔ¨Åers can be trained\nto recognise tracks belonging to perceptual slow and fast\ncategories with extremely high accuracy. The separable dis-\ntributions shown in Figure 3 suggest that we can use the out-\nput of such classiÔ¨Åers to remove a great deal of octave error\nin machine estimates. The following simple algorithm can\nbe used to adjust bpm estimates in cases where they conÔ¨Çict\nwith predicted labels: any estimate of over 100bpm for a\ntrack classiÔ¨Åed as slow should be halved, and vice versa for\nfast tracks. While evaluating this approach directly remains\nfor future work, Table 3 illustrates the substantial gains pos-\nsible in the best case, by assuming a classiÔ¨Åer that always\npredicts the label chosen by the majority of humans in the\nexperiment.\n5. COMPARING ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS\nIn addition to allowing data collection for conventional eval-\nuation against a groundtruth, the experiment was designed\nto contain a controlled experiment enabling the comparison\nof different sources of bpm estimates without reference to\nany groundtruth. The experiment holds indexes from the\nbpm estimates of each source, rounded to the nearest inte-\nger, to a list of all tracks for which the source gave that es-\ntimate. When a visitor arrives at the experiment web page,\nthe server Ô¨Årst chooses a source at random. It then chooses\na rounded bpm value, and Ô¨Ånally selects two correspond-\ning tracks from the index (or a single track, if the source\nonly annotated one track in the collection with that partic-\nular value). This ensures not only that visitors are asked to\nannotate tracks with a wide range of likely tempo, but in par-\nticular that any two tracks presented together are regarded\nby at least one of the sources as having the same tempo.\nSources can then be compared for consistency by exam-\nining responses to the second question shown in Figure 1,\nin which listeners are asked to say which of the two tracks\nsounds faster. This is clearly a leading question, likely to\n321Oral Session 4: Web\nbpm * 4 bpm * 3 bpm * 2 correct bpm / 2 bpm / 3 bpm / 4 unrelated\nEchoNest 0.6 1.7 30.5 40.7 2.4 0.0 0.1 24.0\nBpm List 0.0 0.2 8.2 68.1 5.2 0.1 0.0 18.3\nV AMP 0.7 1.6 23.0 58.3 4.0 1.6 0.0 12.3\nTable 2 .

Al-\nthough we cannot know in advance what proportion of lis-\nteners will choose each option, we can safely assume that,\nall things being equal, the proportion will be independent of\nthe source of the bpm estimates.\nAs the results given in Table 4 illustrate, this method is\nsuccessful in highlighting differences between the sources,\nwith the EchoNest estimates again shown to be signiÔ¨Åcantly\nless consistent than either other source.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThis study shows how, with a suitable experiment, simple\ncrowd sourcing of annotations can be used to evaluate al-\ngorithms such as bpm estimation. Analysis of tens of thou-\nsands of responses collected within just a few days leads\nto the proposal of a straightforward and robust approach to\nevaluation against a human groundtruth, which is both con-\nsonant with perceptions of tempo, and designed to reward\nthe estimates most likely to be useful in practical applica-\ntions. A second controlled experiment allows validation\nof these results without reference to any groundtruth val-\nues. Finally we outline a method to combine classiÔ¨Åcation\nwith conventional tempo estimation, which promises signif-\nicant improvements over current methods. Future work in-\ncludes implementing and evaluating this approach, and ex-\ntending crowd sourcing to evaluate a wider range of MIR\nalgorithms. Data collected for this study is freely available\nfor research purposes4.\n4http://users.last.fm/ Àúmark/speedo.tgz7. REFERENCES\n[1] Thierry Bertin-Mahieux, Daniel P.W.

INTRODUCTION\nIn classical music, music pieces are usually conceived by\ncomposersandtranslatedintoscores.

Withanincreasingnumberofsuchper-\nformances becoming available in digital form, we also gain\naccess tomany different artisticreadings of musicpieces.\nThe availability of recordings of multiple performances\nof music pieces previously has strongly been exploited in\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this noticeand thefull citation ontheÔ¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011International Society forMusic InformationRetrieval .theÔ¨Åeldofaudiosimilarity-basedretrieval. Inthis,thef ocus\nwasonmatchingmusicallycloselyrelatedfragments( audio\nmatching [6,8]),orÔ¨Åndingdifferentversionsofasongatthe\ndocument level, ranging from different performances of the\nsame notated score ( opus retrieval [2]) to potentially radi-\ncallydifferentnewrenditionsofapreviouslyrecordedson g\n(cover song identiÔ¨Åcation [11]). In general, matching and\nretrieval of classical music pieces were shown to be achiev-\nable with near-perfect results [1,4]. Another category of\nprevious work largely focused on analyzing and/or visual-\nizing the playing characteristics of individual performer s in\ncomparison toother performers [3,9,10].\nAt certain moments, a performer will display larger per-\nsonal expressive freedom than at other moments, guided by\ntheoretical and stylistic musical domain knowledge as well\nas personal taste and emotion. By comparing expressive\nmanifestations in multiple recordings of the same piece, we\ntherefore can gain insight in places in the piece where the\nnotated musical content invites performers to display more\nor less expressive individualism. Such information on the\ninterplay between performance aspects and the notated mu-\nsicalcontentprovidesanovelperspectiveontheimpliciti n-\nterpretative aspects of the content, which can be of a direct\nbeneÔ¨Åt for many Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks,\nranging from music-historical performance school analysi s\ntoquickandinformeddifferentiatingandpreviewingofmul -\ntiplerecordings of the samepiece inlarge databases.\nIn recent previous work [5], we proposed a light-weight,\nunsupervisedandaudio-basedmethodtostudytimingdevi-\nations among different performances. The results of a qual-\nitative study obtained for 5 Chopin mazurkas showed that\ntiming individualism as inferred by our method can be re-\nlated to the structure of a music piece, and even highlight\ninterpretational aspects of a piece that are not necessaril y\nvisible from the musical score. In this paper, we introduce\nan entropy-based approach as an alternative to our previous\nstandard deviation-based approach, and will study the char -\nacteristics of both methods in more depth at multiple short-\ntime window resolutions. While this task does not have a\nclear-cut ground truth, the introduction of our new entropy\nmethod allows for quantitative comparative analyses, pro-\nvidingdeeperandmoregeneralizableinsightintoourmeth-\n519Poster Session 4\nodsthanthelargelyqualitativepioneeringanalysesfrom[ 5].\nThis paper is organized as follows. After a summary\nof our previous work from [5], we will describe our new\nentropy-based method. This will be followed by a descrip-\ntionoftheexperimentalsetupandcorrespondingresults. F i-\nnally,thepaperwillendwithaconclusionanddiscussionof\nfuturedirections.\n2. AUDIO-BASED ALIGNMENT AND ANALYSIS\nOFMULTIPLE PERFORMANCES\n2.1 Audio-based alignment of multipleperformances\nIn [5], we proposed a method to infer timing expressivity\nin an audio-based, objective and unsupervised data-driven\nway, largely building on novel work in audio similarity-\nbased retrieval.\nAs short-time harmonic audio signal descriptor features,\nwe adopt the recent Chroma Discrete Cosine Transform-\nreduced Log Pitch (CRP) features, which outperformed tra-\nditionalchromarepresentationsintimbre-robustnessand au-\ndio matching performance [7]. We use the CRP feature im-\nplementation as made available by the original authors1. If\nAis a set with naudio recordings of the same piece, we\nobtainnCRP proÔ¨Åle vectors restablishing a set R, where\neachrrepresents an audio recording a‚ààA.\nAs different performances of the same piece may differ\nin global tempo, the CRP proÔ¨Åle vectors r‚ààRwill have\ndifferent lengths. Through Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\ntechniques, we can align the vectors and Ô¨Ånd a time map-\nping between corresponding events in different recordings .\nForthis,weapplytheDTWalignmenttechniquefrom[11],\nwhich used a binary cost measure and imposed local con-\nstraints to avoid pathological warpings. This method was\nshown to be very powerful in cover song retrieval settings.\nWe choose a CRP proÔ¨Åle vector rref‚ààR, correspond-\ning to a reference recording that may be arbitrary chosen.\nBy aligning rrefwith the vectors r‚ààR\\{rref}, corre-\nsponding to all other recordings in the set, full alignment\nbetween performances is achieved through rref. For each\nalignment between rrefand anr‚ààR, an alignment ma-\ntrixXis constructed. The alignment value Xi,jbetween\ntwoCRPproÔ¨Åles attimeinstances iandjinrrefandr, re-\nspectively ( rref[i]andr[j]), is computed adopting the local\nconstraints as suggested in [11]. Initialization procedur es,\nbinary similarity measures and other parameters were also\ntaken from this article, to which the interested reader is re -\nferredfor moredetails.\nAn explicit alignment path is obtained by tracing back\nfrom the point corresponding to the highest total alignment\nscore. If|rref|=m, for each alignment toa performance r\nweobtainanalignmentpath woflength m,withw[1...m]\n1http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mmueller/\nchromatoolbox/indicatingshort-timeinstanceindicesoftheCRPproÔ¨Ålesi n\nrthat align to rref[1...m]. Not all time instances 1...m\nmayhavebeenexplicitelycoveredintheoriginalalignment\npath. Assuming linear development for unknown instances,\nmissingvalues areestimated through linear interpolation .\n2.2 Performance alignment analysis\nAfter calculating all alignment paths following the proce-\nduresabove,wewillhaveobtainedaset Wwithn‚àí1align-\nment paths w‚ààW, each of length m. We post-process\nthesepathstoemphasizeirregularalignmentbehavior: ifa n\nalignmentsubpath w[k...l]showsconstantalignmentsteps\n(w[k] =w[k+ 1] =w[k+ 2] =¬∑¬∑¬∑=w[l‚àí1] =w[l]),\nthis means that the corresponding CRP feature vector ex-\ncerpt inris a linearly scaled version of rref[k...l], and\ntherefore does not reÔ¨Çect any timing individualism. In or-\nder to highlight alignment step slope changes, we compute\ndiscrete second derivatives over the alignment path.\nFirst of all, for each alignment path w, we compute the\ndiscrete Ô¨Årstderivative Œ¥through thecentral difference:\nŒ¥[i] =Ô£±\nÔ£¥Ô£≤\nÔ£¥Ô£≥1\n2(w[i+1]‚àíw[i‚àí1]) 1‚â§i‚â§m\nw[1]‚àíw[0] i= 1\nw[m]‚àíw[m‚àí1] i=m.\nDue to an initial alignment index jump, a large ‚Äòstartup‚Äô\nderivative is found at the beginning of the path. As we are\nonlyinterestedinthealignmentstepdevelopmentwithinth e\ntrue alignment path (and the beginning of the recording for\nthegiventimesamplingratewillcontainsilence),wesetth e\nderivative values up to this startup point to 0. By repeating\nthecentraldifferenceprocedureontheenhanced Œ¥,asecond\nderivative approximation Œ¥2‚àà‚àÜ2isobtained.\nWeassumethatmomentsinthepieceshowingthelargest\ntiming deviations among performers (and thus, the highest\ndegree of individualism) must have given the performers a\nreason to do so, and therefore must be of a certain semantic\nrelevance. A measure is needed to express this individual-\nity of timing at all short-time instances of ‚àÜ2. For this, we\nproposed to adopt the standard deviation: for each time in-\nstancet= 1...m, we compute œÉ[t], which is the standard\ndeviation of all alignment second derivatives Œ¥2[t]‚àà‚àÜ2,\nacquiring astandard deviation sequence œÉof length m.\n3. ENTROPY AS INFORMATION MEASURE\nTheassumptionthatmomentswiththelargesttimingdevia-\ntions(‚Äòdisagreement‚Äô)amongperformerswillbeofacertai n\nsemanticrelevanceresemblesthenotionofentropyininfor -\nmation theory, where items with the most uncertain actual\nrealization are considered to hold the largest amount of in-\nformation. Thus, as an alternative to our previous standard\n52012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndeviation method, we now propose to calculate the entropy\nof‚àÜ2at each short-time instance. If ‚àÜ2has the possible\nvalues (‚Äòsymbols‚Äô) d2\nt,1...d2\nt,fat timet,then\nh[t] =‚àíf/summationdisplay\ni=1p(d2\nt,i)log2p(d2\nt,i)\nwhereweapproximate p(d2\nt,i)bythefrequencyof d2\nt,iin‚àÜ2\nat time instance t. While the previous standard deviation-\nbased approach treats the values at each Œ¥2[t]as cardinal\ndata, the entropy-based approach will treat the values as\nnominal data, only measuring diversity.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nWe initially conceived our methods with the goal to reveal\nimplicitly encoded expressive musical information in au-\ndio that would go beyond an objective score reading. This\nmeans that no explicit classiÔ¨Åcation is applied and an ob-\njective ground truth is absent. Because of this, in [5], the\nresults of the standard deviation-based method were largel y\ndiscussed in a qualititative way. With our new entropy-\nbased method, possibilities arise for quantitative compar -\nisonsbetweenthismethodandthestandarddeviation-based\nmethod, which we will discuss in this section, as an addi-\ntion to qualitative and musical interpretations of the resu lts\nof theentropy-based method.\nOurexperimentswillfocusontwoaspects: (1)verifying\nthatœÉandharenorandomnoisesequencesand(2)focusing\nonthemainsimilaritiesanddissimilaritiesbetween œÉandh\nfrom a quantitative and qualitative perspective. While the\nwork in [5] only focused on a 2048-sample short-time au-\ndio analysis window, our current experiments will consider\nmultiplepossiblewindowlengths. Whilewearenotstriving\nto identify an ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô time window length yet (which will\ndependonthedesiredmusicalunitresolution,e.g. smallor -\nnamental notes vs. harmonies on beats), we consider these\nmultiple window lengths to verify if the behavior of our\nmethods is stable enough to not only yield interpretable re-\nsultsat theearlier studied resolution of2048 samples.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nFollowingourearlierwork,wefocuson5Chopinmazurkas\nthat were thoroughly annotated as part of the CHARM Ma-\nzurkaProject[9]: op.17no.4,op.24no.2,op.30no.2,op.\n63 no. 3 and op. 68 no. 3, with 94, 65, 60, 88 and 51 avail-\nable recordings, respectively.

Nexttotheexample\nin Figure 3, where both the œÉandhvalues increased with\nornamentational variation, we also give an example where\nthe musical score does not clearly indicate the expressive\ndevelopment of phrases. In Figure 4, the ‚Äòc‚Äô section of ma-\nzurka op. 30 no. 2 is shown, where a simple subphrase is\nalmost identically repeated 8 times. A performer will not\nplay this subphrase 8 times in an identical way, and this is\nreÔ¨Çectedbothin œÉandh: themajordisplaysofindividuality\nin recordings can be found in subphrases 1 (Ô¨Årst statement\nof subphrase), 3 (following traditional binary period stru c-\ntures, here a new subphrase could be starting, but this is not\nthe case) and 8 (last statement of subphrase). Furthermore,\nFigure 3.œÉ(top) and h(bottom) sequence for opening\nphrase of mazurka op. 17 no. 4 with corresponding score\nfragments. 1024-sample window length, 20-point moving\naverage smoothed trendline indicated withthick line.\nforsubphrase4and8,theaveragevalueof œÉandhishigher\nthan in the other subphrases, and no minima are reached\nas large as in the other phrases. This can be explained be-\ncauseofthealteredornamentstartingthesubphrase,andth e\nfact that both subphrase 4 and 8 are the Ô¨Ånal subphrase in a\nhigher-order phrase hierarchy of 4 + 4 subphrases. From\nboth Figure 3 and 4, the main difference between œÉandh\nappears to be that hhas a considerably larger range than œÉ,\nand especially tends toamplify positive peaks.\nWithitslessnoisybehaviorandstrongerpeakampliÔ¨Åca-\ntion, the entropy-based method seems more attractive for\nour alignment analyses than the standard deviation-based\nmethod. As a Ô¨Ånal experiment aimed at gaining more in-\nsightintothedifferencesbetweenbothmethods,welinearl y\nscale both œÉandhto unit range. This results in sequences\nœÉnormandhnorm.

While these cases consider a decreasing number of\nevents, the musical importance of the events increases: a\nsubphrase start should be more informative than a random\ninstance intime.

Our entropy method yielded results that con-\nsistently were strongly correlated with the standard devia -\ntion results at multiple time resolutions, while being less\nnoisy and amplifying positive peaks, which both are desir-\nable properties for our purposes. It was shown that both the\nstandard deviation and entropy methods do not depict ran-\ndom noise, but can be relatedtoactual musical content.\nThedevelopmentovermultipletimeresolutionsofcorre-\nlations between standard deviation and entropy sequences,\nthe frequencies of up- and downward runs, as well as runs\n523Poster Session 4\n(a)Score with numberedsubphrases\n(b)Standarddeviationsequence œÉ\n(c)Entropysequence h\nFigure4.

INTRODUCTION\nThere are a number of digital music notation formats, such\nas Music XML, the MIDI Ô¨Åle format, and various formats\nfor images of scanned sheet music. However it is tabs, which\nare plain text Ô¨Åles containing tablature and/or chord symbols\nand lyrics, that have become the most commonly used mu-\nsic notation format on the internet. A comparison of the\nmost popular MIDI, sheet music and tab websites‚Äô unique\nvisitors per month can be seen in Table 1. The popularity of\ntabs is due to a simple, intuitive approach to the instructions\nthat requires no formal training to understand nor speciÔ¨Åc\nsoftware to read or write. Added to this is the fact that tabs\nare commonly free to use and the amount of data needed to\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.File type Most popular site Visitors\ntabs ultimate-guitar.com 2,541,482\nsheet music 8notes.com 470,010\nMIDI freemidi.org 17,437\nTable 1 .Unique visitors per month to music score websites from\nhttp://siteanalytics.compete.com\ntransfer the text instructions is almost negligible. However,\ndue to the lack of standardisation there are many variations\nin how they are structured, making machine parsing of tabs\ndifÔ¨Åcult. Also, since even beginners can use the format to\nannotate music, many of the tabs found are of poor quality,\nsuffering from errors and incompleteness. A further prob-\nlem is that multiple tabs exist for many songs, making it dif-\nÔ¨Åcult for the user to locate the most accurate and complete\ninstance among the alternatives. These difÔ¨Åculties motivate\nthe current work.\nWe address these problems by developing a parser for\nguitar tabs and using music information retrieval methods to\nanalyse and compare the tabs. We propose several features\nand evaluate their effectiveness as predictors of tab accuracy,\nin order to improve the quality of tab retrieval. Overall, we\naim to evaluate the viability of data-mining a noisy source\nof metadata from the internet, and we compare our results\nwith those obtained by content-based analysis of audio for\ndetermining the chord sequence for a given song.\nDespite the popularity of tabs on Usenet groups such as\nalt.guitar.tab in the 1990‚Äôs and more recently on web sites\nsuch as ultimate-guitar.com, little attention has been given to\nthis source of data by the music information retrieval com-\nmunity. In recent work McVicar and De Bie [8, 9] showed\nhow chord sequences from guitar tabs, synchronised with\nthe music, can help improve machine learning methods for\nchord recognition. Audio and video analysis were used in\n[3] to Ô¨Ånd the simplest tablature transcription of chords and\na guitar tablature score follower was demonstrated in [5] that\nused score following to display tabs on small screens.\n2. THE BEATLES DATA\nIn this work we focus on The Beatles due to the availability\nof ample annotated data and guitar tabs for this band.\n453Poster Session 3\n2.1 Ground Truth Chord Sequences\nThe ground truth chord sequence annotations for The Bea-\ntles used in this work come from transcriptions by Chris\nHarte [2]. This data includes chord sequences for 180 tracks\nfrom 12 Beatles‚Äô studio albums, which is the set that we fo-\ncus on in our evaluation.\n2.2 Ground Truth Structure Segmentation\nThese are structural segmentations consisting of start time,\nend time and segment label for the same 180 The Beat-\nles tracks [6]. The labels are words such as verse, refrain,\nbridge, intro, outro, andsilence , which are often qualiÔ¨Åed\nwith details, e.g. verse a, verse b,andverse (guitar solo) .\n2.3 Web-Mining\nWe used two search engines to locate guitar tabs. The Ô¨Årst,\n911tabs.com, is a guitar tab search engine with over 4.5 mil-\nlion tabs indexed. We wrote a web crawler that retrieved all\nthe correctly labelled Beatles tabs from 911tabs.com corre-\nsponding to the 180 tracks in our test set. For the second\nsearch engine, Google, we found a combination of search\nterms (‚Äòguitar‚Äô, ‚Äòtab‚Äô and some Ô¨Ålters for unwanted content\nsuch as ‚Äò-video‚Äô) that, when combined with the artist and\ntrack name, gave a high ratio of tabs in the results. After\nthe Ô¨Årst 100 results for each tab search, the number of tabs\nreturned was low, so we focused on the top 100 results for\neach song. In total we found 24746 tabs relating to the 180\nBeatles tracks in our ground truth data. Additionally, we\nmined the web for an initial chord dictionary of 264 com-\nmon chords from chordie.com and guitarsite.com.\n3. TAB PARSING\nWe see decoding tabs as an example of noisy text analytics,\nwhich are often applied to determine meaning from web-\nmined resources such as online chat, forums, blogs and wikis.\nTo interpret the noisy semi-structured tab data, we imple-\nmented a large set of simple heuristics to handle the many\nvaried tab writing styles that exist. The following steps are\na brief outline of the stages involved in parsing tabs.\n‚Ä¢Interpret any HyperText Markup Language (HTML)\nspeciÔ¨Åc tags. For instance, &nbsp; and <br>tags are\nchanged to spaces and new lines, respectively.\n‚Ä¢Analyse each line to determine what (if any) type of\ntab line it is. For example the line could contain a\n‚Äòstructural marker‚Äô, ‚Äòchord line‚Äô, ‚Äòchord and lyrics line‚Äô,\n‚Äòtablature line‚Äô, etc. Non-tab-speciÔ¨Åc text is discarded.\n‚Ä¢For each tab line, decode the tab elements accord-\ningly. As such, chords will be extracted from any\n‚Äòchord line‚Äô or ‚Äòchord and lyrics line‚Äô, notes will be[Intro]\nRiff1\ne------0-|-3---3---5---5-|-10-------------------|------8---------|\nB---3--1-|-3---3---7---7-|-12----12-0--0--12-0--|------10--10--7-|\nG--------|-4---4---7---7-|-12----12-12-12-12-12-|-9----9---------|\nD--------|---------------|----------12-12-12-12-|-10-------------|\nA--------|---------------|----------------------|(10)------------|\nE--------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|\nRiff2\ne--3--3--3--3--|--0--0------(0)-|\nB--3--3--3--3--|--3--3--(3)-----|\nG--0--0--2--2--|--0--0----------|\nD--0--0--0--0--|--2--2---0---2--|\nA--2--2--x--x--|--2--2----------|\nE--3--3--2--2--|--0--0----------|\nG D/F# Em\nG D/F# Em\nLove love love\nG D/F# Em\nLove love love\nD7/A G D7/F# D7/E\nLove love love\nD C Riff3\nFigure 1 .Tab Sample 1.

Any indica-\ntors of repetitions will be expanded so that ‚Äòx2‚Äô will\nresult in the current section being duplicated.\nWe developed our heuristics for parsing guitar tabs on\na set of 20 tabs for which we manually annotated ground\ntruth. The chord retrieval from these tabs, as an example,\nextracts 806 out of the 807 chords correctly. Figures 1 -\n2 demonstrates two different samples of tab formats along\nwith the chords extracted by our parsing tool in each case.\n4. EVALUATION\nIn this section we evaluate the precision of the tabs them-\nselves and then compare various means of ranking the tabs.\nIn order to do this, we Ô¨Årst describe the features used for\nmeasuring and predicting the tabs‚Äô accuracies. We also ex-\nplain existing ranking methods, such as 911.com‚Äôs user rat-\ning and Google‚Äôs page rank. We then use correlation to\ndetermine the suitability of using these features as ranking\nmethods. Also, for each feature, we compare the selected\nchord sequences with the output of a state-of-the-art auto-\nmatic chord detection system.\n45412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nC# C#6 Db Fm7 C/B A11 Dm/C#\nC# 0.0 0.25 0.0 0.5 1.0 0.8 0.75\nTable 2 .Chord Similarity (CS) cost examples.\n4.1 Features\n4.1.1 Chord Similarity (CS)\nIn order to measure two chords‚Äô similarity, we use the Lev-\nenshtein Distance (LD) [4] of the alphabetically ordered notes\nin the chord, as interpreted from the chord deÔ¨Ånitions. The\nLD uses dynamic programming to Ô¨Ånd a path P(U, V) =\n(p1, p2, ..., p W)through a matrix of costs between sequences\nU= (u1, u2, ..., u M)andV= (v1, v2, ..., v N). This cost\nmatrix is described as dU,V(m, n)where m‚àà[1 :M]and\nn‚àà[1 :N]where each pk= (mk, nk). LD uses a cost of\n0for matches and 1for any insertion, deletion or alteration.\nThe maximum cost is the length of the longest sequence.\nWe normalise and invert this cost to give a similarity value\nfrom 0to1, between two chords (note sequences), UandV.\nCS(U,V) =/parenleftbigg\n1‚àíLD(U, V)\nmax(M, N )/parenrightbigg\n(1)\nDue to how tab parser interprets chord deÔ¨Ånitions, this\ncost function treats any enharmonic chords or notes equally.\nExamples of this cost function (CS) can be seen in Table 2.\n4.1.2 Chord Sequence Similarity (CSS)\nThe Chord Sequence Similarity is a measure of how similar\ntwo tab chord sequences, T1andT2are. For this method\nwe use DTW, a generalisation of LD, which has been used\nfor synchronisation in applications such as score following\n[1]. Unlike the binary comparison in LD, DTW can use a\nmore detailed cost function such as the inner product of the\npair of feature vectors, which returns a value between 0and\n1for each pair of feature vectors. In our case the DTW\nuses the CS cost function to compare chords. The overall\nsimilarity cost is given by the sum of the individual chord\nmatch costs along the DTW path Pand the maximum cost\nis the length of the longest sequence. We normalise and\ninvert this similarity cost and express it as a percentage:\nCSS(T1,T2)=/parenleftbigg\n1‚àíDTW (T1, T2, CS)\nmax(|T1|,|T2|)/parenrightbigg\n√ó100 (2)\nExamples of the CSS can be seen in Table 5.\n4.1.3 Chord Accuracy (CA)\nThe Chord Accuracy measures the similarity of the overall\nsequence of chords Tin a tab to the chord sequence Gin\nthe ground truth data for the song. Transpositions are not\nconsidered in this factor.\nCA(T, G) =CSS(T, G) (3)4.1.4 Segment Chord Accuracy (SCA)\nMany tabs have incomplete chord sequences, and rely on\nthe user to piece together the complete tab based on cues,\nintuition and knowledge of the song. A more Ô¨Çexible ac-\ncuracy measurement, the Segment Chord Accuracy, Ô¨Ånds\nthe accuracy of each segment in the tab independently. For\neach structural segment of a song, as deÔ¨Åned in our struc-\ntural ground truth data, the SCA takes the closest matching\nsub-sequence from the tab‚Äôs overall chord sequence. In ad-\ndition, chord sub-sequences which match to more than one\nsegment may be reused and transpositions of the data are\nallowed in the SCA measurement. The pseudo-code for the\nSCA is shown in Algorithm 1.\nInput :Segmentation S={s1, s2, ..., s l},Ground Truth\nChords G,Tab Chords T\nOutput :Segment Chord Accuracy SCA\nSCA = length(G) ;\nforTransposition Tr = 0to11do\nTranspositionCost = 0;\nfori =1toldo\nSegCost = length( si);\nforstart = 0 to length(T) do\nforlen = 1 to length(T) ‚àístart do\nT/prime= subsequence(T,start,len)\nifCSS(si,T/prime)<SegCost then\nSegCost = CSS( si, transpose( T/prime, Tr)) ;\nend\nend\nend\nTranspositionCost += SegCost ;\nend\nifTranspositionCost <SCAthen\nSCA = TranspositionCost;\nend\nend\nreturn SCA;\nAlgorithm 1 : Segment Chord Accuracy\n4.1.5 Chords Concurrence (CC)\nTo determine how well tabs of a song agree with each other,\nwe deÔ¨Åne the Chords Concurrence as the average of the sim-\nilarities between a tab‚Äôs chord sequence Tkand the chord\nsequences Ti(i/negationslash=k)of all the other tabs of the same song.\nCC(Tk) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1,i /negationslash=kCSS(Tk, Ti)/(n‚àí1) (4)\n4.1.6 Structure Similarity (SS)\nIn order to calculate Structure Similarity we Ô¨Årst normalise\nthe labelling of structural segments, so that a musical struc-\nture such as (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse,...) is represented\nby the sequence of characters (A, B, C, B, ...). We then use\nthe LD, normalised and inverted to provide a percentage:\nSS(T1, T2) =/parenleftbigg\n1‚àíLD(T1, T2)\nmax(T1, T2)/parenrightbigg\n√ó100 (5)\nNote that we only compute Structure Similarity where\nthe structure is explicitly given in the tab.\n455Poster Session 3\n4.1.7 Structure Accuracy (SA)\nThe Structure Accuracy is a measure of how similar the\nstructural sequence Tof a tab is to the structural sequence\nGof the ground truth data.\nSA(T) =SS(T, G) (6)\n4.1.8 Structure Concurrence (SC)\nThe Structure Concurrence is the average of the similarities\nbetween a tab‚Äôs structural sequence Tkand the structural se-\nquences Tiof all the other tabs of the same song.\nSC(Tk) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1,i /negationslash=kSS(Tk, Ti)/(n‚àí1) (7)\n4.1.9 911 Rating\nThe 911 Rating is the average user rating assigned to the tab\nat www.911tabs.com from 1 (bad) to 5 (good). The number\nof votes that went into this average rating is not provided by\nthe tab site. 1246 tabs with chords had 911 Ratings.\n4.1.10 Google Rank\nThe tab‚Äôs Google Rank corresponds to where the URL of the\ntab is found in the ordered list of Google‚Äôs ranked search re-\nsults [10]. Values range from 1 (best) to 100 (worst known).\n5619 tabs found had Google Ranks associated with them,\n1931 of which had chord sequences.\n4.1.11 Date ModiÔ¨Åed\nIf posted tabs are edited and reposted, it might be the case\nthat more recent tabs are more accurate on average than ear-\nlier tabs. A tab‚Äôs Date ModiÔ¨Åed is the last modiÔ¨Åed value\nof the HTML Ô¨Åle on the tab server, expressed as the number\nof milliseconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT. 2022\nof the tabs with chord sequences had an associated last date\nmodiÔ¨Åed.\n4.2 Guitar Tab Statistics\nOf the 24746 tabs found with our web-mining tool, 7547 had\nrecognisable chord content and 4643 had structure explicitly\ndeÔ¨Åned, with at least 3 chords/sections. The average tab\nChord Accuracy (CA) for tabs, tabs that were duplicates and\nnon duplicates is 61.8%, 63.4%, and 58.3% respectively. A\nsimilar pattern was observed in the Structure Accuracy (SA)\nof 50.0%, 50.3%, and 49.1%, suggesting that more accurate\ntabs are more likely to be copied. The accuracy difference\nis however small, and the Pearson-rank correlation shows a\nvery weak correlation between accuracy and whether a tab\nis duplicated (0.12 for CA and 0.03 for SA).Filter Method Pearson-rank correlation Samples\nCA SCA\nChords Concurrence 0.54 0.51 7547\n911 Rating 0.07 0.06 1161\nGoogle Rank -0.07 -0.08 1935\nDate ModiÔ¨Åed 0.03 0.01 2022\nTable 3 .Correlations between various features and the Chord\nAccuracy (CA) and Segment Chord Accuracy (SCA).\nFilter Method Pearson-rank correlation Samples\nSA\nStructure Concurrence 0.19 4643\n911 Rating 0.02 620\nGoogle Rank -0.07 1197\nDate ModiÔ¨Åed 0.06 1337\nTable 4 .Number of samples and correlation values between var-\nious features and the Structure Accuracy (SA).\n4.3 Tab Ranking Systems\nThe Pearson-rank correlation is an indication of how effec-\ntive a ranking system is. For example, if there is a high\nand statistically relevant correlation between a tab‚Äôs score\nin its 911 Rating and its CA, we can deduce the 911 Rat-\ning favours accurate tabs. Table 3 shows the correlations\nfound between the tabs‚Äô CA, SCA and 4relevant features\ndiscussed above. Similarly, we give the correlations with\nthe Structure Accuracy in Table 4.\nTwo of the correlations from Table 3 can be seen in the\nscatter plots in Figures 3 and 4. Each point represents the\nCA (vertical coordinate) plotted against a feature value (hor-\nizontal coordinate) for a single tab. The features used are\nGoogle Rank (Figure 3) and CC (Figure 4). A negative\ncorrelation in Figure 3, shows that tabs with higher Google\nRanks (lower numbers) are more accurate. A stronger trend\ncan be seen in Figure 4, where the tabs with a higher Chord\nConcurrence have a higher Chord Accuracy. Figure 5 shows\nthe correlation between Structure Accuracy and Structure\nConcurrence from Table 4. Again, there is a clear trend be-\ntween concurrence and accuracy.\nFor the sample sizes provided; the required absolute value\nfor statistical signiÔ¨Åcance is less than 0.1. Surprisingly, the\nrating given by users at 911tabs.com, the date the tab was\nmade and the Google Rank had no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant\ncorrelation with the accuracy of the tab. The strongest cor-\nrelation was provided by the Concurrence methods that had\na Pearson-rank correlation of 0.54 for CA, 0.51 for SCA,\nand 0.33 for SA.\nThese results show it is possible to improve the ranking\nof tabs by search engines based on analysing the contents of\ntabs in relation to other tabs of the same track.\n45612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 3 .

This scatter plot shows a strong trend relating\nChord Accuracy and Chord Concurrence.\nFigure 5 . This graph shows the trend between the Structure\nAccuracy and the Structure Concurrence.4.4 Automatic Chord Transcription\nOur Ô¨Ånal experiment was to compare the results with auto-\nmatic chord detection methods. Both methods satisfy the\nsame information need: Ô¨Ånding the chords to a given song.\nWe selected the top ranking tab for each feature and com-\npared the accuracy of its chord sequence with the output of\na state-of-the-art automatic chord detection system [7].\nIn Table 5 there is an example of the chord sequences\nproduced by the automatic chord recognition system, those\nselected by our features, and the ground truth annotations\nfor The Beatles‚Äô Don‚Äôt Pass Me By . The chord accuracies\nare also given. Table 6 shows the average accuracy of the\nmethods. There is a clear superiority in the automatic detec-\ntion algorithm which is over 10% more accurate, on average,\nthan the tabs selected by any of our features. Of the features,\nthe Chord Concurrence is the most successful feature for se-\nlecting the tab to use. Additionally, we can improve results\nby selecting only tabs with a high Chord Concurrence value.\nFor example, those with 90% CC or more have an average\nChord Accuracy of 79.9%. However, only 24 out of 7547\ntabs have such a high Chord Concurrence.\n4.5 Dependance on Sample Size\nA potential weakness of the Concurrence methods could be\nin being dependent on the number of tabs available for a\nparticular song. To see if this would effect performance, we\ncalculated the correlation between N (the number of tabs for\na particular song) and C (correlation between CA and CC)\nfor each of our 180 tracks. The result, 0.039, is not statisti-\ncally signiÔ¨Åcant for the sample size, suggesting that Chord\nConcurrence is a relevant indicator of Chord Accuracy re-\ngardless of the number of tabs on which it is based.\n5. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nUsing tab concurrence, we are able to order tab search re-\nsults so that the more accurate tabs are given preference,\nthereby improving the tab search experience. If ranking\ntabs based on one feature leads to a clear improvement over\ncurrent ranking systems, it is possible that greater improve-\nments can be made by selecting tabs using more sophis-\nticated combinations of features. Whilst we have limited\nourselves to analysing just the guitar tabs themselves, we\nsee possible synergies in combining this work with other\nprojects based on web-mining multimodal music metadata\n[11], content-based analysis [7], and other scores.\nThe usefulness of Chord Concurrence is not surprising,\nas errors are less likely to be replicated in independently\nproduced tabs, than the correct chords. However, the au-\ntomatic transcription result shows that a machine listening\nmethod performs better than the average human annotator,\nand this result holds even when features are used to select\n457Poster Session 3\nSource CA Chord Sequence\nGround Truth - C C F G F C C F G F C C F C G F C C F G F C C F C G F C C/5 C C F C G F C F G Csus4 C C\nAuto (Mauch) 90.4% C C F G F C/5 F G F C Cmin7 F C G F C F G F C/5 F C G F C G Gmaj6 G7 C Cmin C F C G F C F G C C/5 F\nChord Concurrence 89.4% C F G F C C F G F C F C G G F C F G F C F C G F C\n911 Rating 82.9% C F G F C C F G F C C F C G F C F G F C\nGoogle Rank 63.4% G C D C G G C D C G G C G D C G G C D C G G C G D C G G C G D C G\nDate ModiÔ¨Åed 63.4% G C D C G G C D C G G C G D C G G C D C G G C G D C G G C G D C G\nTable 5 .

This raises an interesting question\nabout ground truth: To what extent can human annotations\nfrom unknown sources be used as ground truth in MIR?\nIn future work we plan to improve on the ranking tech-\nniques demonstrated here for the purposes of recommenda-\ntion, synchronisation, tab generation and score following.\nThis work has shown that the concurrence of tabs indicates\ntheir accuracy, therefore we hypothesise that concurrency\nin subsequences and tablature notation will follow this rule.\nThe prevalence of tabs and the tools described here present\nmany interesting avenues of research, including artist simi-\nlarity, the use of chord idioms and inÔ¨Çuences across genres.\nOur experiments show, with others [8,9], that tabs are a use-\nful source of data for research in MIR.\n6.

INTRODUCTION  \nThe BBC contains a vast archive of material estimated to be \nover a million hours, most of which has  not been seen since \nit was first broadcast. The corporation is in the process of \ndigitizing this archive, but very little is known about the \nprogramme‚Äüs content. Consequently, various investigations \nare being carried out into the  automat ic classification of \ncontent and generat ion of  metadata in order to enable \nsearching and browsing of the archive when it is e ventually \npublished. However, because of the nature of the archive, \nthe user may not necessarily know what is available. Ther e-\nfore, researchers are investigating  whether the user can \nbrowse the archive according to the mood of the pr o-\ngramme they wish to se e. One aspect of this is to attempt to \ndetermine the mood of the music contained within the pr o-\ngramme and  together with other audio and image recogn i-\ntion techniques  [2], to tag a programme based on this.  \nTheme music is used to set the scene of a programme, so \none would expect a happy, light tune to accompany  an en-\ntertainment programme, and a dark, heavy tune for a s eri-\nous, factual programme [3].   \nThe field of  Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a well -\nestablished area of research with many  methods and tec h-\nniques for extracting audio features widely reported  [4]. \nConsequently, the tools used in this paper  are not  in the m-\nselves  novel, but the way in which they have been applied \nin this work is. In addition, this is arguably the first attempt \nto classify theme music, which is typically shorter than \nother pieces, using mood . The most common method for \nMood -based Music Information Retrieval (M-MIR ) class i-\nfication in the literature thus far , has been to extract audio \ncharacteristics  from music which are standalone values  \ntaken as an average over the entire piece or clip6. Certain \naudio characteristics  can be very useful . For example, the \nmood  heaviness   scales roughly with the root mean square \nenergy. To classify other, more complex moods , further \nsuch audio characteristics  are added and processed with a \nsupport vector machine (SVM) classifier [5]. An SVM \nworks as a binary classifier by taking  a set of input data and \npredicts, for each given input, which of two possible classes \nthe input is a member of. The justification of this approach \nis based on the supposition  that the computer has the ability \nto cope with high -dimensionality and to determine trends to \ncrudely mimic human perception . However, this method of \napproach does not take into account the inherent structure, \norder and progression of music. Characteristics extracted \nare often carried over from previous work into speech re c-\nognition and include Mel Frequency Ceps tral Coefficients, \nentropy and flatness  [6]. Such feature s are very useful but \nimproved performance could be achieved by using common  \nmusical  feature s such as tonality, dynamic range or tempo  \n[7]. All but the most abstract music has a set  of harmony \nand progression rules which are generally followed and are \nnot always taken into account in determining the audio \ncharacteristics and features used in M-MIR literature to \ndate.  \n \nThis work  details exploratory work with small datasets \nwhich  will form the basis of more extensive investigations. \nIt covers two new techniques for establishing feature s of \nvariables which bear a greater resemblance to the tools used \nin musical composition , offer ing a better way for  classif y-\ning the emotion of mus ic.

This work \nmakes use of the  Matlab  MIR Toolbox but uses the output \nfrom the characteristics extractors to classify musical fe a-\ntures in new ways.  It differs from existing work in that it \nuses a knowledge -driven approach to quantify how extreme \na mood is (e.g. is it quite happy or very happy?) and b e-\ncause it  is examining theme music.  \n2. EXPERIMENTS  \nUpon starting this work it was clear that a n adequate  data-\nset for the aims of the project which described the mood of \nvarious theme tunes did not exist. Therefore, in order to \ngather sufficient ground truth data to tr ain an SVM, a pu b-\nlic engagement projec t entitled ‚ÄúMusical Moods‚Äù  [8] was \nundertaken to obtain a dataset  (in which  the theoretical \nbackground , statistical data and reasoning for  the dataset \nand the dataset itself can be found) . This took the form of a \nsurvey in which 144 television theme tunes were ra ted by \nthe general public  on five point scale s along the following \nemotional axes: happy -sad, light -heavy, dramatic -calm, \nmasculine -feminine, playful -serious, relaxing -exciting.  The \naxes were chosen to corr elate with  the semantic from  Os-\ngood‚Äüs dimensional space; a three dimensional space i n-\ncorporating Evaluation, Po tency and Activity (EPA) [ 9].    \nWhilst the Musical Moods dataset was being gathered, it \nwas necessary to use a development  dataset upon which to \nexperiment. Initial investigations attempted to find trends \nin features extracted using the MIR Toolbox  [1] and the \ntracks  tagged with mood -based adjectives in the Magnat a-\ngatune dataset  [10]. Though only a small proportion of the \ndataset contained binary , rather  than quantitative mood \ntags (i.e. happy -sad as opposed to very happy, quite sad) , \nthe Magnatagatune dataset was nevertheless  considered \nuseful for classification devel opment  and initially  used to \ntrain single SVMs using a combination of the feature e x-\ntraction tools available in MIR Toolbox.  \nCertain tools in the MIR Toolbox such as mirrms , which \nfinds the root mean square  of the  energy of the track, mir-\nlowenergy , which f inds the percentage of the track time in \nwhich the audio is below a certain energy value and \nmircentroid , which finds the ‚Äûcentre of gravity‚Äü in the fr e-\nquency spectrum, were found to be very useful features to \nbe incorporated into classification of some mo od scales. \nOther tools were found to produce very useful results, but \nwhich needed to be  enhanced and modified so that the  ex-\ntracted data  could be  converted into a useful, single nu m-\nber such as for the tools mentioned above in order to be \nused for classifi cation.  2.1 Tonality  \nThe first of these was mirkeystrength . There are 12 poss i-\nble basic major chords and twelve possible minor chords  in \nmusic . The function calculates and assigns a probability to \neach of the possible 24 chords at a sample rate that can be \ncontrolled with the function. For this investigation, half \nsecond intervals were used. The function calls another \nMIR toolbox function, mirch romagram  [11], which calc u-\nlates the energy distribution for each note in the diatonic \nscale. The pitches are then concatenated into one octave \nand normalized. Next, mirkeystrength  cross -correlates the \nchromagram with the chromagram one would expect for \neach of the 24 chords and assigns a probability to each \nchord, where a probability of +1 for the tested chord would \nindicate a definite match whilst -1 would indicate a definite \nmismatch.  \nFigure 1. A graphical representation of the possible chords \nused in Last of the Summer Wine  with time. Major chords \nare denoted with capital M, minor chords with a small m. \nThe red colours denote a high degree of matching. Cons e-\nquently, this piece is predominately in C major, though C \nminor gives quite a strong match a lso. \nThe reduction of a piece of music to major or minor chords \nis an oversimplification to a certain extent. Whilst major \nand minor chords are the basic construct of a piece of \nWestern -style music, other chord types such as dominant \nsevenths, diminished s evenths, extended, other added tone \nand dissonant chords are used to great effect in music to \nelicit different emotions. However, by their nature, they are \nmore complex and hence difficult to detect and can often \nbe confused with major and minor chords. Co nsequently, \nwhen such chords are present, one would expect the key \nclarity to dimini sh. This can be seen in figure 1 , which is \nthe mirkeystrength  chromagram for the theme tune of the \nBBC television programme Last of the Summer Wine . At \naround the 3 second mark  (indicated by the black box)  an \nadded tone chord of C, D, F and A is played. The software \nunderstandably struggles to differentiate between D minor, \nA minor and F major chords as a consequence, with no a s-\n \n73612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nsigned probability particularly high  and no red  in the figure \nat this point . \nNevertheless, mirkeystrength  is an excellent tool because \nof the probabilities it associates with each chord.  The abi l-\nity to calculate tonality was thought to be of  significant use \nbecause of it was perceived to have a correla tion with \nmood axes such as happy -sad. Three feature s based on t o-\nnality were developed.  \n2.1.1 Weighted tonality  \nData  taken from mirkeystrength  was used to find a mea n-\ningful feature  for tonality which would have a correlation \nwith the happy -sad axis and the Magnatagatune dataset.  \nBearing figure 1  in mind, it was clear that the feature  \nneeded to be weighted in some way. Indeed, without \nweighting, the correlation found between t he happy -sad \naxis and the dataset was found to be poor. Consequently, \nthe feature  developed was named weighted tonality, W, and \nis defined as:  \n  (1) \nWhere:  \nKmax  =  peak tonality probability amplitude whether m a-\njor or minor,  \nKmaj  =  peak major to nality probability amplitude,  \nKmin  =  peak minor tonality probability amplitude,  \nn = the number of time intervals used to classify the sa m-\nple of music,  \nsummed over all n and divided by n. Minor keys will ther e-\nfore be of negative W. \nThis feature  gives a much clearer representation of the \noverall tonality of the music under consideration because it \nemphasises certainty where it exists and minimizes unce r-\ntain contributions. This feature  was combined  with two \nother inputs,  mirrms  and mircentroid , to train  an SVM on \n99 tracks labelled with binary tags on the happy -sad axis. \n82% of a further  194 tracks  were then correctly classified,  \nwhich  is comparable with other success rates6 and was \nconsidered to be a solid basis for the full investigation13. \n2.1.2 Weighted tonality differential  \nAs well as the overall nature of the tonality in the music, it \nis also useful to know the frequency with which tonality \nchanges. After taking time to study the sample set, it was \nfound that moods  such as exciting and dramatic tended to \nexhibit  a more frequent change of tonality and dominant \nchord . Consequently, two feature s relating to  the change in the in dominant chord were  made. The first was a weighted \ntonality differential, which detects the rate at which the t o-\nnality  changes during the course of the music.  \nIt does this by finding the transitions and multiplying the \ntransition with the sum of the certainties associated with \nthe chords before and after the transition ‚îÇKmaj - \nKmin‚îÇj+‚îÇKmaj - Kmin‚îÇj+1 (where j corresponds to the ce r-\ntainty before and j+1 to the certainty after) . It will only do \nthis at transition locations. Where there is not a transition, \nthe differential will be 0. This is then averaged over the \nnumber of time intervals, n. Again, bec ause this weights \nthe transitions with a certainty that the tonality change has \nhappened, it gives greater emphasis to clearer transitions, \nthus filtering out transitions which may not have occurred . \n2.1.3 Weighted chord differential  \nThe second feature  determined was a weighted chord di f-\nferential, which detected the rate at which the dominant \nchord changed in the piece; the chord may change but this \ndoes not necessarily mean a change in tonality (for i n-\nstance the chord can change from an A major to an E  major \nchord).  \nIt searches for the dominant chord, Kmax and detects Kmax \ntransitions. The transition is weighted with a chord trans i-\ntion certainty, which is calculated by looking at the change \nin certainty of the two keys in question before and after the \ntransition. Let us define Ki as the maximum certainty chord \nbefore the transition and Ki+1 as the probability of this \nchord after the  transition. Likewise Li is defined as the ce r-\ntainty of the new chord before the transition and Li+1 as the \ncertainty after it. The transition is weighted by the factor \n(Ki ‚Äì Li) + (Li+1 ‚Äì Ki+1). Again, where a transition does  not \noccur, the differentia l will be 0. This feature  is averaged \nover all time intervals , n. \nBecause these feature s weight the transitions with a ce r-\ntainty that the chord change has happened, it gives greater \nemphasis to clearer transitions, thus filtering out uncertai n \ntransitions .  \n2.1.4 Testing of tonality feature s \nThe Magnatagatune  dataset  contained few tags on the r e-\nlaxing -exciting axis. 150 production music clips  tagged  \nwith exciting and relaxing  in the BBC Archive  by expert \narchivists  were used as a ground truth dataset  instead  of \nMagnatagatune  and although the dataset contained the o c-\ncasional contentious tag, combining the differential fe a-\ntures with weighted tonality, mirrms and mirlowenergy  in-\ncreased successful  classification  (by ~10%)  and resulted in  \nthe correct classification of 37 out  of 50 tracks on the r e-\n737Poster Session 6\n  \n \nlaxing -exciting axis  (with the 100 remaining tracks used \nfor training)  which  is comparable with other success rates  \n[4] and was considered to be a solid basis for the full inve s-\ntigation.  \n2.2 Tempo  \nThe final feature  developed previous attempts to determine \nthe tempo of music. The extraction of tempo is desirable \nbecause it correlates with mood scales such as exciting -\nrelaxing. The field of beat extraction is a well -developed \none, with a number of beat extractors  comp etently able to \nextract the key beats  at the last ISMIR conference . How-\never, this is distinct from tempo, which is more subtle fea-\nture of the fundamental frequency and pace of the music. \nBeat extractors  such as beatroot  [13] and exist ing tempo \nextractors such as mirtempo  often overestimate the tempo \nbecause they count the half or third beat (depending on the \nnature of the music), especially in pieces where instr u-\nments with high frequency transients such as percussion \nexist. Consequently, whilst bein g able to detect pieces of \nmusic with high tempo is relatively straightforward, pieces \nwith low tempo are often labelled  with twice or three times \nthe actual value.  \n \nFigure 2. The filtered waveform of the BBC television \ntheme tune  Eastenders . Green  waveforms  (bands 3, 6, 8 & \n9) indicate the bands in which an autocorrelation of onsets \nreturns the musically correct tempo, red waveforms (bands \n4,5,7 & 10)  indicate where the function returns double the \ntempo . Blue  (bands 1 &2)  waveforms give neither.  \nFigure 2  illustrates a theme tune  filtered into ten, roughly \nlogarithmically equal frequency bands which roughly cor-\nrespond to  octaves using mirfilterbank . As can be seen, \nwhen this is done, the beat is clearly visible in certain bands, but the band in which  they occur is not necessarily \nthe same each time.  \nTempo calculations were carried out on the filtered wav e-\nforms in figure 2  using mirtempo . The function mirtempo  \ncalculates the tempo by picking the highest peak in the \nautocorrelation function of onset de tection. The green  \nbands  (3,6,8 & 9)  indicate where the tempo was correctly \nidentified, the red (4,5,7 & 10) where a tempo twice that of \nthe correct tempo was calculated. Note that in no instance \nhas a tempo half that of the correct tempo been found and \nthat the correct beat can be clearly identified in the green  \nwaveforms . \nThe solution is to apply the  mirtempo f unction to each of \nthe ten filtered waveforms. The modal  temp o is found  and \ngrouped into clusters . The standard deviation of the beats \nper minute inside each cluster is also noted to give a mea s-\nure of how precise the extracted tempo is. It is therefore \npossible to return an unspecified tempo should this value \ngo above a certain threshold.  \nWhen the data is clustered, the largest clust er (or mode) is \nfound. T he software  then searches for a tempo within 15% \nof half the value of the mode. If this exists, the s lower \ntempo is chosen as the correct tempo. The software then \nsearches for a tempo within 15% of a third of the value of \nthe mode. Again, if this exists, this slower tempo is chosen \nas the correct tempo. If neither a half nor a third tempo is \nfound, the me an value of the modal cluster is chosen as the \ntempo.  \nIn all cases tested so far, this has correctly identified the \ntempi of forty pieces of theme music. This is probably b e-\ncause the nature of the way in which the tempo is dete r-\nmined using the mirtempo  function means that the tempo is \nalways going to be over -estimated rather than underest i-\nmated and because tempo is a feature  of the fundamental \nbeat and pace of the music. Other extractors, such as \nmirtempo  alone and beatroot only achieved success rat es \nof 60 -70% on the same theme music . The tempo extractor  \nin this paper  does not work quite as well for pieces with \nunusual time signatures such as 5/4 or 7/4 , but these are not \ncommonly used in theme tunes . \nThe feature s developed above complemented  existing si m-\npler feature s. Therefore, for each of the 144 theme tunes in \nthe Musical Moods dataset, the following seven audio fe a-\ntures were extracted: mirrms , mirlowenergy , mircentroid , \nweighted tonality, weighted tonality differential, weighted \nchord differential and tempo.  \nA mean score for each mood scale for each track in the M u-\nsical Moods data was calculated  from the subjective testing  \nand then normalized so that the lowest score was 0.5 and \n73812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nthe highest score 5.49. The means were then rounded t o the \nnearest integer, giving a score 1 -5. This aligns the data with \nthe original scale with each number referenced to a tag (e.g. \non the happy -sad scale, 1 would be associated with very \nhappy  whilst 4 would be associated with quite sad ). Each \ninteger was separated by an SVM classifier and trained  as \nindicated in table 1 .  \n \nLogic score  0 1 \nSVM1  1 2-5 \nSVM2  1,2 3-5 \nSVM 3  1-3 4,5 \nSVM 4  1-4 5 \nTable 1. A summary of how each SVM separated the mean \nmood scores.  \nTo recover the mood score the classifications  are summed \ntogether and one added as in equation 2:   \n14 3 2 1 ÔÄ´ÔÄ´ÔÄ´ÔÄ´ÔÄΩ C C C CÔÅ≠\n                                   (2) \nWhere:  \nC1 =  the classification of SVM1,  \nC2 =  the classification of SVM2,  \nC3 =  the classification of SVM3,  \nC4 =  the classification of SVM4,  \nÔÅ≠   =  is the mood classification score.  \nTaking the example above, four classifications from each \nof the four SVMs of 1 1 1 0 would mean 3√ó1+1 = 4. Occ a-\nsionally one would obtain a spurious r esult  such as 1010. \nThe same equation is applie d in this instance and the track \nwould therefore classify as a 3.  \nThe dataset was randomly  split into two, the first 94 tracks \nwere used to  train the SVMs, the final 50 to test the SVMs . \nThe program optimized the classifier by choosing from \nfive possible SVM kernels: linear, quadratic, cubic,  Gaus-\nsian radial basis function s and multi -layer perception  using \nthe bioinformatics toolbox in Matlab for all of the  possible \n255 combinations of th e 7 audio features.   \nThree methods for determining the best combination of \nfeatures and SVM kernel were found. A, is the percentage \nof time that the classifier correctly identifies the correct \nmood score. B, is the average classification success rate for \nall four SVMs, C, is the percentage of time the classifier \ncorrectly identifies the correct score or classifies with the \nnearest integer (i.e. if the correct mood score of a track is 3 \nand the SVMs classify it as 2, 3 or 4, this would still count \nas a posi tive result towards C whereas a classification of 1 \nor 5 would  not).  3. RESULTS  \nThe aim of this section is to determine whether mood can \nbe quantified  for television theme tunes . The results for the \nabove three methods are shown in table 2. \n \nMood Scale  A B C \nDramatic -calm  40% 85% 94% \nHappy -sad 44% 84% 88% \nLight -heavy  30% 79% 82% \nMasculine -feminine  32% 80% 84% \nPlayful -serious  48% 81% 80% \nRelaxing -exciting  36% 82% 88% \nTable 2. The results obtained for each optimized feature . \nThe testing and training sets were then swapped and the \nsame calculations carried out . On all mood axes A, B & C \nvaried by an average of 2% with a close match in the audio \nfeatures chosen. The use of weighted tonality, the differe n-\ntials and the tempo extractor increase  the successful class i-\nfication percentages  B & C by an average of ~20%.  Table \n3 uses the  data in table 2 and gives the root mean square \nerror with respect to a baseline  in which each track is \ntagged with  a score of 3 for each mood.  All except the \nlight-heavy  scale show a marked improvement on the bas e-\nline. Much of the dataset  results  contained scores of 2, 3 or \n4, and in general table 3 indicates the feasib ility of quant i-\nfying the data  by these methods . \n \nMood Scale  baseline  A B C \nDramatic -calm  1.16 0.96 0.99 0.93 \nHappy -sad 1.44 1.20 1.11 1.11 \nLight -heavy  1.15 1.19 1.64 1.64 \nMasculine -feminine  1.15 1.06 1.08 1.07 \nPlayful -serious  1.47 1.22 1.33 1.11 \nRelaxing -exciting  1.29 1.05 1.09 1.00 \nTable 3. The root mean square error for A, B & C with a \nbaseline of mood score 3.  \nThe results  in table 2  show that measure A gave the worst \nresults, which is  not entirely unexpected given the subtlety \nbetween the classifications . B has a higher success rate  \nthan A because it is a measure of how well the SVMs in \ntable 1 are working which does  not necessarily translate \ninto an exact classification.  The best success rates are \nachieved for the measure C, but this measure has the wid-\nest tolerance . However, what C does is to classify the audio \nso that most tracks are label led with the correct tag or the \none next to it. So, for instance, audio which is tagged as \nquite sad could actually be tagged as very sad or neither \nhappy nor sad. Figure 3 illustrates how  the distribution of \n739Poster Session 6\n  \n \nscores change s upon classification  of 50 BBC te levision \ntheme tunes on the dramatic -calm scale.  Classifications of \n1 or 5 decrease whilst classifications in the middle i n-\ncrease. Whilst the ground truth data is quite flat, classific a-\ntion optimised for B and C compresses the distribution into \na large peak in the middle. This indicates that the alg o-\nrithms for optimising the SVMs do not adequately account \nfor extremes in mood (which could be explained by the \ndataset being too small, whereby the number of extreme \nmood samples is small) . Optimising for A shows a better \nmatch in distribution in this example but this method \nshows great variation between the different mood axes and \nresults in classifications that are more often wrong than \ncorrect.  \n \nFigure 3 .

CONCLUSION  & FUTURE WORK  \nThis is a promising first step towards  a scaled classification \nof television theme music  mood. The use of weighted t o-\nnality  enabled a correct  classification  of 171 out of 194 \ntracks  (82%)  using  a further 99 tracks which were  labelled \nwith binary tags on the happy -sad axis . The use of \nweighted tonality differentials  resulted in  the correct class i-\nfication of 37 out  of 50 tracks on the relaxing -exciting axis  \n(with the 100 remaining tracks used for training). The e n-\nhanced tempo extractor correctly identified 40/40 tempi of \ntheme music.  The use of the above combined  increase d the \nsucces sful classification percentages B & C by an aver age \nof ~20% to  accurac ies of up to  94% for some mood scales . \nImprovement s need to be able to classify  extremes of em o-\ntion. The work covered in this paper  does not cover  how \nthe extracted audio features coincide with each other  tem-\nporally . For instance, a sudden, very loud minor chord may \ninvoke a more complex mood than the time -averaged \nmoods determined here. Measures of dynamic progression \ncross -correlated with tonality, spectral centroid and tempo \nare a possible means to enable a better classification of more complex  and stronger  emotions over shorter tim e-\nscales and should be the focus of future work.  \n5.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic autotagging refers to the task of automatically clas-\nsifying music audio excerpts with respect to a number of\nhigh-level concepts (the ‚Äútags‚Äù) from potentially very di-\nverse music facets such as Emotion, Musical instruments,\nGenre, Usage, etc. In the literature, a number of approaches\nto the task have been proposed that build upon previous\nwork in genre and artist classiÔ¨Åcation, where a direct map-\nping is sought via machine learning models between low-\nlevel features computed on short audio signal frames and\ntags [2, 4, 10, 11]. These approaches are tailored to the fact\nthat the task is more difÔ¨Åcult than genre classiÔ¨Åcation in that\nthe number of classes is usually much higher (genres corre-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.\nAudio feature extractionLearning algo\nLearning algoStage 1Stage 2\nBinarizationevalNfeats¬Øx=0.02\nfeature values...[0¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑1]\ntag probab.Ntags...p(guitar)=0.001p(sof t)=0.03\n{0,1}\ntag membershipp(guitar)=0p(soft)=1...Ntags[0¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑1]\ntag probab....p(guitar)=0.05p(sof t)=0.02Binarizationeval{0,1}\ntag membershipp(soft)=1...p(guitar)=1\naudioFigure 1 .

Music tags are often correlated (for in-\nstance, Genre tags often co-occur with Instruments or Emo-\ntion tags), this is often the rationale behind implementing\na 2-stage architecture, where a second stage of processing,\nmodeling tag co-occurence relationships, can ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù [8]\nthe imperfect tag predictions of the Ô¨Årst stage (see illustra-\ntion in Ô¨Ågure 1). A number of authors report on perfor-\nmance improvements with this procedure over the one-stage\napproach [1, 6‚Äì9].\nThis paper aims at demonstrating via systematic experi-\nments the relevance of a number of music autotagging issues\nthat we believe are, to the best of our knowledge, only ad-\ndressed superÔ¨Åcially in current literature. After presenting\nthe data and systems used and reporting on initial experi-\nments in sections 2 and 3, we address in section 4 the notion\nof ‚Äúfragility‚Äù of evaluation methodologies and stress a num-\nber of methodological recommendations. In section 5, we\naddress the issue of generality of autotagging models, and\nin section 6, we address limitations of exploiting tag corre-\nlations in a second processing stage. We Ô¨Ånally propose a\ndiscussion on these issues and directions for future work in\nsection 7.\n2. DATA AND SIGNAL FEATURES\nIn this paper we use two datasets with tag annotations made\navailable publicly to the community by fellow researchers\n795Oral Session 10\nand on which a number of papers have reported results.\nCAL500. The Computer Audition Lab 500 (CAL500)\ndataset ( http://cosmal.ucsd.edu/cal/projects/AnnRet/ )\nis made up of 500 Western popular song excerpts of differ-\nent lengths. Excerpts annotations are among a set of 174\ntags.\nMagnatagatune. The Magnatagatune dataset ( http://\ntagatune.org/Magnatagatune.html ) consists of 21642 ex-\ncerpts of length 30 s from 230 different artists. Excerpts an-\nnotations are among a set of 188 tags. Some pre-processing\nwas applied to yield a cleaner dataset, referred to as Mag-\ntag5k (see section 4.2 for more details), on which we ran\nmost of the experiments below.\nOther datasets. We made use of two other publicly\navailable datasets with only genre annotations: the Latin\nMusic Dataset (LMD, http://www.ppgia.pucpr.br/ Àúsilla/\nlmd/index.html ) and the ISMIR04 dataset ( http://ismir\n2004.ismir.net/genre_contest/index.htm ) to evaluate the\ngeneralization capacity of our autotagging systems (see sec-\ntion 5).\nFeatures. We used MARSYAS to extract 16 audio fea-\ntures from 46ms frames of the audio signals with no overlap.\nThe features are: the spectral centroid, rolloff frequency,\nspectral Ô¨Çux, and 13 MFCCs, including MFCC0. These fea-\ntures as the same ones used in [7].\n3. AUTOTAGGING SYSTEMS\n3.1 Benchmark\nIn order to better compare our experiments with previous\nliterature and to facilitate the reproducibility of our experi-\nments, we use as a benchmark the system proposed in [7],\nwhich is available under GPL in MARSYAS.1Performance\nof the Benchmark have been reported in the 2010 MIREX\nevaluation. In this system, frame features are collapsed in\na two steps process (texture windowing and computation of\nglobal mean and standard deviation) into a 64-dimensional\nfeature vector for the whole audio excerpt [7]. This system\nimplements an architecture with two stages of processing,\nillustrated in Ô¨Ågure 1. A multiclass SVM classiÔ¨Åer is used\nin both stages. We report below on the performance of using\njust the Ô¨Årst stage of processing alone, or the whole system.\n3.2 Alternative systems\n1.External multiclass SVM in both stages : This sys-\ntem (referred to as Sys1 ) is a 2-stage system similar\nto the Benchmark, with the difference that it external-\nizes the learning algorithm and directly uses the lib-\nSVM software package ( http://www.csie.ntu.edu.\n1The authors are grateful to Ness & Tzakenakis for kindly providing\nand commenting the code used for these experiments.tw/Àúcjlin/libsvm ). The other difference is that nor-\nmalization of the data is done via the libSVM package\nand not in the MARSYAS code.\n2.One-stage Markov models-based classiÔ¨Åer : This ap-\nproach consists of using the method for genre classiÔ¨Å-\ncation based on Markov models previously described\nin [5]. In the context of autotagging, for each tag a\npair of models are estimated and used to assign a tag\nto a piece of audio. This approach is referred to as\nSys2 .\n3.3 Autotagging performance\nCAL500 Magtag5k\nBenchmark 0.452 |0.245 0.312 |0.083\nSys1 0.464 |0.269 0.423 |0.176\nSys2 0.480 |0.246 0.411 |0.171\nTable 1 . F-score g|F-score ptfor Benchmark, Sys1, and\nSys2 on CAL500 and Magtag5k. Evaluation methodology\ndescribed in section 4.2.\nTable 1 presents a comparison of the performance achieved\nwith the methods described previously and the performance\nobtained with the Benchmark. The performance measure is\nthe F-score computed on global classiÔ¨Åcation rates (denoted\nF-score g) and the F-score based on the average per-tag clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation rates (denoted F-score pt, see section 4.1 for fur-\nther methodological considerations). For both datasets Sys1\nand Sys2 perform better than the Benchmark albeit in small\nproportions in some cases. The Benchmark was chosen in\norder to have a fair point of comparison to evaluate our ap-\nproaches: it is a recent contribution that rates among the best\nin the latest MIREX evaluation (2010).\nOther examples using the same datasets can be found in\nthe literature: Using CAL500, Turnbull et al. [11], Hoffman\net al. [4] and Mahieux et al. [2] obtain F-scores ptequal to\n0.20, 0.21 and 0.14 respectively but the evaluation is based\non a ranking of the Ô¨Årst 10 most probable tags and thus\nnot comparable with our results. Seyerlehner et al. [9] ob-\ntains F-score g= 0.50and F-score pt= 0.30on CAL500\nand 0.42|0.22 with the Magnatagatune dataset thus slightly\nabove our results. Zhao et al. [12] achieve F-score pt= 0.31\non CAL500 but tags that were not recognized in the dataset\nwere ignored in the evaluation (using this metric we were\nable to achieve F-score pt= 0.33using Sys2). Similarly,\nMiotto et al. [6] obtain a F-Score pt= 0.30on CAL500 but\nless frequent tags were removed which, as we will see in the\nnext section, affects signiÔ¨Åcantly the results. To summarize,\nwe claim that the approaches presented in this paper are on\na par with the state-of-the-art as described in the recent lit-\nerature.\n79612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4. ISSUE 1: METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IN\nEV ALUATING AUTOTAGGING SYSTEMS\n4.1 On evaluation measures\nEvaluation for autotagging systems is mostly based on In-\nformation Retrieval measures, such as accuracy, precision,\nrecall, F-score, etc. These measures are generally computed\non a per-tag basis, separately for each tag and then averaged\nacross tags, or globally across the whole dataset. Music\ndatasets typically have a strong imbalance in tag distribu-\ntions, and results on a per-tag or global basis can differ sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly. This imbalance drives global scores artiÔ¨Åcially\nhigh. The reason is simple: since the most common tags\naccount for a large percentage of all annotations, classiÔ¨Åers\nthat predict these tags well start off with high global scores.\nFigure 2 shows the F-scores on CAL500 for Sys1 and Sys2,\nwhen the most frequent tags (left) or the least frequent tags\n(right) are removed from the dataset (tests with Magtag5k\nhad a similar outcome). Results conÔ¨Årm the dependence\nof global scores on the most common tags [2, 6, 11]: the\nleft plot shows a sharp decrease in F-scores gwhen the top\ntags are removed (F-scores ptalso decrease, albeit relatively\nless). This indicates that the most frequent tags are on av-\nerage better classiÔ¨Åed and have a substantial effect on the\noverall performance. This is also seen in Ô¨Ågure 6, where the\nmost common tags (the ones represented by larger circles)\nhave high scores, and the least frequent tags low scores. On\nthe other hand, Ô¨Ågure 2 (right plot) also shows that the least\nfrequent tags, with lower classiÔ¨Åcation rates, have little im-\npact on global scores but have a dramatic effect on per-tag\nscores, a fact that is most often ignored. We therefore stress\nthe importance when reporting results on reference data to\ninclude both global and per-tag metrics, and to consider the\ninÔ¨Çuence of both the least and most frequent tags. For in-\nstance, in [6] the evaluation is obtained excluding the 77\nleast frequent tags, which in our systems would result in a\nincrease in the F-scores ptabove 10%.\n20 40 60 80 1000.10.20.30.40.50.6\nn‚ó¶of tags removedF-ScoresMost Frequent Tags\n  \nF-score pt\nF-score g\nSys1\nSys2\n20 40 60 80 1000.10.20.30.40.50.6\nn‚ó¶of tags removedLeast Frequent Tags\n  \nF-score pt\nF-score g\nSys1\nSys2\nFigure 2 . F-score gand F-score pton CAL500 for Sys1 and\nSys2 autotaggers, as the most frequent (left) or the least fre-\nquent tags (right) are removed.Another important factor that can inÔ¨Çuence performance\nscores is how thoroughly the songs in the dataset are an-\nnotated. CAL500 has a high number of tags per song (an\naverage of 26tags per song): a trivial classiÔ¨Åer (i.e. always\npredicting all tags) has a precision of ‚âà15% (with 100% re-\ncall). This ‚Äústarting point‚Äù yields a F-score ptof26%, which\nis misleadingly high, and almost on a par with other results\nreported in the literature (see the F-scores ptreported in sec-\ntion 3.3). Note that in this case the F-score gequals F-score pt\nand is much lower than what is reported in the literature,\nhence a good indicator of the system‚Äôs sub-optimal perfor-\nmance.\nThe choice of evaluation measure can hinder compar-\nisons between different methods and can also conceal sub-\noptimal performances. It is therefore important to report\nboth per-tag and global scores, and ideally, also document\nhow the individual tag performances are related to the a pri-\nori tag frequencies in the datasets used.\n4.2 On data and evaluation methodology\nDepending on the data gathering method, tag-annotated data-\nsets can present several problems [11] such as misspelling,\nimpossible combinations of values, diverse types of noise,\netc. However, only few papers consider these potential prob-\nlems when reporting on autotagging experiments with the\nCAL500 or Magnatagatune datasets.\nThe Magnatagatune dataset reveals a signiÔ¨Åcant number\nof problems with annotation: (1) synonymy : we merged a\nnumber of tags (e.g. ‚Äúclasical‚Äù, ‚Äúclassical‚Äù and ‚Äúclassic‚Äù),\n(2)trivial cases : we removed excerpts with tags such as\ne.g. ‚Äúsilence‚Äù, (3) antonymy : we removed tag attributions\nof an excerpt when they were not compatible (e.g. having\nboth ‚Äúdrums‚Äù and ‚Äúno-drums‚Äù tags, or ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúslow‚Äù),\n(4)extreme sparseness : we removed excerpts with no tags,\nand (5) duplication : many excerpts in the Magnatagatune\ndataset are segments of the same original piece and have\ndifferent tag annotations, we kept those segments with the\nmaximum number of tags and removed the other segments.\nAfter pre-processing the Magnatagatune dataset as detailed\nabove, the remaining data, referred henceforth as Magtag5k ,\nconsists of 137 tags, 5259 excerpts from 230 artists. CAL500\ndid not require such pre-processing.\nTo avoid overÔ¨Åtting the data in building autotagging mod-\nels, the literature fosters a number of evaluation methodolo-\ngies, e.g. holdout validation, S-fold cross-validation, etc.\nHowever, it seldom takes into account artist Ô¨Åltering in the\ndeÔ¨Ånition of the training and test datasets, a method whose\nimportance has been demonstrated in music similarity re-\nsearch [3] (over-optimistic results can be achieved when the\nsame artists are present in both sets). Taking this additional\nfactor into account, the evaluation methodology should agree\nwith a number of constraints related to the statistics of the\ndata, i.e. the number of folds should not be higher than the\n797Oral Session 10\nnumber of artists per tag, nor than the number of excerpts\nper tag. For instance, constraints from CAL500 favors a\n2-fold cross-validation or holdout validation (instead of 10-\nfold cross-validation [11]). We report results with the lat-\nter (with a 50% split). In Magtag5k, some tags have few\ninstances, from few artists (e.g. tag ‚Äúwater‚Äù has 16 songs\nfrom 6 artists). Thus, we chose to set the maximum number\nof folds to 3 (ensuring at least 2 different artists per tag per\nfold) and report on results with 3-fold cross-validation. We\ncan clearly see in table 2 that very different results are ob-\ntained when considering data and methodology issues dis-\ncussed here and when not. To facilitate reproducible re-\nsearch, the whole Magtag5k data pre-processing and result-\ning data are available2.\n5. ISSUE 2: WHAT ARE WE REALLY LEARNING?\nIn this section we present results of a set of experiments that\nwere conducted in order to evaluate the extent of the results\nobtained with the various systems. The objective was to\nevaluate models‚Äô ability to generalize when used with data\nfrom different origins. We selected songs annotated with 35\ntags common to both Magtag5k and CAL500.3Figure 3\nshows for both the Benchmark (left) and Sys2 (right) two\nF-scores for each of the 35 tags, these F-scores are obtained\nwith Magtag5k as testset, but with two different training\nsets for building models, either Magtag5k or CAL500.4\nThe F-score obtained with CAL500 is shown on the hor-\nizontal axis while the F-score obtained with is Magtag5k\nshown on the vertical axis. On these plots a model that per-\nform equally well when trained with either datasets would\nbe on the diagonal, those performing worse when trained\nwith CAL500 data are above the diagonal.\nWhen comparing performance obtained on the same test\nset (Magtag5k) we observe much lower performance for\nmodels based on CAL500 training than for those trained\nwith Magtag5k. This observation is valid for the Bench-\nmark, Sys1 (not shown here) and Sys2. Nearly every point\nis above the diagonal. Sys2 seems to perform slightly bet-\nter than other systems in terms of generalization but still the\nperformance is much lower for models trained with CAL500:\nonly three tags obtain a relatively high F-score for both train-\ning sets ( man.singing ,electro , and female.singing ).\nModels were also tested on the LMD and the ISMIR04\ngenre classiÔ¨Åcation datasets. These two datasets were not\ncreated for autotagging tasks therefore no ground truth is\navailable so our analysis is based on tag assignment fre-\nquency. We processed the music pieces from these datasets\nwith Sys1 models trained with CAL500 and Magtag5k.

The Ô¨Årst column\nreports results on Magtag5k while the second reports results\nwith the data and evaluation methodology from [7]: 2-fold\nover the whole Magnatagatune data, without artist Ô¨Åltering.\nLooking at results for the Benchmark, we can see that al-\nthough results of the Ô¨Årst stage (Ô¨Årst row, second column)\nare very similar to those published in [7], the second stage in\nfact impairs results from the Ô¨Årst stage only, i.e. the opposite\nphenomenon than [7].

How-\never, we can gain more insights on the actual effect of the\nsecond stage by looking at Ô¨Ågure 6 which illustrates the dif-\nference in tag‚Äôs individual F-scores between using only one\nstage of processing vs using both stages. For a given data\npoint (i.e. a particular tag) to lie above the diagonal means\nthat the second stage improves results, while below the diag-\nonal means impairing results from stage 1. For the Bench-\nmark (left plot), the decrease in overall performance can be\nseen on almost all tags individually. For Sys1 (middle plot),\nif average results are better with both stages, we can see that\nnot all tags are affected in the same way by the second stage:\nsome improve (are above the diagonal) while others do not.\nIn our opinion, this distribution around both sides of the di-\nagonal indicates that no clear pattern of improvement can be\nidentiÔ¨Åed with the 2-stage procedure.\nA possible reason for the inability of the system to take\nadvantage of existing tag correlations may reside in the na-\nture of the second stage classiÔ¨Åer. Hence we experimented\na different option for the second stage: a pool of binary\nSVMs (one per tag) [8]. These experiments are restricted\nto the particular task of tag co-occurrence modeling, i.e. we\ncompare classiÔ¨Åers that process correct input (we are not\nevaluating the full system here, only what can serve as its\nsecond stage). Results show that binary SVMs are clearly\nbetter at the task than a multiclass SVM: in three-fold cross-\nvalidation on Magtag5k the former reaches a F-score gand\nF-score ptof 0.839 and 0.822 respectively while the latter\nreaches 0.581 and 0.567. A corollary of the above is that\nthe second stage may fail precisely because it is trained on\ndata that only represents estimations of these correlations\n(and relatively bad ones, as indicated by the performance\nof stage 1). Hence we modiÔ¨Åed Sys1 with binary SVMs in\nstage 2, trained with true tag annotations instead of proba-\nbility estimations from stage 1. We refer to this system as\nSys3 . Overall, Sys3 reaches F-score gand F-score ptof 0.411\n799Oral Session 10\nand 0.162, therefore slightly below the performance of Sys1\nand comparable to using only stage 1 (see table 2). However,\nwhen looking at the case of individual tags, i.e. rightmost\nplot of Ô¨Ågure 6, we can spot an interesting pattern: improve-\nments with stage 2 seem higher for tags with better perfor-\nmance in stage 1. In other words, this seems to indicate that\na minimum performance in stage 1 should be expected for a\ngiven tag ‚Äîi.e. for its probability estimation‚Äî to be useful\nin a second stage. Although proving this claim will require\nmore data, we wish to argue here that this pattern appears\nas a logical and desirable property for an autotagging sys-\ntem, and it indicates clear directions for future work: e.g.\nimproving stage 1; tailoring stage 2 classiÔ¨Åer to a selection\nof particular tags (e.g. the most reliable, the most ‚ÄúinÔ¨Çuen-\ntial‚Äù [1]) instead of processing all tags the same way.\n7. DISCUSSION\nThe experiments described in this paper show that diverse\ntechniques on a par with the state-of-the art in music auto-\ntagging fail to achieve their goal in several aspects. It was\nshown that autotagging tasks must be evaluated more care-\nfully than what is usually done, that changing the set of tags\nor altering the evaluation measure (per tag vs global F-score)\nmay dramatically alter the results, sometimes hiding weak-\nnesses. It was also shown that current techniques used for\nautotagging fail the generalization test. Finally it was shown\nthat the performance achieved with these techniques is not\nsufÔ¨Åcient to be able to take advantage of the correlations be-\ntween tags. Research in music genre classiÔ¨Åcation and mu-\nsic similarity has seen recent progresses but its adaptation to\nautotagging shows severe drawbacks. What are the causes\nof these relatively negative results?\nIt is our opinion that some key differences between auto-\ntagging and genre classiÔ¨Åcation should be given more em-\nphasis in autotagging research. In particular with regards\nto data recollection and annotation [10]. Tags can corre-\nspond to music facets more subjective than music genre. Or\nthey can have multiple meanings, as in the case of Instru-\nment tags: a song tagged ‚Äúpiano‚Äù can mean e.g. that piano\nis salient all over the song, or that there is a piano accom-\npanying (but it may be relatively quiet), or that some parts\nhave piano (but may have a short temporal span). In au-\ntotagging the procedure used to obtain ground truth differs\nfrom one dataset to another, which results in a lack of con-\nsistency. Public datasets are limited in quantity and in many\ncases present errors or incompleteness. Also, where datasets\nfor genre classiÔ¨Åcation are usually limited to 10-20 genres,\nit is common to deal with hundreds of tags. This is not a\nproblem per-se but in these conditions it is much more dif-\nÔ¨Åcult to achieve good results for every tags and to follow\ngood practices (artist Ô¨Åltering, S-fold cross validation). It\nis hard to build models based on extremely unbalanced databut it is even harder if the ground truth lacks consistency.\nFuture work will include seeking for improvements in terms\nof generalization using recently published datasets like the\nMillion Songs or CAL10k datasets.\nThis paper‚Äôs results and previous observations lead us to\npropose some directions regarding future work in music au-\ntotagging: Different processing could be applied depending\non categories of tags: (1) 2-stage architectures may be ben-\neÔ¨Åcial for some tags (e.g. tags with reasonable performance\nmight help build models for other tags) but not for others\n(discussion in [1] is also insightful on this matter). (2) Tag\nmodels could be differentiated according to temporal char-\nacteristics: models for tags that correspond to a short time\nspan should be based on local features whereas tags that cor-\nrespond to whole songs should use global features.\n8.

INTRODUCTION\nRecently, advances in technology have supported the stor-\nage of large amount of data. Therefore, fast information\nretrieval became a hot challenge. One of the most interest-\ning applications concerns with social network users, which\nhave looked forward to meet people that share common\npreferences, and also to discover new good music. Thus,\nan important task in this context is the music classiÔ¨Åcation\ninto different genres aiming a better organization of music\ndatasets, for furtherrecommendation.\nTzanetakis and Cook [22] proposed a work to deal with\nthe problem of musical genre classiÔ¨Åcation using three sets\nof features representing timbral texture, rhythmic and pit ch\ncontents, together with K-Nearest Neighbors and Gaussian\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this noticeand thefull citation ontheÔ¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011International Society forMusic InformationRetrieval .Mixture Models. Lambrou et al. [11] applied statistical fea -\ntures in temporal domain and three different wavelet trans-\nforms for the same task, and Soltau et al. [21] proposed a\nnew architecture called ETM-NN (Explicit Time Modeling\nwith Neural Networks), which employs statistical analysis\nof atemporal structure.\nXu et al. [24] applied Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\nto perform a hierarchical classiÔ¨Åcation of different music al\ngenres,andDellandreaetal.[6]comparedSVMswithNeu-\nralNetworksinthesamecontext. ChanandVasconcelos[2]\nproposed a Dynamic Texture Model (DTM) for automatic\nmusicsegmentation,andCovielloetal.[4]introducedDTM\nin the context of music tagging. McKay and Fujinaga [13]\nproposed a novel hybrid system to handle automatic classi-\nÔ¨Åcation of musical genres composed by a Feedfoward Neu-\nral Network and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm together\nwithGeneticAlgorithms(GA)forfeatureselection. Finall y,\nDeepa et al. [5] used a brute force method for feature opti-\nmization using different feature vectors with SVMs. The\nidea istocombine the best ones at the Ô¨Ånal of theprocess.\nIn order to combine efÔ¨Åciency for training and effective-\nness in the classiÔ¨Åcation task, a novel framework that re-\nduces the pattern recognition problem to an optimum path\nforest computation (OPF) in the feature space induced by\na graph was presented in its unsupervised [20] and super-\nvised versions [14]. The OPF-based classiÔ¨Åers do not in-\nterpret the classiÔ¨Åcation task as a hyperplanes optimizati on\nproblem, but as a combinatorial optimum-path computation\nfromsomekeysamples(prototypes)totheremainingnodes.\nEach prototype becomes a root from its optimum-path tree\nand each node is classiÔ¨Åed according to its strongly con-\nnected prototype, that deÔ¨Ånes a discrete optimal partition\n(inÔ¨Çuence region) of the feature space. The OPF frame-\nwork has some advantages with respect to the aforemen-\ntioned classiÔ¨Åers: (i) it is free of parameters (supervised\nversion), (ii) does not assume any shape/separability of th e\nfeature space and (iii)it runs trainingphase faster.\nIn this paper, we propose to introduce the supervised\nOPFinthecontextofmusicalgenreclassiÔ¨Åcation. Asfaras\nwe know, we are the Ô¨Årst to apply OPF for this task. In re-\n699Poster Session 6\ngardtofeatureselectioninthecontextofmusicalgenrecla s-\nsiÔ¨Åcation, it is not usual to Ô¨Ånd many works on that. There-\nfore, we would like to shed light over that another main\ncontribution of this paper is to introduce three recently de -\nvelopedfeatureselectiontechniquesaimingtoimprovemu-\nsical genre classiÔ¨Åcation: HS-OPF (Harmony Search with\nOPF) [18], PSO-OPF (Particle Swarm Optimization with\nOPF) [17] and GSA-OPF (Gravitational Search Algorithm\nwith OPF) [15]. The experiments are conducted in two\nrounds: (i)intheformer,OPFiscomparedwithSVMsanda\nBayesian classiÔ¨Åer, and (ii) in the second round we present\na comparison between HS-OPF, PSO-OPF and GSA-OPF\nforfeatureselectioninthecontextofmusicalgenreclassi Ô¨Å-\ncation. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nTheOPFtheoryispresentedinSection2. Theexperimental\nresults are discussed in Section 3. Finally, conclusions ar e\nstatedinSection 4.\n2.

IncaseofDijkstra‚Äôsalgorith m,\nafunctionthatsummedthearc-weightsalongapathwasap-\nplied. For OPF, we used a function that gives the maximum\narc-weight along a path, as explained before. Next section\nstates OPFtheory.\n2.1 Background Theory\nLetZ=Z1‚à™Z2be a dataset labeled with a function Œª,\nin which Z1andZ2are, respectively, a training and test\nsets such that Z1is used to train a given classiÔ¨Åer and Z2\nisusedtoassessitsaccuracy. Let S‚äÜZ1asetofprototype\nsamples. Essentially, the OPF classiÔ¨Åer creates a discrete\noptimal partition of the feature space such that any sample\ns‚ààZ2can be classiÔ¨Åed according to this partition. This\npartition is an optimum path forest (OPF) computed in ‚Ñún\nby theimage forestingtransform (IFT)algorithm [8].The OPF algorithm may be used with any smoothpath-\ncost function which can group samples with similar proper-\nties [8]. Particularly, we used the path-cost function fmax,\nwhich iscomputed as follows:\nfmax(/a\\}bracketle{ts/a\\}bracketri}ht) =/braceleftbigg0ifs‚ààS,\n+‚àûotherwise\nfmax(œÄ¬∑/a\\}bracketle{ts,t/a\\}bracketri}ht) = max {fmax(œÄ),d(s,t)},(1)\ninwhichd(s,t)meansthedistancebetweensamples sandt,\nandapath œÄisdeÔ¨Ånedasasequenceofadjacentsamples. In\nsuch a way, we have that fmax(œÄ)computes the maximum\ndistance between adjacent samples in œÄ, whenœÄis not a\ntrivial path.\nTheOPFalgorithmassignsoneoptimumpath P‚àó(s)from\nSto every sample s‚ààZ1, forming an optimum path for-\nestP(a function with no cycles which assigns to each s‚àà\nZ1\\Sits predecessor P(s)inP‚àó(s)or a marker nilwhen\ns‚ààS. LetR(s)‚ààSbe the root of P‚àó(s)which can be\nreached from P(s). The OPF algorithm computes for each\ns‚ààZ1, the cost C(s)ofP‚àó(s), the label L(s) =Œª(R(s)),\nand the predecessor P(s).\nThe OPF classiÔ¨Åer is composed of two distinct phases:\n(i) training and (ii) classiÔ¨Åcation. The former step con-\nsists, essentially, in Ô¨Ånding the prototypes and computing\nthe optimum-path forest, which is the union of all OPTs\nrooted at each prototype. After that, we take a sample from\nthe test sample, connect it to all samples of the optimum-\npath forest generated in the training phase and we evaluate\nwhich node offered the optimum path to it. Notice that this\ntestsampleisnotpermanentlyaddedtothetrainingset,i.e .,\nit is used only once. The next sections describe in details\nthisprocedure.\n2.1.1 Training\nWe say that S‚àóis an optimum set of prototypes when the\nOPF algorithm minimizes the classiÔ¨Åcation errors for every\ns‚ààZ1.S‚àócan be found by exploiting the theoretical rela-\ntion between minimum-spanning tree (MST) and optimum-\npath tree for fmax[1]. The training essentially consists in\nÔ¨ÅndingS‚àóand an OPF classiÔ¨Åer rooted at S‚àó.\nBycomputinganMSTinthecompletegraph (Z1,A),we\nobtain a connected acyclic graph whose nodes are all sam-\nples ofZ1and the arcs are undirected and weighted by the\ndistances dbetween adjacent samples. The spanning tree is\noptimuminthesensethatthesumofitsarcweightsismini-\nmumascomparedtoanyotherspanningtreeinthecomplete\ngraph. In the MST, every pair of samples is connected by a\nsingle path which is optimum according to fmax. That is,\ntheminimum-spanningtreecontainsoneoptimum-pathtree\nfor any selected root node. The optimum prototypes are the\nclosestelementsoftheMSTwithdifferentlabelsin Z1(i.e.,\nelementsthatfallinthefrontieroftheclasses).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn this section, we described the experiments concern-\ning automatic music genre classiÔ¨Åcation using two public\ndatasets: (i) GTZAN Genre Collection [22] and (ii) Mag-\nnatagatune [12]. Table 1 displays the description of the\ndatasets. Itisimportanttonoticethatwehaveusedasubset\nof GTZAN dataset.\nIn regard to music description, for GTZAN dataset we\nhave employed the Marsyas [23] software to extract Mel-\nFrequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC) over sequential\nwindows with size ‚âà23ms each.

Finally, with respect to Magnatagatune dataset, we\nhave used timbre features already extracted and available\nwiththatdatasettocomposeourfeaturevectorwith74char-\nacteristics.\nWe have conducted two round of experiments: (i) in the\nformer (Section 3.1) we address the robustness of super-\nvised classiÔ¨Åers for musical genre classiÔ¨Åcation, and (ii)\nin the latter (Section 3.2) we assess the effectiveness of\nOPF after a feature selection procedure over the original\ndatasets. Notice that the feature selection algorithms are\nhybrid methodologies based on OPF and three optimiza-\ntion techniques: Harmony Search (HS) [9], Gravitational\nSearch Algorithm (GSA) [19] and Particle Swarm Opti-\nmization [10].\nThe main idea of such algorithms is to use the accuracy\noveranevaluatingsetastheÔ¨Åtnessfunctiontoguidetheop-\ntimization process. Thus, the feature selection algorithm is\ndesigned over training and evaluating sets in order to Ô¨Ånd\nsuitable subsets of features that lead to good recognition\nrates over the unseen test set. These hybrid algorithms em-\nploy the OPF as the basis classiÔ¨Åer [15,17,18], since it is\nvery fast and robust,as one can seeinthenext sections.\n3.1 Musical Genre ClassiÔ¨Åcation Through Supervised\nClassiÔ¨Åcation\nIn this section, we described the experiments conducted to\nassesstherobustnessofOPFinthecontextofmusicalgenre\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. In regard to classiÔ¨Åers, we have compared\nOPFagainstSVMswithRadialBasisFunction(SVM-RBF)\nand Bayesian classiÔ¨Åer (Bayes). For OPF we adopted the\nLibOPF [16], and with respect to SVM-RBF we employed\nSVMTorch [3]. Finally, for Bayesian classiÔ¨Åer we used our\nimplementation.\nWe employed the traditional holdout method with 50%\nfor training and the remaining 50% to compose the test set.\nThe experiments were executed over 10 running with ran-\ndomly generated training and test sets in order to compute\nthe mean accuracy and training and test times (seconds).\nNotice that all parameters used in this experiment were em-\npirically chosen, based on our experience. Table 2 displays\nthe recognition rates.\nOne can see that OPF, Bayes and SVM-RBF achieved\nsimilar results for both datasets if one considers the stan-\ndard deviation. However, in GTZAN dataset OPF was 2.92\nand 6.23 times faster than SVMTorch for training and clas-Dataset ClassiÔ¨Åer Acc Tr[s] Ts [s]\nGTZAN OPF 98.61¬±0.759.19 4.40\nGTZAN Bayes 98.54¬±0.821.7194.31\nGTZAN SVM-RBF 98.72¬±0.0926.98 27.23\nMagnatagatune OPF 62.34¬±0.823.55 3.73\nMagnatagatune Bayes 61.58¬±0.812.3346.53\nMagnatagatune SVM-RBF 63.15¬±0.03162.59 35.04\nTable2.

In regard to Magnatagatune datas et,\nOPF was 45.80 and 9.39 times faster than SVM-RBF for\ntraining and classiÔ¨Åcation, respectively.\nAlthough Bayes has been the fastest classiÔ¨Åer for train-\ning,ifoneconsidersthewholeexecutiontime,i. e.,traini ng\nand classiÔ¨Åcation, OPF has been the fastestapproach.\n3.2 Feature selection\nIn regard to feature selection, we have evaluated three algo -\nrithms: PSO-OPF [17], HS-OPF [18] and GSA-OPF [15].\nFor that, we have used 30% to compose the training set,\n20% to the evaluating one and the remaining 50% for the\ntest set. Table 3 displays the parameters used to tune the\nalgorithms. The number of iterations for convergence has\nbeen set to 10for all approaches. The same occurs with\nthe number of initial solutions, i.e., number of particles f or\nPSO-OPF, number of harmonies for HS-OPF and number\nof masses for GSA-OPF, which has been set to 100. Notice\nthat these values were empirically chosen in order to avoid\nmeta-optimization.\nTable 3. PSO-OPF, HS-OPF and GSA-OPF parameters.\nPSO-OPF HS-OPF GSA-OPF\nc1= 1.4,c2= 0.6HMCR = 0.7«´= 0.7,G0= 10\nw= 0.7 k= 100\nTable 4 displays the results. One can see that all tech-\nniqueshaveobtainedthesameresultsforbothdatasets. The\ndifference relies on the execution time, in which PSO-OPF\nandHS-OPFhavebeenexecutedinasimilarperiodoftime,\nbeing up to 2times faster than GSA-OPF. We can see that\nPSO-OPFhasselected 16772out33618featuresforGTZAN\ndataset, which means about 100% of reduction in the num-\nber of features. In case of Magnatagatune, PSO-OPF has\nalso allowed 100% of reduction. It is important to shed\nlightoverthatthisreductioncanprovideafasterfeaturee x-\ntractionprocedure,withthecompromiseofsimilarandgood\nrecognitionratesasintheoriginaldatasets,i.e.,withou tfea-\ntureselection.\n70212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nDataset Technique AccTime[s] #features\nGTZAN PSO-OPF 98.78300.8540 16772\nGTZAN GSA-OPF 98.78603.2372 16776\nGTZAN HS-OPF 98.78305.5086 16776\nMagnatagatune PSO-OPF 62.57242.3991 37\nMagnatagatune GSA-OPF 62.57475.2318 44\nMagnatagatune HS-OPF 62.57244.5305 38\nTable 4.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have addressed the problem of musical\ngenre classiÔ¨Åcation by means of OPF classiÔ¨Åer, which has\nnever been applied tothis context uptodate.\nExperiments have been conducted in two rounds: in the\nformer we have compared OPF with SVMs and Bayesian\nclassiÔ¨Åerintwopublicdatasets(GTZANandMagnatagatune) ,\nand in the latter we have applied recent OPF-based feature\nselection techniques in order to speed up the feature extrac -\ntion process, and also to select the most important subset of\nfeatures that lead to high recognition rates over an evaluat -\ning set.\nIn regard to the Ô¨Årst round of experiments, all classiÔ¨Åers\nhave obtained close and good recognition rates, being OPF\nfaster for training and classiÔ¨Åcation. It is important to hi gh-\nlight that this skill is very interesting in the context of ve ry\nlarge multimedia datasets. We would like to stress the im-\nportanceofuser-friendlymusicalrecommendationsystems ,\nin which training and classiÔ¨Åcation phases need to be con-\nductedinafeasiblemanner. Inthiscontext,OPFcanbesuit-\nable for real-time retraining systems, in which new musical\ngenres and songs can be added at any timetothedataset.\nIn addition, we have conducted an experiment to select\nthe most representative features using algorithms recentl y\ndeveloped, which have never been applied to this context to\ndate. WehaveemployedPSO-OPF,HS-OPFandGSA-OPF\nover GTZAN and Magnatagatune datasets, and the results\nseemedtobeinteresting,sinceonecanreducethenumberof\nfeaturesofbothdatasetswithoutcompromisingtherecogni -\ntion rates. For future works, we intend to employ unsuper-\nvised OPF to the same task, as well as to use evolutionary-\nbased featureselection algorithms.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nAudio signal reconstruction has been of major concern for\nspeechandaudiosignalprocessingresearchersoverthelas t\ndecade, and a vast array of computational solutions have\nbeen proposed [6,7,9,10]. Audio signals are often subject\ntolocalizedaudioartefactsand/ordistortions,duetorec ord-\ning issues (unexpected noises, clips or clicks), or to packe t\nlosses in network transmissions, for instance [1]. Recov-\nering such missing data from corrupted audio excerpts to\nrestore consistent signals has thus been challenging for ap -\nplicative research, in order to restore polyphonic music re -\ncordings,toreduceaudiodistortionfromlossycompressio n,\nor to bring network communications robustness to back-\ngroundnoise,forexample[10].\nTheproblemofmissingaudiodatareconstructionisusu-\nally addressed either in the time domain, aiming at recov-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage an d that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.ering entire gaps or missing excerpts in audio pieces, or\nin the time-frequency domain, aiming at recovering miss-\ningfrequenciesthatcauselocalizeddistortionsofaudiop ie-\nces [18]. A typical trend for the latter one, often referredt o\nas audio inpainting, is to treat distorted samples as missin g\nand to attempt to restore original ones from a local analy-\nsis around missing parts. Common approaches include lin-\near prediction for sinusoidal models [9], Bayesian estima-\ntors [7], autoregressive models [6] or non-negative matrix\nfactorizationsolving[10]. Thesestudiesusuallyeitherb ase\non the analysis of distributions of signal features around\nmissing samples, or use local or global statistical charac-\nteristicsoveraudioexcerpts[18].\nHowever, missing data problems are usually addressed\non relatively small segments of audio data at the scale of\naudio piece duration. Indeed, most audio reconstruction\nsystems proposed so far are based on signal features. The\nnon-stationary aspect of such features makes it particular ly\ndifÔ¨Åcult to assign data for large missing parts. Thus, audio\ngapsaregenerallyreducedtoamaximumdurationof1or2\nseconds under particular conditions for the recovered qual -\nity to remain satisfying (see [9] for instance).

Indeed, image inpainting aims at restoring and recov-\neringmissing data in imagesin a not easily detectableform\n(seeforinstance[2]andreferencestherein). Acommonand\nsimple approach, from texture synthesis, uses the notion of\nself-distance by considering that an image has a lot of rep-\netitions of local information. This approach can be seen as\nanexemplar-basedcopy-and-pastetechnique[3,5].\nSimilarlytoexemplar-basedimageinpaintingapproaches,\nthe proposed method analyses perceived repetitions in mu-\nsic audiotorecoverlargemissingparts. Notethatwhilepo-\ntentially allowing the reconstruction of large parts, such an\nexemplar-basedapproachinducesthelimitofreconstructi ng\nexclusively parts that are approximately repeated to main-\ntain a musical consistency. To restore such an amount of\n507Poster Session 4\nmissing information,we consider the signal not only as au-\ndio excerpts but also as music pieces, therefore taking into\naccount that sounds are temporally organizedand may fea-\nture redundancies. Indeed, it is the organization and rela-\ntionships between sound events in music that make music\ndiffer from random sound sequences[14]. In Western pop-\nular music, for instance, choruses and verses often are ap-\nproximately repeated parts whose occurrences share a high\ndegreeofperceptualsimilarity. Otherexamplesincludecl as-\nsical music pieces, where the repetition of musical phrases\nstructures the forms, or electronic music where repetitive\nlooptechniquesarefrequentlyemployed.

Note that the method described in this paper aims at\nassigning a musically consistent part, and could be easily\ncombinedwithsignal-basedapproachestobeusedforprac-\ntical signalreconstructionoflargemissingparts.\nOurmethodconsists inrepresentingeachmusic pieceas\na sequence of tonal features employed to describe the per-\nceivedharmonicprogressions.

Section 4 Ô¨Ånally brings\nconcludingremarksanddepictsfuturework.\n2. METHOD\n2.1 Musical representation\nIn a Ô¨Årst step, audio signals are represented on musical-\nbased criteria. The key to a well-suited representation in\nthe particular application of Ô¨Ånding perceivedrepetition s is\nto characterize some meaningful local variations in music\nwhile being robust to musical changes. As such, pitch con-\ntent is particularlyadaptedto retrievemusical repetitio nsin\nthe context of analyzing Western music. Indeed, harmonic\nandmelodicprogressionsareconstantlyidentiÔ¨Åedbyliste n-\ners, consciously or not, and composers classically organiz e\nthewholestructureoftheirpiecesaroundsuchprogression s\nandtheirvariationsorrepetitions. Moststateoftheartme th-\nodsdealingwithmusicalstructureanalysis[16]orrelated to\nthedetectionofmusicalrepetitions[11]relyontherichne ss\nof tonalinformationto retrievesimilar segments. We there -\nfore chose to use pitch-related features to represent audio\npiecesontheirmusicalstructure.\nHarmonic Pitch Class ProÔ¨Åles (HPCP) are often used to\ndescribe this type of musical informations [8]. These fea-\ntures can be summarized as a classiÔ¨Åed representation of\nspectral energies into separate bins that correspond to thefrequencyclasswheretheyappear. Theconsideredfrequen-\ncy classes take into account the cyclical perceptionof pitc h\nin humanauditorysystem: thus, two harmonicsoundscon-\ntribute to the same chroma bin, or pitch class. Moreover,\nHPCP features were proven to be rather insensitive to non-\npitchedvariationsinnoise,timbre,dynamic,tuningorlou d-\nness forinstance,whichmakesthem veryefÔ¨Åcient in quali-\nfyingonlytonalcontextsinaudiopieces[8].\n2.2 Tonal featuresextraction\nAudio signals are Ô¨Årst divided into nsegments, or audio\nframes. We chose to use constant-length frames (as oppo-\nsite to beat-synchronouswindows, for instance) in order to\noptimize the proposed mono-parametric signal representa-\ntion and to enable our system to be potentially used on di-\nverse musical genres. Each frameis representedby a B-di-\nmensional vector h= (h1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, hB)that corresponds to a\nHPCP holding its local tonal context. The dimension value\nBstands for the precision of the note scale, or tonal reso-\nlution, usually set to 12, 24 or, in our case, 36 bins. Each\nHPCP feature is normalized by its maximum value; each\nvector his thus deÔ¨Åned on [0,1]B. Hence, each audio sig-\nnal can be represented as a sequence u=h1h2¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑hnofn\nB-dimensionalvectors.\nIn the following process, we need a similarity measure\nto compareaudiofeaturesbetweeneachother. ThePearson\ncorrelation measure ris better adapted to pitch class pro-\nÔ¨Åles comparisons than Euclidean-based measures, for in-\nstance, because it provides invariance to scaling. Such a\nmeasurethenyieldsagoodestimationoftonalcontextsim-\nilarities[20],andisusedinthefollowing. It isdeÔ¨Ånedas:\nr(hi, hj) =/summationtextB\nk=1(hi\nk‚àíhi)(hj\nk‚àíhj)/radicalBig/summationtextB\nk=1(hi\nk‚àíhi)2/radicalBig/summationtextB\nk=1(hj\nk‚àíhj)2(1)\nwhere hiandhjdenote the mean value over the vectors hi\nandhj,respectively.\nIn the particular case of comparing HPCP features, an\nenhanced measure was proposed by Serr` a et al.[17] based\non theOptimal Transposition Index (OTI). The principle is\ntocomputethelocalsimilaritymeasure,here r,betweenthe\nÔ¨Årst HPCP vector and each musical transposition ( i.e., cir-\ncularshift)ofthesecondcomparedvector. TheOTIdenotes\nthetranspositionindexofthelowestdistancefound. Final ly,\naccording to the OTI, a binary score is assigned as the re-\nsult of the comparison. In the case of a 12-split note scale\n(B= 12), for instance, a low cost is assigned to the OTI\nequals to 0 (no transposition was necessary: the local tonal\ncontext is similar) whereas a higher cost is given for any\ngreater value of the OTI. Authorshighlightedin their paper\nthe superiorityof sucha binarymeasureoverusual similar-\nity metrics for HPCP. Based on this comparison technique,\nthesimilarity measure semployedforoursystemis:\n50812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ns(hi, hj) =/braceleftbigg¬µ+if OTI(hi, hj)‚àà {0,1, B‚àí1}\n¬µ‚àíotherwise(2)\nwhere ¬µ+and¬µ‚àí, are two possible scores assigned for the\ncomparisonof hiandhj.\nTheÔ¨Årstrepresentationstepofoursystemthuscomputes\nan HPCP vectorforeach frame,which providesa sequence\nof chroma features that can now be treated as an input for\nstringmatchingtechniques.\n2.3 Stringmatchingtechniques\nAstring uis a sequence of zero or more symbols deÔ¨Åned\non an alphabet Œ£. In our context, each HPCP vector repre-\nsents a symbol. We introduce a particular ‚Äújoker‚Äù symbol\nœÜassigned to each frame that contains at least one missing\naudio sample. Thus, the alphabet consideredin our context\nis denoted by Œ£ = [0 ,1]B‚à™ {œÜ}. We denote by Œ£‚àóthe\nset of all possible strings whose symbols are deÔ¨Åned on Œ£.\nTheithsymbol of uis denoted by u[i], anducan be writ-\nten as a concatenation of its symbols u[1]u[2]¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑u[|u|]or\nu[1¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ |u|]where |u|isthelengthofthestring u.

Sincethe identiÔ¨Åeddestinationpart v‚Ä≤maybe\nlonger than the missing data segment vœÜ, the samples as-\nsignment may overlap existing samples in the audio piece.\nIn order to ensure a smooth audio transition, overlap-add\nreconstructionsareperformed[4].\nNote that we deliberately chose not to implement any\nbeat,onsetoranykindofsynchronization,inordertoavoid\nthe addition of potential analysis errors and to enable the\nstrictevaluationofthisexemplar-basedaudioalignmentm e-\nthod. We leave as a perspective such more advanced audio\nsynchronizationsoroverlappingtechniques.\n3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nOur alignment system is based on musical features. The\nidentiÔ¨Åed repetitions only depend on a musical criterion:\npitch content. Therefore, variations in timbre, rhythm or\nlyricsmayappearbetweenoccurrencesofanidentiÔ¨Åedrep-\netition and original and reconstructedaudio signals may be\ncompletelydifferent. Hence,standardsignalprocessingm et-\nrics such as SNR seem inadequate to the evaluation of mu-\nsical resemblance. Since it works on a musical abstraction,\nthe aim of the method is to produceperceptuallyconsistent\nresults,i.e., reconstructions satisfactory for human listen-\ners. The proposed experiments are therefore based on hu-\nmansubjectiveevaluationofreconstructedaudioÔ¨Åles.3.1 Test datageneration\nThe tests of our method consist in erasing random audio\nparts in a dataset of music pieces, recovering missing data\nwith our system and asking human listeners to evaluate the\naudio reconstruction. Since our method uses an exemplar-\nbased approach, a part needs to be approximately repeated\nin the same piece at least once in order for our system to\nrecover it. Thus, we introduce a repetitiveness hypothe-\nsisprior to the evaluation of the proposed system: every\nconcealed part for audio tests must belong to a repeated\nstructural section, according to a structural ground truth .\nFor instance, for a music piece annotated with the structure\nABCAAB,thehypothesisforceconcealedpartstobe chosen\nwithinoneoftherepeatedpatterns A,BorAB.\nThe test data generation is performed according to the\nfollowingprocess:\n1.Select randomly a concealment length lbetween 5 and\n16seconds.\n2.Accordingto an annotatedstructural groundtruth, select\nrandomlya repeatedsectionlastingat least l.\n3.Selectrandomlyabeginningtimeinstant dinthischosen\npart.\n4.Perform the concealment: erase everysample between d\nandd+l.\n5.Performthereconstructionusingthealgorithmdescribed\nin Section2.4.\n6.Finally,selecttworandomdurations t1, t2between5and\n10 seconds,andtrimthe reconstructedaudiopiece between\nd‚àít1andd+l+t2.\nThe last step is dedicated to reducing the duration of ex-\ncerptsinordertoreducethetestduration. Notethatwherea s\nthislaststepmakestheexperimentmorecomfortable(faste r)\nfor the testers, it tends to sharpen up their attention aroun d\nto the reconstructed region, and requires the reconstructi on\nto bespeciallyaccurate.\n3.2 Dataset\nAsatestdataset,weelectedtheOMRAS2MetadataProject\ndataset[13]thatprovidesstructuralannotationsforWest ern\npopular audio music of different artists1. For our experi-\nments, we chose to test on 252 music pieces mostly from\nThe Beatles (180 pieces), Queen(34 pieces) and Michael\nJackson(38 pieces). These artists were most likely to be\nknown by listeners, hence reinforcingtheir judgment. Note\nthat audio pieces were taken from mp3-encodedmusic col-\nlectionscompressedwitha minimumbit-rateof192kbps.\nIn orderto computeHPCP featureson audio signals, we\nchose the window size of 46msin order to keep accurate\nalignment on audio data.

Figure 2 shows the aver-\nage probability of Ô¨Ånding a repetition as a function of the\nsize of the randomly chosen part. The plain line shows the\naverage values over the dataset.

Thus,theprobabilityofÔ¨Åndingrepeatedpart s\nin pieces from The Beatles , for instance, is between 8.7%\nand16.2%higherthanonpiecesfrom Queen. Thehypothe-\nsisofdeletingexclusivelyrandompartsinsiderepeatedse c-\ntions therefore induces the consideration of 35%of15sec-\nonds parts in audio pieces, to 65%for1second parts on\naverage.\nThe previously described data generation process was\nperformed once for each music piece in the dataset. 252\nexcerpts were thus generated, each lasting between 10and\n30seconds, with an average duration of 21.8seconds over\nthe set.

First, we conduct-ed a behavioral experiment asking subjects to assess simi-larity between 10 musical recordings and 10 works of abstract art. We found a significant degree of agreement across subjects as to which images correspond to which audio, even though neither the audio nor the images pos-sessed semantic content. Secondly, we sought to find the relationship between audio and images within a defined feature space that correlated with the subjective similarity judgments. We trained two regression models using leave- one-subject-out and leave-one-audio-out cross-validation respectively, and exhaustively evaluated each model's ability to predict features of subject-ranked simi-lar images using only a given audio clip's features. A re-trieval task used the predicted image features to retrieve likely related images from the data set. The task was evaluated using the ground truth of subjects' actual simi-larity judgments. Our results show a mean cross-validated prediction accuracy of 0.61 with p<0.0001 for the first model, and a mean prediction accuracy of 0.51 with  p<0.03 for the second model. 1. INTRODUCTION Art, in any of its modes, affects us. Whether an acrylic or symphonic masterpiece, art has the tendency to attract our attention and stir our sentiments, sometimes in ways that are quite similar across modalities. An attempt to define what a work of art is or to identifying exactly why art affects us the way it does are both ambitious and elusive questions in the field of aesthetics. Yet, these seem to be some of the more progressive objectives of music infor-mation retrieval. Once we have diluted a sensuous experi-ence such as listening to a symphony into a concrete string of numbers, the source of our pleasure becomes slightly more objective (though our experience of it may remain quite ineffable). This objectivity has allowed us to examine correlations between sets of songs based on mu-sical features. Perhaps, then, feature extraction could also enlighten us to correlations across domains of art. For example, what features contribute to the phenomenon of a particular painting evoke the same feeling as a particular work of music?      This study attempts to bridge artistic domains from the perspective of feature extraction. If works of art that are emotionally ambiguous and culturally unrelated could still be considered similar, it is very possible that there is ob-jectivity in the similarity that lies at the feature level. This opens up an entirely new question in terms of cross- mod-al analysis: which auditory features and which visual fea-tures are important when considering crossmodal similari-ties? To simplify the plethora of possibilities, the study focuses on a few standard low-level features: course con-stant-Q spectrograms of the audio and eight band HSV histograms of the images. 2. RELATED WORK      Congruency across sensory modalities is a subject matter that has been discussed in the field of psychology since the seventies [1]. Cross-modal congruencies have been empirically shown to exist across the auditory and visual domains. This is not to be confused with cross- modal confusion, which is what occurs in individuals suffering from synesthesia. Typical audio-visual cross- modal congruency examples are sounds high in frequen-cy being associated with objects high in space and ob-jects small in volume, or vice versa: sounds low in fre-quency are associated with objects low in space or ob-jects large in volume. Studies in cross-modal congruen-cies support the hypothesis that art across different do-mains may affect us in similar ways.      Translations between visual and auditory art have been attempted in both directions. These attempts are known as music visualization when translating from au-ditory to visual, and image sonification when translating from visual to auditory. Traditional music player soft-ware generally come suited with some means of visualiz-ing the music. Researchers have also devised creative means of attempting the audio to visual translation, in-cluding the use of affective photos [2] and self-similarity [3]. Mardirossian and Chew also presented a way to visu-alize music in two dimensions based on the tonal pro-gressions [4]. The translation in the opposite direction, from images to music, has been investigated using the \n585Poster Session 4\n   \n geometric characteristics of images to create a time-based sequence that could be translated by musical instruments [5].      Although there has never been an explicit attempt to classify images with audio data (as in the current study), one recent study was able to classify music genre by ana-lyzing the promotional images of the artist [6]. This study used image histograms across three color spaces: RGB, HSV, and LAB to cluster image data into classes of mu-sical genre. All of the above mentioned related worksug-gests that there are some consistent perceptual relation-ships between the auditory and visual domains. 3. BEHAVIORAL STUDY 3.1 Data Collection The first step in finding similarities across modalities was to find pairs of images and audio that were thought to be similar by a group of subjects. This was done via the be-havioral experiment described in this section.  3.1.1 Stimuli Ten abstract art images by the following artists were cho-sen for this experiment: Betsy Eby, Gerhard Richter, Giles Hayter, Stephanie Willis, Ian Camleod, Madison Moore, Anne Kavanagh, Ernie Gerzabek, Paul Pulszartti, and Jason Stephen. Figure 1 shows \"Blueprint I\" by Stephanie Willis. All of the images were constructed ei-ther in the late twentieth century or early twenty-first cen-tury and all artists are Western, to avoid extreme cultural differences. The images were chosen selectively by the authors to encapsulate a range of colors and symmetries and to avoid any conceptual objects (e.g., figures that resemble a tree or a face). All of the image and audio stimuli used in this experiment can be viewed at: http://alisonmattek.wordpress.com/projects/academic/crossmodal/.      Ten ten-second solo piano clips by the following com-posers were chosen for this experiment: Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Debussy, Hindemith, Barber, Ligeti, Phillip Glass, Bill Evans, and David Lanz. This list represents Western composers across several centuries. The clips were chosen selectively by the author to encapsulate a range of tempos, pitches, and performers, but the timbre was kept relatively consistent, as all of the clips contained only the piano in the instrumentation.  \n Figure 1. ‚ÄúBlueprint I‚Äù by Stephanie Willis  predominantly modern works.  In the music selection, had solo piano works been chosen from only the twentieth century as well, there would have been a bias of chromat-icism in the harmonic quality of all of the works.  In order to achieve more variability in the harmonic structure (that is, to include extremely tonal music), we chose music from previous eras as well.  However, the cultural era in which a work was produced is likely a relevant variable, and should be considered in future investigations.  3.1.2 Listening Test Subjects between the ages of nineteen and thirty years (N = 16, 6 = female, 10 = male) completed a listening test in which they rated the similarities between all pairs of stimuli. Figure 2 shows the graphic user interface for the listening test. Some of the subjects had previous musical training (N = 10, 4 = female, 6 = male). The pairs were presented in a different random order for each subject. The first ten trials of the test were \"practice\" trials; the subjects were told they could adjust their strategy for choosing a similarity rating during the practice trials. Af-ter this, the subjects completed one hundred trials, one for every possible pair of the ten audio clips and ten images. The subjects rated the similarity between each pair on a scale of 1 - 30. 1 - 10 implied \"very dissimilar\", 11 - 20 implied \"average similarity\", and 21 - 30 implied \"very similar\". This 30-point scale was taken from Grey‚Äôs methodology for multidimensional scaling of musical timbre [7]. The subjects‚Äô responses were stored into a ten by ten similarity matrix.

Listening Test GUI  3.2 Data The results showed correlation across subjects on certain pairs of the audio and images. Figure 3 shows the mean, z-scored similarity matrix across all subjects. High values indicate a pair that was rated as very similar across sub-jects and low values indicate a pair that was rated as very dissimilar across subjects. \n Figure 3.  Mean Similarity Matrix for All Subjects       The data was analyzed with plots, covariance matrices, and distance matrices of the z-scored subject responses. Figure 4 shows an analysis of the sixth audio clip, which was an excerpt from Samuel Barber's Excursion No. 1 for solo piano. The plot shows the z- scored subject responses to audio 6 when paired with each of the images, as indi-cated on the x-axis. What stands out on this plot is that the similarity ratings decrease when audio 6 is compared to image 7, increase when audio 6 is compared to image 8, and decrease again when audio 6 is compared to image 9. In other words, audio 6 was considered to be very similar to image 8, but very dissimilar to image 7 and image 9, with much agreement across subjects.      From this type of analysis on all of the data, the fol-lowing pairs of images and audio were thought to be simi-lar across subjects: audio 1 and audio 8 were similar to image 6; audio 2 and audio 10 were similar to image 7; audio 3 and audio 7 were similar to image 1, image 4, and image 9; audio 4 and audio 5 were similar to image 3; audio 6 was similar to image 8; and audio 9 was similar to image 10. Images 2 and 5 were not consistently rated as similar to any audio examples. Figure 5 shows image 5, which was not consistently rated as similar or dissimilar to any audio across subjects. \n Figure 4.  Analysis of Audio 6   \n Figure 5.  ‚ÄúComposition 114-B‚Äù by Ian Comleod was not con-sistently rated as similar to any of the audio examples. 4. IMAGE PREDICTION Given the subjective cross-modal similarity evaluation, we sought to determine whether there were correspond-ences in common between the underlying audio and im-age features spaces. To this end, from the 10 audio clips we extracted average power with a band rate of two con-stant- Q bands per octave [9]. From the images we ex-tracted eight-band HSV histograms. The HSV representa-tion was chosen over RGB because, like the choice of logarithmic frequency spectrum, the HSV color scale cor-responds more closely with human perception than the RGB scale [10]. The HSV values were binned into 3 groups of 8 scalars forming a 24 dimensional vector. The 16 audio bands and 24 image values were independently dimension reduced using a singular value decomposition (SVD) keeping those coefficients corresponding to the first 95% of the total variance in each modality. \n587Poster Session 4\n   \n 4.1 Multivariate Multiple regression To test the predictability of image features given audio features for an unseen music clip, we performed a retriev-al experiment using a cross-validated multivariate multi-ple regression model [11]. Regression is an optimization method that minimizes the response error for a training set of predictor/response vector pairs (in our case audio features / image features) using a linear model of the form: y=WTx+b, with weight matrix, W , predictor varia-bles, x, biases b, and response variables y. Our models consisted of multiple independent variables (audio-feature predictors), and multivariate dependent variables (image-feature responses). Such multivariate multiple regression has previously been applied, in a cross-modal context, to predicting fMRI images corresponding to concrete nouns; where the predictor variables were intermediate vector representations of single words and the response variables were fMRI image voxels [12].      Figure 6 illustrates the method of predicting image features from a regression model trained on audio feature / image feature pairs. Figure 7 shows an example of audio features, a weight matrix, and the predicted response, ac-tual response, and residual images. \n Figure 6.  Schematic diagram showing how regression is used to predict response variables from predictor variables. In this paper, the predictor variables are audio features, and the re-sponse variables are image features. \n Figure 7.  Example of audio features (upper left), trained regres-sion model weights (upper right), predicted image (lower left), and actual image (lower right), for a leave-one-audio-out regres-sion model. 4.2 Training We trained the regression models using the mvregress function from the Statistics Toolbox of the MATLAB numerical scientific package. The training data consisted of the dimension-reduced features of the audio clips as predictor variables and the dimension-reduced image fea-tures for each subject‚Äôs highest-rated image (i.e., the most similar image as determined by the similarity judgments) as the response variables. We trained two models: Model 1 was trained using subjects' image response ratings for each audio clip, leaving out one subject's data in each run; Model 2 was trained using all subjects' image response ratings, leaving out one of the audio clips in each run.    4.3 Ground Truth The data from the behavioral study‚Äî i.e. per subject similarity ratings between each audio clip and each im-age‚Äî yielded per subject 10x10 similarity matrices where each row consisted of the image rankings to one audio clip with integer values in the range of 1 to 30. Each sub-ject utilized the scale to a different extent; with some us-ing the full range and others using only part of the availa-ble range. To align the different ranges onto a common scale, each row was normalized to the range of 0 to 1. The individual normalized similarity matrices were then aver-aged yielding a cross-subject mean similarity matrix. From this matrix, a ground truth of relevant images was determined individually for each audio clip, but across subjects, by selecting all images with an average similari-ty greater than, or equal to, the mean plus one standard deviation of the normalized similarity ratings for that au-dio clip. This yielded a different number of relevant im-ages for each audio clip ranging from one to three rele-vant images. These were used as the target images for each audio clip in the retrieval experiments.  Note that for Model 1, the ground truth consisted of a mean similarity matrix that excluded the held-out subject; i.e. the test sub-ject's data.  4.4 Prediction One of the main utilities of regression is that responses can be computed for novel data‚Äî such that the response variables interpolate between the training data for previ-ously unseen data. Thus, the trained regression models were used to predict the response variables (image feature vector) for each test feature vector (held-out audio feature vector). A successful interpolation would indicate gener-ality of the model; specifically, the generalization of the subjective cross-modal feature-space mappings, such that the model could be used to predict the human subjective image response to unseen music audio data.  4.5 Evaluation To evaluate the degree of success of the models' predic-tions, the set of ground truth images per audio clip was \n58812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   \n used in a retrieval task. The two models performed slight-ly different retrieval tasks: Model 1 left a different sub-ject‚Äôs predictor/response feature data out per run, for a total of 16 subjects. Here the goal was to was to assess the degree to which an individual subject's responses affect the image prediction result. The model was trained and tested repeatedly, omitting a single subject‚Äôs data each time, on the set of features corresponding to closest audio-image pairs from the remaining subjects‚Äô similarity scores. To test, a response image feature was predicted for each audio feature using the regression weights. The co-sine distance was computed between the predicted image feature vector and the set of 10 feature vectors for the 10 images that the test subject ranked in the behavioral ex-periment. The distances were sorted such that those imag-es whose features were most similar to the predicted fea-tures were ranked more highly in the list of retrieved im-ages. Precision and recall values were computed by com-paring each ranked image with the relevant image set (ground truth). The recall level was also calculated; i.e. the proportion of ground truth images retrieved for each position in the retrieved image list. The mean precision was calculated by summing over all precision values and dividing by the total number of relevant items across all trials. Additionally, an f-score was computed using the 2P.R/(P+R) statistic and the mean f-score computed in a similar manner as the mean precision. Empirical p-values were computed using the distribution of mean precisions for 10,000 trials of randomly ordered image draws versus image draws ordered by similarity to the regression mod-el's predicted images. The resulting probability is inter-preted as the empirical probability that retrieval using randomly permuted image draws performed at least as well as retrieval using regression.       Model 2 was evaluated to test the generality of the model for unseen audio data. For this model, a leave-one-audio-out cross validation paradigm was used. Here, each training iteration omitted the audio / image feature pairs corresponding to one of the audio clips for all subjects. Testing consisted of predicting response image features for each held-out audio feature. As in Model 1, the cosine distance between each predicted image feature vector and the set of ground-truth images for the held-out audio clip yielded a ranked retrieval list of images that was used to calculate precision, recall, f-measure, and p-values, as discussed above.      By leaving one example out for testing, the models used 16-fold and 10-fold cross-validation respectively, a commonly used statistical technique for estimating the generalization power of a given model.  Furthermore, 10-fold cross-validation has been shown to be one of the best methods to use for model selection [13]. 5. RESULTS The results of both image prediction experiments are shown in Table 1. We performed a sensitivity analysis by systematically selecting subsets of features from the pre-dictor and response variables used for the regression and retrieval. In Table 1, results are shown both for the full ensemble and the best performing subsets of audio and image features. For the best-performing subset of fea-tures, 3 audio dimensions were left out and 2 image di-mensions. The p-values for the average precision were p<0.0001 for Model 1 and p<0.03 for Model 2. Figures 8 and 9 show the precision-recall curves for the two models for 1/10th percentile standardized recall levels. Model # trials avg. pre-cision avg.              f-score p-value 1 (full) 160 0.498 0.311 p<0.0001 2 (full) 18 0.299 0.248 0.867 1 (subset) 160 0.605 0.366 p<0.0001 2 (subset) 18 0.511 0.321 0.028 Table 1.  Cross-validation results for regression model audio-image feature prediction of 16 human subjects‚Äô image response data to music stimuli. The subset model used four of seven audio features, and five of seven image features. Both versions of Model 1 perform significantly better than chance, with the per-subject-validation yielding a significance score of p<0.0001 (p=0 for 10,000 trials). However, only the feature subset version of Model 2 performed significantly above chance with p<0.03. The difference in performance between the two experiments is not wholly surprising. In the first experiment, the predictor/response data for a single subject is left out, but there are still 15 complete sets of audio-image data on which to train the regression model. Figure 8 illustrates the degree to which individual subjects‚Äô data influences the overall result. The spread of the mean precision across individual runs is limited. Hence, we conclude that no one subject is contributing significantly more to the result than any other.  Figure 9 illustrates that the spread of results for the held-out audio-image data, across all subjects, varies significantly. This indicates unequal contributions to the model from different audio predictors and their corresponding cross- subject image responses. 6. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that it is possible to predict the relationship between artistic examples from both the audio and visual domains using feature extraction. Our perceptions of art are complex and multidimensional, even within a single domain, so multiple features from \n589Poster Session 4\n   \n each domain are likely contributing to the similarities perceived across domains. This makes the investigation of cross-modal congruencies within feature spaces particu-larly challenging. \n Figure 8. Retrieval performance for Model 1 showing the mean precision of individual runs (dashed lines) and the mean precision taken over all runs (solid line). \n Figure 9.  Retrieval performance for Model 2 showing the mean precision of individual runs (dashed lines) and the mean precision taken over all runs (solid line). Here, the model is trained on all subjects‚Äô most similar audio-image feature pairs for left-in audio.       Further research can investigate the correlations be-tween multiple features of audio and images. The choice of features in this study was somewhat arbitrary, but seemed like an intuitive place to start.  The techniques used here demonstrated the use of low-level features. However, the complexity of the problem suggests that many more features are contributing to the relationship between domains.      A primary limitation of the results of this study is a possible lack of generalizability due to the small size of the data set.  The data set was kept small out of considera-tion for the behavioral experiment design.  The subjects had to give similarity ratings for all possible combinations of visual and auditory art, which amounted to 100 trials total.  With this amount of stimuli, the behavioral test took 30-40 minutes.  Adding more stimuli would cause the behavioral test to increase in length exponentially.  Considering the attention span of subjects is important in this regard, because an experiment that was much longer could have compromised the integrity of the responses.      Research in the area of cross-modal congruencies pro-vides a step towards understanding the perceptual pro-cesses related to cross-modal binding. Our minds our con-stantly receiving input streams from various senses and must use them to create the continuous and whole experi-ence of consciousness. Identifying how modality- specific features relate and integrate across domains is a funda-mental part of the discovery of our constant reality, e plu-ribus unum. 7.

Three of the features are based on the prior extraction of the predominant melody line, and have not been used in the context of vocal/instrumental activity detection.

INTRODUCTION\nThe presence and quality of vocals and other melody instru-\nments in a musical recording are understood by most listen-\ners, and often these are also the parts of the music listeners\nare interested in. Music enthusiasts, radio disk-jockeys and\nother music professionals can use the locations of vocal and\ninstrumental activity to efÔ¨Åciently navigate to the song po-\nsition they‚Äôre interested in, e.g. the Ô¨Årst vocal activity, or the\nguitar solo. In large music collections, the locations of vo-\ncal and instrumental activity can be used to offer meaningful\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.audio thumbnails (song previews) and better browsing and\nsearch functionality.\nDue to its apparent relevance to music listeners and in\ncommercial applications the automatic detection of vocals\nin particular has received considerable attention in the recent\nMusic Information Retrieval literature, which we review be-\nlow. Far less attention has been dedicated to the detection of\ninstrumental solos in polyphonic music recordings.\nIn the present publication we present a state-of-the-art\nmethod for vocal activity detection. We show that the use\nof several different timbre-related features extracted based\non a preliminary extraction of the predominant melody line\nprogressively improve the performance of locating singing\nsegments. We also introduce the new task of instrumental\nsolo detection and show that, here too, the combination of\nour proposed features leads to substantial performance in-\ncreases.\nSeveral previous approaches to singing detection in poly-\nphonic music have relied on multiple features. Berenzweig\n[2] uses several low-level audio features capturing the spec-\ntral shape, and learned model likelihoods of these. Fujihara\nuses both [3] a spectral feature and a feature that captures\npitch Ô¨Çuctuation based on a prior estimation of the predom-\ninant melody. Thus more aspects of the complex human\nvoice can be captured and modelled. In fact, Regnier and\nPeeters [14] note that ‚Äúthe singing voice is characterized\nby harmonicity, formants, vibrato and tremolo‚Äù. However,\nmost papers are restricted to a small number of (usually\nspectral) features [8, 9, 14]. Nwe and Li [12] have proposed\nthe most diverse set of features for vocal recognition that we\nare aware of, including spectral timbre, vibrato and a mea-\nsure of pitch height.\nOur method is similar to that of Nwe and Li in that we\nuse a wide range of audio features. However, our novel mea-\nsurement of pitch Ô¨Çuctuation (similar to vibrato) is tuning-\nindependent and based on a prior extraction of the predom-\ninant melody. Furthermore, we propose two new features\nthat are also based on the preliminary melody extraction\nstep: the timbre (via Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients) of\nthe isolated predominant melody, and the relative amplitude\nof the harmonics of the predominant melody.\n233Poster Session 2\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in\nSection 2 we describe the features used in our study. Sec-\ntion 3 describes a new set of highly detailed ground truth\nannotations for more than 100 songs published with this pa-\nper. The experimental setup and the machine learning tools\ninvolved in training and testing our methods are explained\nSection 4. The results are discussed in Section 5. Limi-\ntations of the present method and future directions are dis-\ncussed in Section 6.\n2. AUDIO FEATURES\nThis section introduces the four audio features considered in\nthis paper: the standard MFCCs, and three features based on\nthe extracted melody line: pitch Ô¨Çuctuation, MFCCs of the\nre-synthesized predominant voice, and the relative harmonic\namplitudes of the predominant voice.\nWe Ô¨Årst extract all features from each track at a rate of\n100 frames per second from audio sampled at 16 kHz, then\nlow-pass Ô¨Ålter and downsample them to obtain features at 10\nframes per second, which we use as the input to the training\nand testing procedures (Section 4).\n2.1 Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients\nMel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients [11] are a vector-shaped\nfeature which has the desirable property of describing the\nspectral timbre of a piece of audio while being largely ro-\nbust to changes in pitch. This property has made them the\nde facto standard input feature for most speech recognition\nsystems. The calculation of MFCCs consists of a discrete\nFourier transform of the audio samples to the frequency do-\nmain, applying an equally-spaced Ô¨Ålter bank in the mel fre-\nquency scale (approximately linear in log frequency), and\nÔ¨Ånally applying the discrete cosine transform to the loga-\nrithm of the Ô¨Ålter bank output. Details are extensively cov-\nered elsewhere, see e.g. [13]. In our implementation, the\nhop size is 160 samples (10 ms), the frame size is 400 sam-\nples (a 512-point FFT was used with zero-padding) and the\naudio window used is a Hamming window.\n2.2 Pitch Fluctuation\nThe calculation of pitch Ô¨Çuctuation involves three steps:\nfundamental F0: estimate the fundamental frequency (F0)\nof the predominant voice at every 10ms frame using\nPreFEst [4], and take the logarithm to map them to\npitch space,\ntuning shift: infer a song-wide tuning from these estimates,\nshift the estimates so that they conform to a standard\ntuning and wrap them to a semitone interval,\nintra-semitone Ô¨Çuctuation: calculate the standard devia-\ntion of the frame-wise frequency difference.We use the program PreFEst [4] to obtain an estimate of\nthe fundamental frequency (F0) of the predominant voice at\nevery 10ms frame. For a frame at position t‚àà{1,...,N}\nin which PreFEst detects any fundamental frequency f[t]we\nconsider its pitch representation f‚àó\nlog[t] = log2f[t], i.e. the\ndifference between two adjacent semitones is1\n12.\nThe tuning shift in the second step is motivated as fol-\nlows: our Ô¨Ånal pitch Ô¨Çuctuation measure employs pitch esti-\nmates wrapped into the range of one semitone. The wrapped\nrepresentation has the beneÔ¨Åt of discarding sudden octave\njumps and similar transcription artifacts, but if the semitone\nboundary is very close to the tuning pitch of the piece, then\neven small Ô¨Çuctuations will cross this boundary (they ‚Äòwrap\naround‚Äô) and lead to many artiÔ¨Åcial jumps of one semitone.\nThis can be avoided if we shift the frequency estimates such\nthat the new tuning pitch is at the centre of the wrapped\nsemitone interval. In order to calculate the tuning of the\npiece we use a histogram approach (like [6]): all estimated\nvaluesf‚àó\nlog[t],t‚àà{1,...,N}are wrapped into the range of\none semitone,\nf‚àó\nlog[t]/parenleftbigg\nmod1\n12/parenrightbigg\n,t‚àà{1,...,N}, (1)\nand sorted into a histogram (h1,...,h 100)with 100 his-\ntogram bins, equally-spaced at1\n1200, or one cent. The rela-\ntive tuning frequency is obtained from the histogram as\nfref\nlog =(arg max ihi)‚àí1\n1200‚àí0.5 (2)\n‚àà {‚àí 0.5,‚àí0.49,..., 0.49},\nand the semitone-wrapped frequency estimates we use in the\nthird step are\nflog[t] =/parenleftbig\nf‚àó\nlog[t]‚àífref\nlog/parenrightbig/parenleftbigg\nmod1\n12/parenrightbigg\n,t‚àà{1,...,N}.\nThe third step calculates a measure of Ô¨Çuctuation on win-\ndows of the frame-wise values flog[t]. We use Fujihara‚Äôs for-\nmulation [3] of the frequency difference (up to a constant)\n‚àÜflog[t] =2/summationdisplay\nk=‚àí2k¬∑flog[t+k] (3)\nand deÔ¨Åne pitch Ô¨Çuctuation as the Hamming-weighted stan-\ndard deviation of values ‚àÜflog[.]in a neighbourhood of t,\nF[t] = 12¬∑/radicaltp/radicalvertex/radicalvertex/radicalbt50/summationdisplay\nk=1wk(‚àÜflog[t+k‚àí25]‚àí¬µ[t])2,(4)\nwhere¬µ[t] =/summationtext50\nk=1wk‚àÜflog[t+k‚àí25]is the Hamming-\nweighted mean, and wk,k= 1,..., 50is a Hamming win-\ndow scaled such that/summationtext\nkwk= 1.\nIn short, F [t]summarises the spread of frequency changes\nof the predominant fundamental frequency in a window around\nthetthframe.\n23412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n2.3 MFCCs of Re-Synthesised Predominant Voice\nWe hypothesize that audio features that describe the pre-\ndominant voice in a polyphonic recording in isolation will\nimprove the characterisation of the singing voice and solo\ninstruments. To obtain such a feature we re-synthesize the\nestimated predominant voice and perform the MFCC fea-\nture extraction on the resulting monophonic waveform. For\nthe re-synthesis itself we use an existing method [3] which\nemploys sinusoidal modelling based on the PreFEst esti-\nmates of predominant fundamental frequency and the esti-\nmated amplitudes of the harmonic partials pertaining to that\nfrequency. MFCC features of the re-synthesized audio are\ncalculated as explained in Section 2.1. They describe the\nspectral timbre of isolated the most dominant note.\n2.4 Normalised Amplitudes of Harmonic Partials\nThe MFCC features described in Sections 2.1 and 2.3 cap-\nture the spectral timbre of a sound, but they do not con-\ntain information on another dimension of timbre: the nor-\nmalised amplitudes of the harmonic partials of the predom-\ninant voice. Unlike the MFCC feature of the re-synthesised\npredominant voice, this feature uses the amplitude values\nthemselves, i.e. at every frame the feature is derived from\nthe estimated harmonic amplitudes A= (A1,...,A 12)by\nnormalising them according to the Euclidean norm,\nHi=Ai/radicalbig/summationtext\niA2\ni(5)\n3. REFERENCE ANNOTATIONS\nWe introduce a new set of manually generated reference an-\nnotations to 112 full-length pop songs: 100 songs from the\npopular music collection of the RWC Music Database [5],\nand 12 further pop songs. The annotations describe ac-\ntivity in contiguous segments of audio using seven main\nclasses: f‚Äì female lead vocal, m‚Äì male lead vocal, g‚Äì\ngroup singing (choir), s‚Äì expressive instrumental solo, p‚Äì\nexclusively percussive sounds, b‚Äì background music that\nÔ¨Åts none of the above, n‚Äì no sound (silence or near si-\nlence). There‚Äôs also an additional elabel denoting the end\nof the piece. In practice, music does not always conform to\nthese labels, especially when several expressive sources are\nactive. In such situations we chose to annotate the predomi-\nnant voice (with precedence for vocals) and added informa-\ntion about the conÔ¨Çict, separated by a colon, e.g.\nm:withf .\nSimilarly, the label for expressive instrumental solo, s, is\nalways further speciÔ¨Åed by the instrument used, e.g.\ns:electricguitar .\nbackground 22.0 %female 30.6 %\nmale 32.8 %group 2.0 %inst. solo 12.6 %Figure 1 : Ground truth label distribution: the pie chart la-\nbels provide information on the distribution in the extended\nmodel with Ô¨Åve classes. The simple model joins all vocal\nclasses (dark grey, 65.4%) and all non-vocal classes (light\ngrey, 34.6%).\nThe reference annotations are freely available for download1.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\nWe used 102 of the ground truth songs and mapped the rich\nground truth annotation data down to fewer classes accord-\ning to two different schemes:\nsimple contains two classes: vocal (comprising ground truth\nlabels f,mandg) and non-vocal (comprising all other\nground truth labels)\nextended contains Ô¨Åve classes: female ,male ,group for the\nannotations f,mandg, respectively; solo(ground truth\nlabels); and remainder (all remaining labels)\nThe frequency of the different classes is visualised in Fig-\nure 1. Short background segments (ground truth label b)\nof less than 0.5 s duration were merged with the preceding\nregion.\nWe examine seven different feature conÔ¨Ågurations, the\nfour single features pitch Ô¨Çuctuation (F), MFCCs (M), MFCCs\nof the re-synthesised melody line (R) and normalised apli-\ntudes of the harmonics (H), and the following progressive\ncombinations of the four: FM, FMR and FMRH.\nThe relevant features in each feature conÔ¨Åguration are\ncast into a single vector per frame. We use the support vec-\ntor machine version of a hidden Markov model [1] SVM-\nHMM [7] via an open source implementation2. We trained\na model with the default order of 1, i.e. with the probability\nof transition to a state depending only on the respective pre-\nvious state. The slack parameter was set to c= 50 , and\nthe parameter for required accuracy was set to e= 0.6.\nThe 102 songs are divided into Ô¨Åve sets for cross-validation.\nThe estimated sequence is of the same format as the mapped\nground truth, i.e. either two classes ( simple schema) or Ô¨Åve\nclasses ( extended schema).\n1http://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/\nAIST-Annotation/\n2http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/\nsvm_hmm.html\n235Poster Session 2\nHRMFFMFMRFMRH\naccuracy0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8simple\next. 62.5%68.2%70.8%73.6%70.4%73.8%74.4%79.2%79.8%82.7%82.8%85.2%84.9%87.2%(a) accuracy\nHRMFFMFMRFMRH\nspecificity0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8simple\next. 52.2%12.0%64.9%37.1%58.1%38.3%68.2%60.7%73.6%67.6%80.2%73.7%82.4%77.8% (b) speciÔ¨Åcity\nHRMFFMFMRFMRH\nsegmentation metric0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8simple\next. 54.4%39.3%61.5%60.3%61.6%54.9%53.6%63.1%66.7%67.6%67.5%69.9%68.8%72.4% (c) segmentation accuracy\nFigure 2 : V ocal activity detection (see Section 5.1).\n5. RESULTS\nIn order to give a comprehensive view of the results we\nuse four frame-wise evaluation metrics for binary classiÔ¨Å-\ncation: accuracy, precision, recall/sensitivity and speciÔ¨Åcity.\nThese metrics can be represented in terms of the number of\ntrue positives (TP; method says its positive and ground truth\nagrees), true negatives (TN; method says it‚Äôs negative and\nground truth agrees), false positives (FP; method says it‚Äôs\npositive, ground truth disagrees) and false negatives (FN;\nmethod says it‚Äôs negative, ground truth disagrees).\naccuracy =TP+TN\n# all frames, precision =TP\nTP+FP\nrecall =TP\nTP+FN, speciÔ¨Åcity =TN\nTN+FP.\nWe also provide a measure of segmentation accuracy as one\nminus the minimum of the directional Hamming divergences,\nas proposed by Christopher Harte in the context of measur-\ning chord transcription accuracy. For details see [10, p. 52].\n5.1 Vocal Activity Detection\nTable 1 provides all frame-wise results of vocal activity\ndetection in terms of the four metrics shown above. The\nhighest overall accuracy of 87.2% is achieved by the simple\nFMRH method. The difference to the second-best algorithm\nin terms of accuracy ( simple FMRH) is statistically signiÔ¨Å-\ncant according to the Friedman test ( pvalue:<10‚àí7).\nAccuracy of single features. Figure 2a shows the dis-\ntinct accuracy differences between the individual single au-\ndio features. The H feature by itself has a very low accu-\nracy of 68.2% (62.5% in the extended model). The accuracy\nobtained by either the MFCC-based features, M and R are\nalready considerably higher‚Äîup to 73.8%‚Äîand the pitch\nÔ¨Çuctuation measure F is the measure with the highest accu-\nracy of 79.2% (73.4% in the extended model) among modelswith a single feature. This suggests that pitch Ô¨Çuctuation is\nthe most salient feature of the vocals in our data.\nProgressively combining features. It is also very clear\nthat the methods using more than one feature have an ad-\nvantage: every additional feature increases the accuracy of\nvocal detection. In particular, the R feature‚ÄîMFCCs of\nthe re-synthesised melody line‚ÄîsigniÔ¨Åcantly increases ac-\ncuracy when added to the feature set that already contains\nthe basic MFCC features M. This suggests that R and M\nhave characteristics that complement each other. More sur-\nprising, perhaps, is the fact that the addition of the H feature,\nwhich is a bad vocal classiÔ¨Åer on its own, leads to a signiÔ¨Å-\ncant improvement in accuracy.\nPrecision and SpeciÔ¨Åcity. If we consider the accuracy\nvalues alone it seems to be clear that the simple model is\nbetter: it outperforms the extended model in every feature\nsetting. This is, however, not the conclusive answer. Accu-\nracy tells only part of the story, and other measures such as\nprecision and speciÔ¨Åcity are helpful to examine different as-\npects of the methods‚Äô performance. The recall measure does\nnot provide very useful information in this case, because‚Äî\nunlike in usual information retrieval tasks‚Äîthe vocal class\noccupies more than half the database, see Figure 1. Hence,\nit is very easy to make a trivial high-recall classiÔ¨Åer by ran-\ndomly assigning a high proportion xof frames to the pos-\nitive class. To illustrate this, we have added theoretical re-\nsults for the trivial classiÔ¨Åers ‚Äòrand- x‚Äô to Table 1. A more\ndifÔ¨Åcult problem, then, is to make a model that retains high\nrecall but also has high precision and speciÔ¨Åcity. SpeciÔ¨Åcity\nis the recall of the negative class, i.e. the ratio of non-vocal\nframes that have been identiÔ¨Åed as such, and precision is\nthe ratio of truly vocal frames in what the automatic method\nclaims it is. The extended methods outperform each cor-\nresponding simple method in terms of precision and speci-\nÔ¨Åcity.

As we would expect from the\nabove results, the segmentation accuracy, too, improves with\nincreasing model complexity. The top segmentation accu-\nracy of the top score of 0.724 is is approaching that of state-\nof-the-art chord segmentation techniques (e.g. [10, p. 88],\n0.782). For the four best feature combinations the simple\nmethods slightly outperform the extended ones, by 2 to 4\npercentage points.\nThe best extended method, extended FMRH, has the high-\nest precision (90.3%) and speciÔ¨Åcity (82.4%) values of all\ntested algorithms, while retaining high accuracy and recall\n(84.9% and 86.3%, respectively). In most situations this\nwould be the method of choice, though the respective sim-\nplemethod has a slight advantage in terms of segmentation\naccuracy.\n5.2 Instrumental Solo Activity\nMore difÔ¨Åcult than detecting vocals is detecting the instru-\nmental solos in polyphonic pop songs because they occupy\na smaller fraction of the total number of frames (12.6%, see\nFigure 1). Hence, this situation is more similar to a tradi-\ntional retrieval task (the desired positive class is rare), and\nprecision and recall are the relevant measures for this task.\nTable 1 shows all results, and‚Äîfor comparison‚Äîthe theo-\nrtical performance of the three classiÔ¨Åers ‚Äòrand- x‚Äô that ran-\ndomly assign a ratio of xframes to the solo class.\nThe method that includes all our novel audio features,\nFMRH, achieves the highest accuracy of all methods. How-\never, all methods show high accuracy and speciÔ¨Åcity; preci-\nsion and recall show the great differences between the meth-\nods.

The methods that\ncombine our novel features have a distinct advantage, with\nthe FMRH feature setting achieving the highest precision.\nNote, however, that the precision ranking of the individual\nfeatures is different from the vocal case, where the F fea-\nture was best and the M and R features showed very similar\nperformance: the method using the R feature alone is now\nsubstantially better than that of the simple MFCC feature M,\nsuggesting that using the isolated timbre of the solo melody\nis a decisive advantage. The F feature alone shows low pre-\ncision, which is expected because pitch Ô¨Çuctuation is high\nfor vocals as well as instrumental solos.\nConsidering that the precision of a random classiÔ¨Åer in\nthis task is 12.6% the best performance of 61.1%‚Äîthough\nnot ideal‚Äîmakes it interesting for practical applications.\nFor example, in a situation where a TV editor requires an\nexpressive instrumental as a musical backdrop to the video\nfootage, a system implementing our method could substan-\ntially reduce the amount of time needed to Ô¨Ånd suitable ex-\ncerpts.\n6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nA capability of the extended methods we have not discussed\nin this paper is to detect whether the singer in a song is\nmale or female. A simple classiÔ¨Åcation method is to take\nthe more frequent of the two cases in a track as the track-\n237Poster Session 2\nwise estimate, resulting in a 70.1% track-wise accuracy. In\nthis context, we are currently investigating hierarchical time\nseries models that allow us to represent a global song model,\ne.g. ‚Äòfemale song‚Äô, ‚Äòfemale-male duet‚Äô or ‚Äòinstrumental‚Äô. In-\nformal experiments have shown that this strategy can in-\ncrease overall accuracy, and as a side-effect it delivers a\nsong-level classiÔ¨Åcation which can be used to distinguish\nnot only whether a track‚Äôs lead vocal is male or female, but\nalso whether the song has vocals at all.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have proposed the usage of a set of four audio features\nand the new task of detecting instrumental solos in poly-\nphonic audio recordings of popular music. Among the four\nproposed audio features three are based on a prior transcrip-\ntion of the predominant melody line, and have not been used\nin the context of vocal/instrumental activity detection. We\nconducted 14 different experiments with 7 feature combina-\ntions and two different SVM-HMM models. Training and\ntesting was done using 5-fold cross-validation on a set of\n102 popular music tracks. Our results demonstrate the ben-\neÔ¨Åt of combining the four proposed features. The best per-\nformance for vocal detection is achieved by using all four\nfeatures, leading to a top accuracy of 87.2% and a satisfac-\ntory segmentation performance of 72.4%. The detection of\ninstrumental solos equally beneÔ¨Åts from the combination of\nall features. Accuracy is also high (89.8%), but we argue\nthat the main improvement through the features can be seen\nin the increase in precision to 61.1%.

INTRODUCTION\nA piece of music has many qualities that inÔ¨Çuence how it is\nperceived by human beings. These qualities include timbre,\nrhythm and harmony. One further, distinct property is the\nway in which timbre, rhythm, harmony and other features\nare temporally organised into units of various lengths over\nthe course of the piece, from the smallest note change to the\nchange between two sections. In this paper we propose an\naudio feature aimed at characterising part of this temporal,\nstructural organisation.\nA measure of structural change can be useful for mu-\nsic browsing within a track or in collections of music. In\nparticular, suitable visualisations of the feature can directly\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.be used for concise thumbnail-like descriptions of musical\npieces. As a measure of complexity, structural change lends\nitself to the exploration of the cultural evolution of music.\nParry [8] provides an overview of research in music com-\nplexity and applies several measures of complexity on sym-\nbolic music. In the audio domain, Streich [10] gives a com-\nprehensive description of existing theories and techniques.\nHe also discusses many deÔ¨Ånitions of complexity in science\nand their application to music, noting that pure information-\ntheoretical and mathematical approaches such as entropy\nand Kolmogorov complexity can limit the exploration of\nhuman-perceived complexity.\nOur approach is inspired by a biological notion of com-\nplexity [1] according to which things are deÔ¨Åned as more\ncomplex the less likely they could have come into existence\nby chance. More speciÔ¨Åcally, we focus on the aspect of dis-\ntinction, the fact that ‚Äúdifferent parts of the complex behave\ndifferently‚Äù [5]. As an example in the domain of audio, con-\nsider two ten-second waveforms: one exclusively consisting\nof pink noise, the other one consisting of Ô¨Åve seconds of\npink noise followed by Ô¨Åve seconds of white noise. Clearly,\nsomething must have happened in the middle of the second\nwaveform that resulted in this change, or, in musical terms,\nthe second piece must have had a ‚Äòcomposer‚Äô.\nIn real music, such structural changes happen in all\nmusical qualities (including rhythm and harmony), and‚Äî\nequally importantly‚Äîthey happen on all time scales within\nthe range of the length of a piece. Our proposed feature\ncaptures these structural changes at several time scales. Our\nassumption is that it correlates with the degree to which the\nmusic was composed, an indication of complexity.\nWe would like to stress that the structural change feature\nis unrelated to any instantaneous complexity listeners may\nperceive. The timbre of a complete orchestra playing the\nsame note, or the harmony of a rare jazz chord may sound\ncomplex, but our method exclusively aims at discovering the\nquantity of change.\nGiven an arbitrary audio feature (for example chroma),\ncalculated for short frames across a piece of music, our pro-\nposed method calculates a meta-feature at every frame by\n489Poster Session 4\ncomparing statistics of the feature in a window before the\ncurrent frame with statistics of a window after the current\nframe, i.e. a it compares left to right. This method resembles\nFoote‚Äôs convolution with a checkerboard kernel [2], which\nis used for structural segmentation. Our approach focuses\non the amount of change itself as a valid property of mu-\nsic. It is more similar in scope to Streich‚Äôs tonal complexity\nmeasure [10, Chapter 4], which compares the harmonic con-\ntent in one short-term window to that in a longer window.\nHowever, we are concerned with multiple time scales, and\nin order to capture the structural changes at different time\nscales this calculation is done for several different window\nsizes, resulting in a vector-valued feature.\nThere has been previous research in multi-time-\nscale analysis of audio properties, most prominently the\nkeyscapes proposed by Sapp [9] and extensions thereof [4].\nThese analyses are aimed at providing information about\nwhat classes of harmonies are present in the signal at dif-\nferent time scales. While a visualisation of these classes\nmay reveal changes in the signal, our proposed feature is\nconcerned with the amount of change in any kind of frame-\nwise audio feature. In short, our approach combines Foote‚Äôs\nmeasure of change with Sapp‚Äôs multi-time-scale approach,\nand Streich‚Äôs application to musical complexity.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Sec-\ntion 2 provides a general formulation of our proposed fea-\nture and outlines an efÔ¨Åcient implementation. In Section 3\nwe exemplify the use of the feature with three different ba-\nsis features and propose a visualisation that summarises the\nresulting structural change features for a whole track. In\nSection 5 we provide evidence for the validity of our fea-\nture based on a crowd-sourcing experiment. We discuss our\napproach and future work in Section 6.\n2. STRUCTURAL CHANGE ALGORITHM\nThis section formulates the structural change feature in\nmathematical terms and provides a description of an efÔ¨Å-\ncient implementation.\n2.1 Formulation\nThe formulation of the structural change feature is relatively\nstraight-forward. Since it is designed as a meta-feature, we\nassume that the m-dimensional audio feature vector xi‚àà\nRm, i= 1, . . . , N has been calculated for all Nframes of a\nmusic track.\nAt frame i, the idea is to compare a summary\ns[i‚àík+1:i‚àí1]‚ààRmof the features in the kframes to the\n‚Äòleft‚Äô to a summary s[i:i+k]‚ààRmof the features in the k\nframes to the ‚Äòright‚Äô.1For example, in our implementation\nbelow the summary is the mean vector.\n1The dimension of the summary does not have to be the same mas that\nof the feature, but we use it here for simplicity.We also assume that we have a non-negative divergence\nfunction d:Rm√óRm‚ÜíR+that assigns a divergence\nto a pair of feature summaries, for example the Euclidean\ndistance or the Jenson-Shannon divergence (as in our im-\nplementation, see Section 3.2). Effectively, dwill compare\nthe windows to the left and right of the ithframe.\nThe characteristic of the structural change feature is that\nit samples the divergence of the left and right windows at\ndifferent window sizes wj, j= 1, . . . , n . The structural\nchange feature at the ithframe is the n-dimensional vector\nvi=/parenleftbig\nv1\ni, . . . , vn\ni/parenrightbig\nof the resulting divergences, where\nvj\ni=Ô£±\nÔ£¥Ô£≤\nÔ£¥Ô£≥d(s[i‚àíwj+1:i‚àí1], s[i:i+wj]),\nifwj< i < N‚àíwj+ 1\n0 otherwise.\n(1)\nWhile the window widths are arbitrary, it is convenient to\nthink of them as increasing. For example, one possibility is\nto use window widths increasing by powers of 2:\nwj= 2j‚àí1. (2)\nUsing several large windows increases the number of com-\nputations, an issue which we address below.\n2.2 An efÔ¨Åcient implementation strategy\nCalculation of the structural change is relatively costly be-\ncause 2nsummaries s[.:.]have to be calculated at every\nframe, two for every window width. Even in the case\nwhere the summary is simply the mean of the feature vec-\ntors‚Äô elements over time computations can become expen-\nsive: calculating the sums (required for the means) leads to\n2mN/summationtextn\nj=1(wj‚àí1) = 2 mnN (W‚àí1)additions for the\nwhole track, where Wis the average window width. For a\nfeature with m= 12 dimensions, a track with N= 2500\nframes, n= 8different window widths and an average win-\ndow size of W= 100 these are nearly 48 million additions.\nHowever, when the summary function is indeed the mean,\nthen we can calculate every single summary as just one vec-\ntor difference ( mdifferences)\ns[i1:i2] =ci2‚àíci1 (3)\nof two vectors from the cumulative feature matrix C=\n(c0, . . . ,cN). The matrix Ccan be easily pre-calculated\nas\nci=i/summationdisplay\ni/prime=0xi/prime, (4)\nwhere we set x0=0. Pre-calculating Cis cheap, it costs\nnNadditions, and the additions performed during the struc-\ntural change calculations are reduced to 2mnN , i.e. by a\nfactor of W. We have implemented the algorithm in C++\nas a library that can be directly included into Vamp feature\n49012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nplugins2. The source code for this library can be obtained\nfrom http://github.com/lastfm/ .\nThe window sizes from Equation (2), the mean summary\nfunction and the Jenson-Shannon divergence are used in our\nexample implementation below, which represents one par-\nticular possibility of conÔ¨Åguring the algorithm.\n3. IMPLEMENTATION WITH\nTHREE BASIS FEATURES\nWe apply the structural change algorithm to three differ-\nent features chosen to represent three qualities of music:\nchroma (harmony), rhythm and timbre. This section de-\nscribes the design choices we have made to achieve this.\n3.1 The Basis Features\nFor each of the qualities described by the basis features‚Äî\nchroma, rhythm and timbre‚Äîwe separately extract the\nstructural change features (SC) as described in Section 2:\nchroma SC, rhythm SC and timbre SC. All features are ex-\ntracted from mp3 Ô¨Åles sampled at 44100 kHz.\nChroma. Chroma [3] is a 12-dimensional feature of\nactivity values pertaining to the twelve pitch classes (C,\nC/sharp, . . . , B), a representation of the instantaneous harmony.\nWe use an existing Vamp plugin implementation3. The\nmethod [6] makes use of the discrete Fourier transform to\nobtain a spectrogram, maps every spectral frame to the log-\nfrequency space (pitch space) via a linear transform and up-\ndates the values to adjust for tuning differences; the chroma\nvectors are weighted sums of the adjusted pitch space spec-\ntral bins. We do not use the approximate transcription\n(NNLS) step but otherwise use the default parameters with\na step size of 11025 samples (250 ms).\nRhythm. The Ô¨Çuctuation patterns (FP) feature [7] was\ndesigned to describe the rhythmic signature of musical au-\ndio. The FPs are calculated on Hamming-windowed seg-\nments of approximately 3 seconds length, with a step size of\none second (44100 samples), which are further sub-divided\ninto 256 frames with a length of 512 samples. The main\nidea is to use the dB amplitude of these 256 frames at dif-\nferent frequency bands as a time series: the spectrum of this\ntime series at a particular frequency band is the FP of that\nfrequency band. We sum the FPs of all frequency bands into\none band in order to eliminate timbre inÔ¨Çuence.\nTimbre. The Mel-spectrum is a warped frequency spec-\ntrum obtained by taking the discrete Fourier transform of an\naudio signal, taking the logarithm of the spectral energies\nto obtain dB values, and mapping the spectrum onto Mel-\nfrequency spaced bins that are linear with respect to human\npitch perception. We use 36 Mel-frequency bins. Since the\nfeature is extracted together with the FP, the hop size is one\n2http://www.vamp-plugins.org/\n3http://isophonics.net/nnls-chromasecond and the spectral bins are means taken over 256 small\nframes (512 samples) across a 3 second window.\n3.2 Window, Summary and Divergence Functions\nWe choose power-of-two window widths (Equation 2). In\norder to align time-scales we set j= 1, . . . , 6for both\nrhythm and timbre features, and j= 3, . . . , 8for the chroma\nfeature. This means that the structural change feature is 6-\ndimensional with window widths (i.e. those of the left or\nright windows) are 1, 2, 4, . . ., 32 seconds.\nWe use the mean summary function s, which is imple-\nmented as described in Section 2.2. Since all basis fea-\ntures can be interpreted as distributions in their respective\ndomains, we normalise each summary vector, and use the\nJenson-Shannon divergence as our divergence measure d,\ni.e. for two normalised summary vectors s1ands2\nd(s1, s2) =KL(s1||M) +KL(s2||M)\n2(5)\nwhere M=s1+s2\n2and KL is the Kullback-Leibler diver-\ngence given by\nKL(x||y) =n/summationdisplay\ni=1xilog(xi/yi). (6)\n3.3 An Example\nWe have marked a few interesting aspects of the structural\nchange features for the song ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô in Figure 1 (light\ncolours mean high values). The labels amark two drum\nstops, before the Ô¨Årst chorus and the Ô¨Årst bridge, respec-\ntively. Timbre and rhythm SC both show a double bulge,\nespecially in the three bins of short time scales, one at the\nbeginning and one at the end of each drum stop. At bonly\nthe timbre SC shows a high value, indicating the beginning\nof the second chorus (without a clear rhythm change). La-\nbelcmarks a part with little musical movement: no actual\nchord changes, but lots of sound variation, including spo-\nken voice excerpts: this is reÔ¨Çected in relatively low chroma\nSC activity, but relatively high timbre SC activity. Label d\nmarks a calm bridge section (no drums), followed by the\nkey change that leads into the next chorus. Two clear timbre\nSC peaks show the boundaries of the bridge, and the high\nchroma long-scale SC values reÔ¨Çect the key change.\n4. TRACK-LEVEL SUMMARISATION AND\nVISUALISATION\nIn some contexts it is useful to be able to summarise the\nstructural change of a piece of music, for example, sum-\nmarising the feature for further processing by machine\nlearning algorithms. Summarisation is also necessary to\ngenerate track-level visualisations, such as the Audio Flow-\ners, which we present below.\n491Poster Session 4\naabcdtime scaletime scaletime scale\n     timechroma SCtimbre SCrhythm SCFigure 1 : Structural change in the three basis features for the song ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô as performed by Britney Spears. See Section 3.3.\n4.1 Statistics\nThe most straight-forward way of summarising the SC\nframes is to take the mean average over all structural change\nfeature frames of the whole piece, resulting in one mean fea-\nture vector. In cases where structural change is concentrated\nin a small part of the piece of music, however, the mean can\nbe misleading because it suggests that the rate of change in\nthe whole piece is relatively high. The median is a more ro-\nbust average statistic, since it discards such outliers. We use\nboth because mean, median and their difference are interest-\ning properties of a piece of music.\nWe extracted the structural change features for our three\nbasis features from mp3 Ô¨Åles of 17,116 pieces of popular\nfrom the British singles charts between 1951 and 2011, then\naveraged them in two ways by taking the mean and median\nover time. Since we have six window widths, three basis\nfeatures and two averages for each of the combinations, each\nof the tracks has 6√ó3√ó2 = 36 values. For each of the\n36 dimensions we apply quantile normalisation (normalised\nranking) to spread values within the interval [0,1]with re-\nspect to the whole collection of songs.\n4.2 Audio Flowers\nIn order to turn the 36 values for each track into an intuitive\nvisual representation (examples in Figure 3), we treat each\nmusical quality separately to create a Ô¨Çower ‚Äòpetal‚Äô: red for\nrhythm, green for harmony, and blue for timbre. In any of\nthe three petals, the central, opaque part visualises the nor-\nmalised median values, the translucent part corresponds to\nthe normalised mean. The values closest to the centre of the\nAudio Flower represent short time scales, the values near\nthe tips of the petals represent the longest time scale. The\nplot is realised by calculating a 100-point smoothed inter-polation of the six values. We chose the median to be used\nfor the opaque part because it is a robust average of a track‚Äôs\nstructural change and is likely to be the most reliable mea-\nsure. The translucent part is only visible where the mean ex-\nceeds the median value. This happens in cases when strong\nstructural changes happen, but on a relatively short section\nof a track, as we will illustrate below.\nFigure 2 shows the results for a few artiÔ¨Åcially con-\nstructed pieces of audio. Figure 2a illustrates 300 seconds of\npink noise, Figure 2b 150 seconds of pink noise followed by\nanother 150 of white noise. The white noise Audio Flower\nshows virtually no sign of structural change, while the Au-\ndio Flower of the mixed pink and white noise Ô¨Åle has a slight\nbulge indicating a rare long-term change in timbre (the cor-\nresponding rhythm value is slightly raised, too). This in-\ndication of ‚Äòcomposedness‚Äô, or complexity, is exactly what\nwe would expect in that situation ( cf.Section 1). The other\ntwo Audio Flowers are closer to real music: Figure 2c rep-\nresents a single chord, played on a piano but with two differ-\nent rhythms alternating at a relativley long time scale of (24\nseconds). As we could expect, here too, harmonic change is\nvirtually absent, and the high values towards the tip of the\nred rhythm petal reÔ¨Çects the long-term rhythm changes. The\nchange in timbre that comes with the rhythm change can be\nobserved, too. Figure 2d was produced from a piece of mu-\nsic with the same rhythm structure, but instead of a single\nchord we used a cadence, i.e. a more complex chord pattern.\nThe Audio Flower represents this added complexity as high\nvalues towards the origin of the green harmony petal, while\nthe rest of the Ô¨Çower remains virtually unchanged.\nFigure 3a shows the Audio Flower of the song ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô,\nwhich we have already treated in Figure 1. The key change\nhappens only once during the piece, indicated through the\nhigh levels of chroma SC at din Figure 1.

The most\nstriking aspect of this song is the mushroom-shaped timbre\npetal (blue). This is common in songs that are organised\nalternating soft and loud sections.\nIn comparison, the timbre petal of the Audio Flowers in\nFigures 3c and 3d is decidedly thicker, especially at shorter\ntimescales (towards the origin). In fact, the shape of tim-\nbre and chroma petals is very similar between these two\nAudio Flowers. This is not surprising because they are in-\ndeed two renditions of the same song ‚ÄòTime After Time‚Äô,\none by Cyndi Lauper, one by Ronan Keating. The shape of\nthe rhythm petal is, however, quite dissimilar, which sug-\ngests their approaches to rhythm are different. A gallery\nof further examples can be found at http://last.fm/\nplayground/demo/complexity .\n5. INTERNET-BASED EXPERIMENT\nFinding evidence to support our hypothesis that our features\ncorrespond with human perception of structural change is\nhard because unless the listeners are musicians we cannot\n(a) Lucky\n (b) Smells Like Teen Spirit\n(c) Time After Time (Lauper)\n (d) Time After Time (Keating)\nFigure 3 : Audio Flowers for the songs (a) ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô (as per-\nformed by Britney Spears), (b) ‚ÄòSmells Like Teen Spirit‚Äô,\nand two renditions of ‚ÄòTime After Time‚Äô, (c) by Cyndi Lau-\nper, (d) by Ronan Keating.\nassume that they even think in terms of harmony, rhythm\nor timbre. In order to test whether any correlation can be\nobserved we set up an informal experiment on an Internet\npage. A participant would randomly be given two 30 second\nsound excerpts from our collection of chart singles and was\nthen asked to decide which changed more in terms of one\nof our three basis features. The tracks were chosen to dif-\nfer in their amount of structural change: the average of the\nnormalised median structural change values4for one track\nwas high ( >0.7) and that of the other one was low ( <0.3).\nThe web page clearly states that we look for change and di-\nversity. Upon casting their rating the listener is shown the\nAudio Flowers of the two songs in question as a reward and\nis told which of the two our analysis deemed more change-\nable. The rating was realised as a set of three radio-buttons\n(Ô¨Årst track, second track and a third one labelled ‚Äònot sure‚Äô).\nWe had no control over whether the participants listened to\nthe tracks before voting.\nAt the time of writing we have collected 1428 votes from\n401 raters with an mean number of 3.9 ratings (median: 2).\nWe analysed the 1165 ratings of the 197 participants who\nvoted at least three times. There is moderate agreement be-\ntween user ratings and our high and low classes: in 61.4 %\n4Taking into account the short duration of the excerpts, only the Ô¨Årst\nfour dimensions of the features were used in the structural change value.\n493Poster Session 4\nof all cases users agreed with the automatic analysis. Test-\ning against the null hypothesis of users randomly choosing\nan answer, we obtain a very low pvalue of p < 10‚àí14,\ni.e. we are very conÔ¨Ådent that the participants‚Äô choice is not\nrandom. This also applies to the three qualities separately:\nusers agree with rhythm SC (60.0%, p <10‚àí3), chroma SC\n(63.3%. p <10‚àí6) and timbre SC (60.8%, p <10‚àí4).\nIn all cases the agreement is not very high, but at this\nstage we can only speculate about the causes: our feature\nmight express something different from what we intended\nor what participants understood; the un-controlled nature\nof the experiment may have led participants to randomly\nchoose their rating; the participants may not have had the\nnecessary musical experience to provide meaningful ratings.\nHowever, the fact that we found signiÔ¨Åcant agreement for all\nthree features separately suggests that the structural change\nfeature capture musical qualities listeners can relate to.\n6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nOur implementation presented in Section 3 is only one way\nof using the structural change feature, and many can be\nadded by using alternatives for the window width func-\ntion, left/right summary function and divergence function\npresented here. We are particularly interested in exploring\ndifferent divergence functions, such as inverse correlation\nand Euclidean distance (see also [10, Chapter 4]). Using\na different divergence function will allow us to use features\nthat are not necessarily non-negative, such as mel-frequency\ncepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs) or other chroma mappings.\nThe proposed feature will allow classic Music Informa-\ntion Retrieval tasks (such as cover song retrieval and genre\nclassiÔ¨Åcation) to access a semantic dimension that is not\ncovered by existing audio features, and hence may lead to\nimprovements in these areas.\nFinally, we hope that future studies will reveal how the\nstructural change feature is related to musical complexity as\nperceived by humans.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have proposed the novel audio feature structural change\nfor the analysis of audio recordings of music. The fea-\nture can be regarded as a meta-feature, since it measures\nthe change of an underlying basis feature at different time\nscales. As part of our proposal we have presented the gen-\neral algorithm and an efÔ¨Åcient implementation strategy of a\nspecial case. We have implemented the feature with three\ndifferent basis features representing chroma, rhythm and\ntimbre. Analysing more than 17,000 tracks of popular mu-\nsic allowed us to Ô¨Ånd a meaningful normalisation to the fea-\nture values. Based on this normalisation we have introduced\na track-level visualisation of structural change in chroma,\nrhythm and timbre. Several of these visualisations, AudioFlowers, have been presented to illustrate the features‚Äô char-\nacteristics and show that interpreting the amount of struc-\ntural change as musical complexity is possible. We con-\nducted a informal web-based experiment whose results sug-\ngest that our proposed feature correlates with the human per-\nception of change in music.\n8. REFERENCES\n[1] R. Dawkins.

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK\nMusic incorporates multiple types of content: the audio it-\nself, song lyrics, album covers, social and cultural data, and\nmusic videos. All those modalities contribute to the percep-\ntion of a song, and an artist in general. However, often a\nstrong focus is put on the audio content only, disregarding\nmany other opportunities and exploitable modalities. Even\nthough music perception itself is based on sonic characteris-\ntics to a large extent, and acoustic content makes it possible\nto differentiate between acoustic styles, a great share of the\noverall perception of a song can be only explained when\nconsidering other modalities. Often, consumers relate to a\nsong for the topic of its lyrics. Some categories of songs,\nsuch as ‚Äòlove songs‚Äô or ‚ÄòChristmas‚Äô songs, are almost ex-\nclusively deÔ¨Åned by their textual domain; many traditional\n‚ÄòChristmas‚Äô songs were interpreted by modern artists and\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.heavily inÔ¨Çuenced by their style: ‚ÄòPunk Rock‚Äô variations are\nrecorded as well as ‚ÄòHip-Hop‚Äô or ‚ÄòRap‚Äô versions.\nThese examples show that there is a whole level of se-\nmantics inherent in song lyrics that can not be detected solely\nby audio based techniques. We thus assume that a song‚Äôs\ntext content can help in better understanding its perception,\nand evaluate a new approach for combining descriptors ex-\ntracted from the audio domain of music with descriptors de-\nrived from the textual content of lyrics. Our approach is\nbased on the assumption that a diversity of music descrip-\ntors and a diversity of machine learning algorithms are able\nto make further improvements.\nMusic information retrieval (MIR) is concerned with ad-\nequately accessing (digital) audio. Important research di-\nrections include similarity retrieval, musical genre classi-\nÔ¨Åcation, or music analysis and knowledge representation.\nA comprehensive overviews of the research Ô¨Åeld is given\nin [11]. The prevalent technique of music for MIR purposes\nis to analyse the audio signal. Popular feature sets include\nMFCCs, Chroma, or the MPEG-7 audio descriptors.\nPrevious studies reported about a glass ceiling being reached\nusing timbral audio features for music classiÔ¨Åcation [1]. Wev-\neral research teams have been working on analysing textual\ninformation, predominantly in the form of song lyrics and an\nabstract vector representation of the term information con-\ntained in other text documents. A semantic and structural\nanalysis of song lyrics is conducted in [8]. An evaluation of\nartist similarity via song lyrics is given in [7], suggesting a\ncombination of approaches might lead to better results.\nIn this paper, we employ feature sets derived from the\nlyrics content, capturing rhyme structures, part-of-speech of\nthe employed words, and style, such as diversiÔ¨Åcation of the\nwords used, sentence complexity, and punctuation. These\nfeature sets were introduced in [10], and applied to genre\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. This approach has further been extended to a\nbigger test collection and a combination of lyrics and audio\nfeatures in [9], reporting results superior to single feature\nsets. The combination based on simple feature fusion (early\nfusion), i.e. concatenating all feature subspaces is however\nsimplistic. Here, we rather apply late fusion , combining\nclassiÔ¨Åer outcomes rather than features. We create a two-\n675Poster Session 6\nFigure 1 . Overview of the Cartesian Ensemble System,\ncombining feature sets with a set of classiÔ¨Åcation schemes\ndimensional ensemble system, a Cartesian classiÔ¨Åer , com-\nbining different feature subspaces from different domains,\nand different classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms.\nThis paper is structured as follows. We describe the en-\nsemble approach in Section 2. We then evaluate and analyse\nits results on two corpora in Section 3. Finally, we conclude,\nand give a short outlook on future research in Section 4.\n2. CARTESIAN ENSEMBLE\nA schematic overview of the ensemble system, building on\na system introduced in [5], is given in Figure 1. The system\nis called Cartesian ensemble , as the set of models it uses\nas base classiÔ¨Åers is composed as the Cartesian product of\nDfeature subspaces/sets by CclassiÔ¨Åcation schemes. A\nmodel is built for each combination of a training classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion scheme cion a feature subspace dj, yielding a total of\nD√óCbase models as the ensemble. A classiÔ¨Åcation scheme\nis a speciÔ¨Åc classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm and parameters used.\nThe goal of the ensemble approach is two-fold. First,\nit is aimed at obtaining a sufÔ¨Åciently diverse ensemble of\nmodels, which will guarantee, up to a certain degree, an\nimprovement of the ensemble accuracy over the best single\nmodel trained. Choosing this best single model a priori is a\ndifÔ¨Åcult task, and previous results have shown that there is\nno combination of algorithm (and parameters) and features\nwhich would yield the best result for each dataset and task.\nThus, the second goal of the approach is to abstract from the\nselection of a such a particular classiÔ¨Åer and feature set to\nuse for a particular problem. When a previously unknown\npiece of music is presented to the ensemble system, the se-\nlected models each produce a prediction for a speciÔ¨Åc cat-\negory. To obtain a Ô¨Ånal result, these individual predictions\nare then combined to produce a single category prediction\noutcome. For this step, a number of different decision com-\nbination (or label fusion) rules , can be used. The Cartesian\nensemble system is built on the open-source WEKA toolkit,\nand uses classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms available therein.\nPareto-optimal ClassiÔ¨Åer Selection: Model diversity is\na key design factor for building effective classiÔ¨Åer ensem-bles [4]. The system employs a strategy for selecting the\nbest set of models , based on Ô¨Ånding the Pareto-optimal set of\nmodels by rating them in pairs, according to two measures.\nThe Ô¨Årst one is the inter-rater agreement diversity measure\nŒ∫, deÔ¨Åned on the coincidence matrix Mof the two models.\nThe entrymr,sis the proportion of the dataset that model hi\nlabels asLrand modelhjlabels asLs. The second measure\nis the pair average error, computed by\neij= 1‚àíŒ±i+Œ±j\n2(1)\nwhereŒ±iandŒ±jare the estimated accuracy of the two\nmodels. The Pareto-optimal set contains all non-dominated\npairs, i.e. pairs for which there is no other pair that is better\nthan on both criteria. For more details, pleas see [4].\nVote Combination Rules : The system provides weighted\nand unweighted vote combination rules. The unweighted\nrules employed are described e.g. in [2]. They comprise\nsimple majority voting (MAJ), which favours the class pre-\ndicted by most votes, and rules that combine the individual\nresults by the average (A VG), median (MED) or maximum\n(MAX) of the posterior probability P(Lk|xi)of instancex\nto belong to category Lk, as provided by model hi.\nTheweighted rules multiply model decisions by weights\nand select the label Lkthat gets the maximum score. Model\nweights are based on the estimated accuracy Œ±iof the trained\nmodels. The authorityaiof each model hiis established\nas a function of Œ±i, normalized, and used as its weight œâi.\nThe Simple Weighted V ote (SWV) computes weights as a\nsimple weighted vote. The more complicated weight func-\ntions for the Rescaled Simple Weighted V ote (RSWV), Best-\nWorst Weighted V ote (BWWV) and Quadratic Best-Worst\nWeighted V ote (QBWWV) are depicted in Figure 2. There,\neBis the lowest estimated number of errors made by any\nmodel in the ensemble on a given validation dataset, and\neWis the highest estimated number of errors made by any of\nthose classiÔ¨Åers. Weighted Majority V ote (WMV) is a theo-\nretically optimal weighted vote rule described in [4], where\nmodel weights are set proportionally to log(Œ±i/(1‚àíŒ±i)).\nInner/Outer Cross Validation: To estimate how the re-\nsults from a classiÔ¨Åer will generalize on independent data,\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation model is tested on labelled data which was\nnot used for training the model, and measures such as ac-\ncuracy are recorded. To reduce the variability, often a tech-\nnique called cross-validation is employed: nmultiple rounds\nof partitioning the data in a training and test set are per-\nformed, and the recorded measures are averaged over all\nthe rounds. For weighted combination rules, we need to\nestimate the accuracy of individual ensemble models ( Œ±i)\nto obtain their authorities ( ai). To avoid using test data of\nthe ensemble for single model accuracy estimation, an in-\n67612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nekekekakakak\n0 N(1‚àí1/M)1 1 1\neWeBeWeB0Figure 2 .

The predicted accuracy of this inner cross-\nvalidation is then taken as the authority of the model.\n3. EV ALUATION\nIn this section, we Ô¨Årst present the feature subspaces and\ndatasets employed in our evaluation, followed by a detailed\nanalysis of the classiÔ¨Åcation results.\n3.1 Audio Feature Subspaces\nThe audio descriptors are extracted from a spectral repre-\nsentation of an audio signal, partitioned into segments of 6\nsec. Features are extracted segment-wise, and then aggre-\ngated for a piece of music computing the median (RP, RH)\nor mean (SSD) from features of multiple segments. For de-\ntails on the computation, please refer to the literature for\ndetails [6]. The feature extraction for a Rhythm Pattern\nis composed of two stages. First, the speciÔ¨Åc loudness sen-\nsation on 24 critical frequency bands is computed through\na Short Time FFT, grouping the resulting frequency bands\nto the Bark scale, and successive transformation into the\nDecibel, Phon and Sone scales. This results in a psycho-\nacoustically modiÔ¨Åed Sonogram representation that reÔ¨Çects\nhuman loudness sensation. Then, a discrete Fourier trans-\nform is applied, resulting in a spectrum of loudness ampli-\ntude modulation per modulation frequency for each critical\nband. A Rhythm Histogram (RH) aggregates the modu-\nlation amplitude values of the critical bands computed in\na Rhythm Pattern and is a descriptor for general rhythmic\ncharacteristics in a piece of audio [6]. The Ô¨Årst part of the\nalgorithm for computation of a Statistical Spectrum De-\nscriptor (SSD), the computation of speciÔ¨Åc loudness sen-\nsation, is equal to the Rhythm Pattern algorithm. Subse-\nquently at set of statistical valuesare calculated for each indi-\nvidual critical band. SSDs describe Ô¨Çuctuations on the crit-\nical bands and capture additional timbral information very\nwell [6].\n3.2 Lyrics Feature Subspace\nThe following feature subspaces are all based on song lyrics,\nand analyse the content, and rhyme and style of them. For\nmore details on features please refer to [10] [9]. To account\nfor different document lengths, where applicable, values arenormalised by the number of words or lines of the lyrics\ndocument.\n3.2.1 Topic Features\nFor analysing the topical content of the lyrics, we rely on\nclassical bag-of-words indexing, which uses a set of words\nto represent each document. Let the number of documents\nin a collection be denoted by N, each single document by d,\nand a term or token by t. Accordingly, the term frequency\ntf(t,d)is the number of occurrences of term tin document\ndand the document frequency df(t)the number of docu-\nments termtappears in. We then apply weights to the terms,\naccording to their importance or signiÔ¨Åcance for the docu-\nment, using the popular model of term frequency times in-\nverse document frequency .This results in vectors of weight\nvalues for each document din the collection, i.e. each lyrics\ndocument. We do not perform stemming in this setup, ear-\nlier experiments showed only negligible differences for stemmed\nand non-stemmed features (the rationale behind using non-\nstemmed terms is the occurrence of slang language in some\ngenres).\n3.2.2 Rhyme and Style Features\nRhyme denotes the consonance or similar sound of two or\nmore syllables or whole words. The motivation for this\nset of features was that different genres of music should\nexhibit different styles of lyrics and rhymes. ‚ÄòHip-Hop‚Äô\nor ‚ÄòRap‚Äô music, for instance, makes heavy use of rhymes,\nwhich (along with a dominant bass) leads to their character-\nistic sound. To identify such patterns we extract several de-\nscriptors from the phoneme transcription of the song lyrics.\nWe then distinguish two elements of subsequent lines in a\nsong text: AAandAB. The former represents two rhyming\nlines, while the latter denotes non-rhyming. Based on these,\nwe extract a set of rhyme patterns, such as a sequence of two\n(or more) rhyming lines (‚ÄòCouplet‚Äô), alternating rhymes, or\nsequences of rhymes with a nested sequence (‚ÄòEnclosing\nrhyme‚Äô), and count their frequency. Subsequently, we com-\npute the percentage of rhyming blocks, and deÔ¨Åne the unique\nrhyme words as the fraction of unique terms used to build\nrhymes, describing whether rhymes are frequently formed\nusing the same word pairs.\nPart-of-speech (POS) tagging is a lexical categorisation\nor grammatical tagging of words. Different POS categories\nare e.g. nouns, verbs, articles or adjectives. We presume that\ndifferent genres will differ also in the category of words they\nare using; thus, we extract several POS descriptors from the\nlyrics. We count the numbers of: nouns ,verbs ,pronouns ,\nrelational pronouns (such as ‚Äòthat‚Äô or ‚Äòwhich‚Äô), prepositions ,\nadverbs ,articles ,modals , and adjectives .\nText documents can also be described by simple statisti-\ncal style measures based on word or character frequencies.\nMeasures such as the average length of words or the ratio\n677Poster Session 6\nof unique words in the vocabulary might give an indication\nof the complexity of the texts, and are expected to vary over\ndifferent genres. Further, the usage of punctuation marks\nsuch as exclamation or question marks may be speciÔ¨Åc for\nsome genres, and some genres might make increased use\nof apostrophes when omitting the correct spelling of word\nendings. Other features describe the words per line and the\nunique number of words per line, the ratio of the number\nof unique words and the total number of words, and the av-\nerage number of characters per word. A particular feature\nis words-per-minute, which is computed analogously to the\nwell-known beats-per-minute (BPM) value.\n3.3 Datasets\nMusic information retrieval research in general suffers from\na lack of standardised benchmark collections ‚Äì being mainly\nattributable to copyright issues. Nonetheless, some collec-\ntions have been used frequently in the literature, such as the\ntwo collections provided for the ‚Äòrhythm‚Äô and ‚Äògenre‚Äô re-\ntrieval tasks held in conjunction with the ISMIR conference\n2004, or the collection presented in [12].\nHowever, for the Ô¨Årst two collections, hardly any lyrics\nare available as they are either instrumental songs or free\nmusic for which lyrics were not published. For the latter, no\nmeta-data such as song titles is available, making automatic\nfetching of lyrics impossible. The collection used in [3] con-\nsists of only 260 pieces and was not initially used for genre\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. Further, it was compiled from only about 20\ndifferent artists ‚Äì we speciÔ¨Åcally wanted to avoid uninten-\ntionally classifying artists rather than genres.\nTherefore, we constructed two different test collections\nof differing size as a random sample from a private collec-\ntion [9]. The Ô¨Årst database consists of 600 songs, aimed\nat having a high number of different artists, with songs from\ndifferent albums to prevent biased results by too many songs\nfrom the same artist/album. It thus comprises songs from\n159 different artists and 241 different albums. They are or-\nganised in ten genres of 60 songs each (cf. left part of Ta-\nble 1). To conÔ¨Årm the Ô¨Åndings from the smaller test col-\nlection, we created a larger, more diversiÔ¨Åed database of\nmedium- to large-scale, consisting of 3,010 songs.The num-\nbers of songs per genre range from 179 in ‚ÄòFolk‚Äô to 381\nin ‚ÄòHip-Hop‚Äô. Detailed Ô¨Ågures about this collection can be\ntaken from the right part of Table 1. To be able to better re-\nlate and match the results obtained for the smaller collection,\nwe only selected songs belonging to the same ten genres.\nWe then automatically fetched lyrics from popular lyrics\nportals on the Internet. In case the primary portal didn‚Äôt pro-\nvide any lyrics, the other portals were used until all lyrics\nwere available. No checking of the quality of the texts with\nrespect to content or structure was performed; thus, the lyrics\ncan be considered a representative data source a simple au-\ntomated system could retrieve.Table 1 .

For statistical signiÔ¨Åcant testing, we used a paired t-\ntest (Œ±=0.05, micro-averaged accuracy); in the tables, im-\nprovement or degradation over datasets (column-wise) is in-\ndicated by ( +) or (‚àí), respectively.\nTable 2 shows the classiÔ¨Åcation results of the single clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers on single feature sets on the small dataset . It can\nbe noted that the SSD features are the best performing sin-\ngle feature set, and the SVM the best classiÔ¨Åer; here, the\nlinear kernel performed better than the quadratic. This com-\nbination of feature set and classiÔ¨Åcation scheme thus serves\nas the primary base-line to compare the Cartesian ensem-\nble results to. The results of the SSD features clearly out-\nperform the other audio feature sets (RH omitted, cf. [9]),\nby 10% points and more. k-NN is the second-best clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation algorithm, achieving 52.17% accuracy with a k\nof 1 on SSD features, outperforming both Random Forests\nand Na ¬®ƒ±ve Bayes. Regarding the lyrics features, the text\nstatistics features perform best from the rhyme and style\nfeatures, achieving 30% accuracy. The text statistics fea-\ntures are slightly outperformed by the bag-of-words features\nwhen using the linear SVM, and signiÔ¨Åcantly on Na ¬®ƒ±ve Bayes,\nwhile they perform signiÔ¨Åcantly worse on k-NN, Random\nForests and the quadratic SVM.\nFurther, Table 2 also gives the set of best-performing\ncombinations of concatenating the single feature sets (early\nfusion). They are assumed as a secondary baseline for the\nensemble. Compared to the single feature sets, when com-\nbining SSD and lyrics style statistics features, we could sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly improve the result, by almost 7% points. We can\nalso observe that the improvement is not of statistical signif-\nicance for the other classiÔ¨Åcation schemes.

It has to be noted that Ô¨Ånding this best\nfeature fusion result requires testing a number of different\nfeature combinations, as well as testing a lot of different\nalgorithms. This is a time-consuming and labour-intensive\ntask, as well as it is computationally expensive.\nThe results on the large dataset given in Table 4, in-\ncluding bag-of-words feature sets with different number of\nfeatures selected by simple document frequency threshold-\ning. SSD was again clearly the best audio feature set, clearly\noutperforming the RP features by more than 14% on the best\nSSD classiÔ¨Åer than on the best RP classiÔ¨Åer (SVM quadratic\nand SVM linear, respectively). However, it is worth to note\nthat on this dataset, the quadratic SVM kernel on SSD per-\nformed with 69.43% signiÔ¨Åcantly better than the linear one\nwith 66.37%, which was the best kernel on the small database.We can further note that text statistics are again the best fea-\nture of the rhyme and style features, reaching almost 30%\npoints with SVMs. The bag-of-words features, however,\nyield much better results than that, with 42.47% when us-\ning the linear SVM kernel and 8270 content terms. We can\nachieve almost 40% accuracy also with the Na ¬®ƒ±ve Bayes al-\ngorithm, while Random Forests and k-NN predict much less\ncorrectly classiÔ¨Åed instances.\nRegarding the results with early fusion, while we could\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly improve the linear Kernel on SSD features by\nconcatenating them with the lyrics features, the improve-\nments for the quadratic kernel are a bit less. It is also inter-\nesting to note that the better combination is with the rhyme\nand style features yields better results than adding the bag-\nof-words, even though the bag-of-words alone had more\nthan 12% points better accuracy results. When using our\nnovel result (late) fusion approach, results for which are\nshown in Table 3, we can achieve classiÔ¨Åcation accuracies\nwhich are in absolute numbers up to 5% points better than\nwith the best concatenation approach, which is statistically\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly better. In numbers, the improvement is from\n69.43% as the best result with SSD features to 74.08% as\nthe best ensemble result. It can be noted that the best com-\nbination rules RSWV , BWWV , and QBWWV all show al-\nmost the same accuracy, thus relying on any of those seems\nfeasible.\nAs a further baseline to the ensembles of multiple fea-\ntures, an ensemble of the above mentioned classiÔ¨Åcation\nschemes on SSD features only is given in Table 3. This base-\nline is to test whether the improvements reported above are\nachieved due to the use of different schemes, or only when\nalso using different feature sets. As the ensemble on SSD-\nonly features improves just 0.5% point over the best single\nresults, while the performance is 3 to 4% point better than\nthat baseline when using all feature sets, it can be concluded\nthat the gain in accuracy is largely due to the Cartesian en-\nsemble of both feature subspaces and algorithms.\n679Poster Session 6\nTable 4 .

CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented an approach for multi-modal classiÔ¨Åcation of\nmusic. Contrary to earlier work on fusion of feature sub-\nspaces, the approach is built on classiÔ¨Åer ensemble tech-\nniques, i.e. fusion of the labels assigned by each single clas-\nsiÔ¨Åer. We evaluated the method by musical genre classiÔ¨Å-\ncation on two different datasets. We achieved better results\nthan when using the single feature sets alone, and for the\nlarger dataset also better results than with the best concate-\nnation approach. These improvements are up to 6% points\nabove the baseline, and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\nWe observed that the combination of the best performing\nfeature set and classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm can vary on different\ndatasets; even the choice of a different kernel for the SVM\nclassiÔ¨Åer yielded very different results on the small and large\ndataset. Using the ensemble approach, we can release the\nuser from having to make this choice explicitly, or from us-\ning computationally expensive approaches like model selec-\ntion. We have concluded from our experiments that a num-\nber of combination rules is promising, and the QBWWV\nmethod seems to show the overall best results.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nNearest neighbor computations lie at the heart of many\ncontent-based approaches to music information retrieval prob-\nlems, such as playlist generation [4, 14], classiÔ¨Åcation and\nannotation [12, 18] and recommendation [15]. Typically,\neach item ( e.g., song, clip, or artist) is represented as a point\nin some high-dimensional space, e.g.,Rdequipped with Eu-\nclidean distance or Gaussian mixture models equipped with\nKullback-Leibler divergence.\nFor large music databases, nearest neighbor techniques\nface an obvious limitation: computing the distance from a\nquery point to each element of the database becomes pro-\nhibitively expensive. However, for many tasks, approximate\nnearest neighbors may sufÔ¨Åce. This observation has moti-\nvated the development of general-purpose data structures\nwhich exploit metric structure to locate neighbors of a query\nin sub-linear time [1, 9, 10].\nIn this work, we investigate the efÔ¨Åciency and accuracy\nof several modern variants of KD-trees [1] for answering\nnearest neighbor queries for musical content. As we will\ndemonstrate, these spatial trees are simple to construct, and\ncan provide substantial improvements in retrieval time while\nmaintaining satisfactory performance.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.2. RELATED WORK\nContent-based similarity search has received a considerable\namount of attention in recent years, but due to the obvious\ndata collection barriers, relatively little of it has focused on\nretrieval in large-scale collections.\nCai, et al. [4] developed an efÔ¨Åcient query-by-example\naudio retrieval system by applying locality sensitive hashing\n(LSH) [9] to a vector space model of audio content. Although\nLSH provides strong theoretical guarantees on retrieval per-\nformance in sub-linear time, realizing those guarantees in\npractice can be challenging. Several parameters must be care-\nfully tuned ‚Äî the number of bins in each hash, the number\nof hashes, the ratio of near andfardistances, and collision\nprobabilities ‚Äî and the resulting index structure can become\nquite large due to the multiple hashing of each data point.\nCai, et al.‚Äôs implementation scales to upwards of 105audio\nclips, but since their focus was on playlist generation, they\ndid not report the accuracy of nearest neighbor recall.\nSchnitzer, et al. developed a Ô¨Ålter-and-reÔ¨Åne system to\nquickly approximate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nbetween timbre models [17]. Each song was summarized by\na multivariate Gaussian distribution over MFCC vectors, and\nthen mapped into a low-dimensional Euclidean vector space\nvia the FastMap algorithm [10], so that Euclidean distance\napproximates the symmetrized KL divergence between song\nmodels. To retrieve nearest neighbors for a query song, the\napproximate distances are computed from the query to each\npoint in the database by a linear scan (the Ô¨Ålter step). The\nclosest points are then reÔ¨Åned by computing the full KL\ndivergence to the query. This approach exploits the fact that\nlow-dimensional Euclidean distances are much cheaper to\ncompute than KL-divergence, and depending on the size of\nthe Ô¨Ålter set, can produce highly accurate results. However,\nsince the Ô¨Ålter step computes distance to the entire database,\nit requiresO(n)work, and performance may degrade if the\ndatabase is too large to Ô¨Åt in memory.\n3. SPATIAL TREES\nSpatial trees are a family of data structures which recursively\nbisect a data setX ‚äÇ Rdofnpoints in order to facilitate\nefÔ¨Åcient (approximate) nearest neighbor retrieval [1,19]. The\nrecursive partitioning of Xresults in a binary tree, where\n55Poster Session 1\nFigure 1 .

At the root of the tree lies the entire set X, and\neach nodetdeÔ¨Ånes a subset of its parent.\nA generic algorithm to construct partition trees is listed as\nAlgorithm 1. The set X‚äÇRdis projected onto a direction\nwt‚ààRd, and split at the median btinto subsetsX/lscriptandXr:\nsplitting at the median ensures that the tree remains balanced.\nThis process is then repeated recursively on each subset, until\na speciÔ¨Åed tree depth Œ¥is reached.\nSpatial trees offer several appealing properties. They are\nsimple to implement, and require minimal parameter-tuning:\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, only the maximum tree depth Œ¥, and the rule for\ngenerating split directions. Moreover, they are efÔ¨Åcient to\nconstruct and use for retrieval. While originally developed\nfor use in metric spaces, the framework has been recently\nextended to support general Bregman divergences (including,\ne.g., KL-divergence) [5]. However, for the remainder of\nthis article, we will focus on building trees for vector space\nmodels ( Rdwith Euclidean distance).\nIn order for Algorithm 1 to be fully speciÔ¨Åed, we must\nprovide a function split(X)which determines the split di-\nrectionw. Several splitting rules have been proposed in theliterature, and our experiments will cover the four described\nby Verma, et al. [20]: maximum variance KD, principal\ndirection (PCA), 2-means, and random projection.\n3.1 Maximum variance KD-tree\nThe standard KD-tree ( k-dimensional tree) chooses wby cy-\ncling through the standard basis vectors ei(i‚àà{1,2,...,d}),\nso that at level jin the tree, the split direction is w=ei+1\nwithi=jmodd[1]. The standard KD-tree can be effec-\ntive for low-dimensional data, but it is known to perform\npoorly in high dimensions [16, 20]. Note also that if n<2d,\nthere will not be enough data to split along every coordinate,\nso some (possibly informative) features may never be used\nby the data structure.\nA common Ô¨Åx to this problem is to choose was the coor-\ndinate which maximally spreads the data [20]:\nsplitKD(X) = argmax\nei/summationdisplay\nx‚ààX/parenleftbig\neT\ni(x‚àí¬µ)/parenrightbig2, (1)\nwhere¬µis the sample mean vector of X. Intuitively, this\nsplit rule picks the coordinate which provides the greatest\nreduction in variance (increase in concentration).\nThe maximum variance coordinate can be computed with\na single pass overXby maintaining a running estimate of the\nmean vector and coordinate-wise variance, so the complexity\nof computing splitKD(X)isO(dn).\n3.2 PCA-tree\nThe KD split rule ( Eqn. (1) ) is limited to axis-parallel direc-\ntionsw. The principal direction (or principal components\nanalysis, PCA) rule generalizes this to choose the direction\nw‚ààRdwhich maximizes the variance, i.e., the leading\neigenvectorvof the sample covariance matrix /hatwideŒ£:\nsplitPCA(X) = argmax\nvvT/hatwideŒ£vs.t./bardblv/bardbl2= 1.(2)\nBy using the full covariance matrix to choose the split direc-\ntion, the PCA rule may be more effective than KD-tree at\nreducing the variance at each split in the tree.\n/hatwideŒ£can be estimated from a single pass over X, so (assum-\ningn>d ) the time complexity of splitPCAisO(d2n).\n3.3 2-means\nUnlike the KD and PCA rules, which try to maximally re-\nduce variance with each split, the 2-means rule produces\nsplits which attempt preserve cluster structure. This is ac-\ncomplished by running the k-means algorithm on Xwith\nk= 2, and deÔ¨Åning wto be the direction spanned by the\ncluster centroids c1,c2‚ààRd:\nsplit2M(X) =c1‚àíc2. (3)\nWhile this general strategy performs well in practice [13],\nit can be costly to compute a full k-means solution. In our\nexperiments, we instead use an online k-means variant which\nruns inO(dn)time [3].\n5612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3.4 Random projection\nThe Ô¨Ånal splitting rule we will consider is to simply take a\ndirection uniformly at random from the unit sphere Sd‚àí1:\nsplitRP(X)‚àºUSd‚àí1, (4)\nwhich can equivalently be computed by normalizing a sample\nfrom the multivariate Gaussian distribution N(0,Id). The\nrandom projection rule is simple to compute and adapts to\nthe intrinsic dimensionality of the data X[8].\nIn practice, the performance of random projection trees\ncan be improved by independently sampling mdirections\nwi‚àº Sd‚àí1, and returning the wiwhich maximizes the\ndecrease in data diameter after splitting [20]. Since a full\ndiameter computation would take O(dn2)time, we instead\nreturn the direction which maximizes the projected diameter :\nargmax\nwimax\nx1,x2‚ààXwT\nix1‚àíwT\nix2. (5)\nThis can be computed in a single pass over Xby tracking the\nmaximum and minimum of wT\nixin parallel for all wi, so the\ntime complexity of splitRPisO(mdn). Typically, m‚â§d,\nsosplitRPis comparable in complexity to splitPCA.\n3.5 Spill trees\nThe main drawback of partition trees is that points near the\ndecision boundary become isolated from their neighbors\nacross the partition. Because data concentrates near the\nmean after (random) projection [8], hard partitioning can\nhave detrimental effects on nearest neighbor recall for a large\npercentage of queries.\nSpill trees remedy this problem by allowing overlap be-\ntween the left and right subtrees [13]. If a point lies close\nto the median, then it will be added to both subtrees, thus\nreducing the chance that it becomes isolated from its neigh-\nbors ( Figure 2 ). This is accomplished by maintaining two\ndecision boundaries b/lscript\ntandbr\nt. IfwT\ntx>br\nt, thenxis added\nto the right tree, and if wT\ntx‚â§b/lscript\nt, it is added to the left. The\ngap between b/lscript\ntandbr\ntcontrols the amount of data which\nspills across the split.\nThe algorithm to construct a spill tree is listed as Algo-\nrithm 2. The algorithm requires a spill threshold œÑ‚àà[0,1/2):\nrather than splitting at the median (so that a set of nitems\nis split into subsets of size roughly n/2), the data is split at\nthe(1/2+œÑ)-quantile, so that each subset has size roughly\nn(1/2+œÑ).

For a novel query q‚ààRd\n(i.e., a previously unseen point), these sets can be found by\nAlgorithm 3.\nThe total time required to retrieve kneighbors for a novel\nqueryqcan be computed as follows. First, note that for a spill\ntree with threshold œÑ, each split reduces the size of the set\nby a factor of (1/2+œÑ), so the leaf sets of a depth- Œ¥tree are\nexponentially small in Œ¥:n(1/2+œÑ)Œ¥. Note thatŒ¥‚â§logn,\nand is typically chosen so that the leaf set size lies in some\nreasonable range ( e.g., between 100 and 1000 items).\nNext, observe that in general, Algorithm 3 may map the\nqueryqto somehdistinct leaves, so the total size of the\nretrieval set is at most n/prime=hn(1/2+œÑ)Œ¥(although it may be\nconsiderably smaller if the sets overlap).

EXPERIMENTS\nOur song data was taken from the Million Song Dataset\n(MSD) [2]. Before describing the tree evaluation experi-\nments, we will brieÔ¨Çy summarize the process of constructing\nthe underlying acoustic feature representation.\n4.1 Audio representation\nThe audio content representation was developed on the 1%\nMillion Song Subset (MSS), and is similar to the model pro-\nposed in [15]. From each MSS song, we extracted the time\nseries of Echo Nest timbre descriptors (ENTs). This results in\na sample of approximately 8.5 million 12-dimensional ENTs,\nwhich were normalized by z-scoring according to the esti-\nmated mean and variance of the sample, randomly permuted,\nand then clustered by online k-means to yield 512 acoustic\ncodewords. Each song was summarized by quantizing each\nof its (normalized) ENTs and counting the frequency of each\ncodeword, resulting in a 512-dimensional histogram vector.\nEach codeword histogram was mapped into a probability\nproduct kernel (PPK) space [11] by square-rooting its entries,\nwhich has been demonstrated to be effective on similar audio\nrepresentations [15]. Finally, we appended the song‚Äôs tempo,\nloudness, and key conÔ¨Ådence, resulting in a vector vi‚ààR515\nfor each song xi.Next, we trained an optimized similarity metric over audio\ndescriptors. First, we computed target similarity for each\npair of MSS artists by the Jaccard index between their user\nsets in a sample of Last.fm1collaborative Ô¨Ålter data [6,\nchapter 3]. Tracks by artists with fewer than 30 listeners\nwere discarded. Next, all remaining artists were partitioned\ninto a training (80%) and validation (20%) set, and for each\nartist, we computed its top 10 most similar training artists.\nHaving constructed a training and validation set, the dis-\ntance metric was optimized by applying the metric learning\nto rank (MLR) algorithm on the training set of 4455 songs,\nand tuning parameters C‚àà{105,106,..., 109}and‚àÜ‚àà\n{AUC, MRR, MAP, Prec@10 }to maximize AUC score on\nthe validation set of 1110 songs. Finally, the resulting metric\nWwas factored by PCA (retaining 95% spectral mass) to\nyield a linear projection L‚ààR222√ó515.\nThe projection matrix Lwas then applied to each viin\nMSD. As a result, each MSD song was mapped into R222\nsuch that Euclidean distance is optimized by MLR to retrieve\nsongs by similar artists.\n4.2 Representation evaluation\nTo verify that the optimized vector quantization (VQ) song\nrepresentation carries musically relevant information, we\nperformed a small-scale experiment to evaluate its predic-\ntive power for semantic annotation. We randomly selected\none song from each of 4643 distinct artists. (Artists were\nrestricted to be disjoint from MSS to avoid contamination.)\nEach song was represented by the optimized 222-dimensional\nVQ representation, and as ground truth annotations, we ap-\nplied the corresponding artist‚Äôs terms from the top-300 terms\nprovided with MSD, so that each song xihas a binary anno-\ntation vector yi‚àà{0,1}300. For a baseline comparison, we\nadapt the representation used by Schnitzer, et al. [17], and\nfor each song, we Ô¨Åt a full-covariance Gaussian distribution\nover its ENT features.\nThe set was then randomly split 10 times into 80%-training\nand 20%-test sets. Following the procedure described by\nKim, et al. [12], each test song was annotated by threshold-\ning the average annotation vector of its knearest training\nneighbors as determined by Euclidean distance on VQ repre-\nsentations, and by KL-divergence on Gaussians. Varying the\ndecision threshold yields a trade-off between precision and\nrecall. In our experiments, the threshold was varied between\n0.1 and 0.9.\nFigure 3 displays the precision-recall curves averaged\nacross all 300 terms and training/test splits for several values\nofk. At small values of k, the VQ representation achieves\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly higher performance than the Gaussian represen-\ntation. We note that this evaluation is by no means conclusive,\nand is merely meant to demonstrate that the underlying space\nis musically relevant.\n1http://last.fm\n5812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n0 0.2 0.400.050.10.150.2k=5\nRecallPrecision\n  \n0 0.2 0.400.050.10.150.2k=15\nRecallPrecision\n  \n0 0.2 0.400.050.10.150.2k=30\nRecallPrecision\n  \n0 0.2 0.400.050.10.150.2\nRecallPrecisionk=100\n  \nVQ KLFigure 3 .

Using the optimized VQ repre-\nsentations onX, we constructed trees with each of the four\nsplitting rules (PCA, KD, 2-means, and random projection),\nvarying both the maximum depth Œ¥‚àà{5,6,..., 13}and\nspill threshold œÑ‚àà{0,0.01,0.05,0.10}. AtŒ¥= 13 , this\nresults in leaf sets of size 109 with œÑ= 0, and 1163 for\nœÑ= 0.10. For random projection trees, we sample m= 64\ndimensions at each call to splitRP.\nFor each test song q‚ààX/prime, and treet, we compute the\nretrieval set with Algorithm 3. The recall forqis the frac-\ntion of the true nearest-neighbors kNN(q)contained in the\nretrieval set:\nR(q,t) =|RETRIEVE (q,t)‚à©kNN(q)|/k. (6)\nNote that since true nearest neighbors are always closer than\nany other points, they are always ranked Ô¨Årst, so precision\nand recall are equivalent here.\nTo evaluate the system, k= 100 exact nearest neighbors\nkNN(q)were found fromXfor each query q‚ààX/primeby a full\nlinear search overX.\n4.4 Retrieval results\nFigure 4 lists the nearest-neighbor recall performance for all\ntree conÔ¨Ågurations. As should be expected, for all splitting\nrules and spill thresholds, recall performance degrades as the\nmaximum depth of the tree increases.\nAcross all spill thresholds œÑand tree depths Œ¥, the relative\nordering of performance of the different split rules is essen-\ntially constant: splitPCAperforms slightly better than splitKD,\nand both dramatically outperform splitRPandsplit2M. This\nindicates that for the feature representation under considera-\ntion here (optimized codeword histograms), variance reduc-tion seems to be the most effective strategy for preserving\nnearest neighbors in spatial trees.\nFor small values of œÑ, recall performance is generally\npoor for all split rules. However, as œÑincreases, recall per-\nformance increases across the board. The improvements are\nmost dramatic for splitPCA. WithœÑ= 0, andŒ¥= 7, the\nPCA partition tree has leaf sets of size 6955 (0.8% of X),\nand achieves median recall of 0.24. WithœÑ= 0.10and\nŒ¥= 13 , the PCA spill tree achieves median recall of 0.53\nwith a comparable median retrieval set size of 6819 (0.7%\nofX): in short, recall is nearly doubled with no appreciable\ncomputational overhead. So, by looking at less than 1% of\nthe database, the PCA spill tree is able to recover more than\nhalf of the 100 true nearest neighbors for novel test songs.\nThis contrasts with the Ô¨Ålter-and-reÔ¨Åne approach [17], which\nrequires a full scan of the entire database.\n4.5 Timing results\nFinally, we evaluated the retrieval time necessary to answer\nk-nearest neighbor queries with spill trees. We assume that\nall songs have already been inserted into the tree, since this is\nthe typical case for long-term usage. As a result, the retrieval\nalgorithm can be accelerated by maintaining indices mapping\nsongs to leaf sets (and vice versa).\nWe evaluated the retrieval time for PCA spill trees of\ndepthŒ¥= 13 and threshold œÑ‚àà{0.05,0.10}, since they\nexhibit practically useful retrieval accuracy. We randomly\nselected 1000 test songs and inserted them into the tree prior\nto evaluation. For each test song, we compute the time\nnecessary to retrieve the knearest training neighbors from\nthe spill tree (ignoring test songs), for k‚àà{10,50,100}.\nFinally, for comparison purposes, we measured the time to\ncompute the true knearest neighbors by a linear search over\nthe entire training set.\nOur implementation is written in Python/NumPy,2and\nloads the entire data set into memory. The test machine has\ntwo 1.6GHz Intel Xeon CPUs and 4GB of RAM. Timing\nresults were collected through the cProÔ¨Åle utility.\nFigure 5 lists the average retrieval time for each algorithm.\nThe times are relatively constant with respect to k: a full lin-\near scan typically takes approximately 2.4 seconds, while\ntheœÑ= 0.10spill tree takes less than 0.14 seconds, and\ntheœÑ= 0.05tree takes less than 0.02 seconds. In relative\nterms, setting œÑ= 0.10yields a speedup factor of 17.8, and\nœÑ= 0.05yields a speedup of 119.5 over the full scan. The\ndifference in speedup from œÑ= 0.10toœÑ= 0.05can be ex-\nplained by the fact that smaller overlapping regions result in\nsmaller (and fewer) leaf sets for each query. In practice, this\nspeed-accuracy trade-off can be optimized for the particular\ntask at hand: applications requiring only a few neighbors\nwhich may be consumed rapidly ( e.g., sequential playlist\ngeneration) may beneÔ¨Åt from small values of œÑ, whereas\n2http://numpy.scipy.org\n59Poster Session 1\n0.01% 0.1% 1% 10%00.20.40.60.81\nRetrieval sizeRecallœÑ=0.00\n  \nPCA\nKD\nRandom\n2‚àímeans\n0.01% 0.1% 1% 10%00.20.40.60.81\nRetrieval sizeRecallœÑ=0.01\n  \nPCA\nKD\nRandom\n2‚àímeans\n0.01% 0.1% 1% 10%00.20.40.60.81\nRetrieval sizeRecallœÑ=0.05\n  \nPCA\nKD\nRandom\n2‚àímeans\n0.01% 0.1% 1% 10%00.20.40.60.81\nRetrieval sizeRecallœÑ=0.10\n  \nPCA\nKD\nRandom\n2‚àímeansFigure 4 .

INTRODUCTION\nMusic listeners typically do not listen to a single song in\nisolation. Rather, listening sessions tend to persist over a\nsequence of songs: a playlist . The increasing quantity of\nreadily available, digital music content has motivated the\ndevelopment of algorithms and services to automate search,\nrecommendation, and discovery in large music databases.\nHowever, playlist generation is fundamental to how users\ninteract with music delivery services, and is generally distinct\nfrom related topics, such as similarity and semantic search.\nAlthough many automatic playlist generation algorithms\nhave been proposed over the years, there is currently no\nstandard evaluation procedure. As a result, it is difÔ¨Åcult to\nquantitatively compare different algorithms and objectively\ndetermine if any progress is being made.\nAt present, the predominant approach to playlist algorithm\nevaluation is to conduct human opinion surveys, which can\nbe expensive, time-consuming and difÔ¨Åcult to reproduce.\nAlternatively, current automated evaluation schemes either\nreduce the problem to a (discriminative) information retrieval\nsetting, or rely on simplifying assumptions that may not hold\nin practice.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.In this work, we propose a simple, scalable, and objec-\ntive evaluation procedure for playlist algorithms that avoids\nthe pitfalls of previous approaches. Our approach is guided\nby the observation that playlist generation is not (only) an\ninformation retrieval problem, but a language modeling prob-\nlem. The proposed method can be applied to a large class of\nplaylist algorithms, and we provide several examples with\nexperimental results. Finally, we propose an algorithm to\nlearn an optimal ensemble algorithm from a collection of\nsimple playlist generators.\n2. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLAYLIST EV ALUATION\nAlthough many algorithms for playlist generation have been\nproposed, evaluation procedures have received relatively lit-\ntle speciÔ¨Åc attention. Here, we brieÔ¨Çy summarize previously\nproposed evaluation strategies, which can broadly be grouped\ninto three categories: human evaluation ,semantic cohesion ,\nandsequence prediction . This section is not intended as a\ncomprehensive survey of playlist algorithms , for which we\nrefer the interested reader to [8, chapter 2].\n2.1 Human evaluation\nSince the eventual goal of playlist algorithms is to improve\nuser experience, the ideal method of algorithm evaluation\nis to directly measure human response. Numerous studies\nhave been conducted in which test subjects rate the quality\nof playlists generated by one or more algorithms. Pauws\nand Eggen [18] asked users to provide a query song with a\nparticular context-of-use in mind ( e.g.,lively music ), which\nwas used as a seed to generate a playlist. The user evaluated\nthe resulting playlist on a scale of 1‚Äì10, and how many tracks\nin the playlist Ô¨Åt the user‚Äôs intended use context. From these\nsurvey responses, the authors were able to derive various\nstatistics to demonstrate that their proposed algorithm signif-\nicantly outperforms randomly generated playlists. Similarly,\nBarrington, et al. [1] conducted experiments in which users\nwere presented with two playlists (generated by obscured,\ncompeting systems) and asked to indicate which one was\n(subjectively) better, and why.\nWhile direct human evaluation studies can provide evi-\ndence that one algorithm measurably outperforms another,\nthey also have obvious practical limitations. This can be labo-\nrious, difÔ¨Åcult to reproduce, and may require large numbers\n537Poster Session 4\nof test subjects and example playlists to achieve statistically\nmeaningful results and overcome the effects of subjectivity.\n2.2 Semantic cohesion\nThe general impracticality of large-scale user studies has\nmotivated the development of automated evaluation tech-\nniques. The most common approaches compute some easily\nmeasurable quantity from each song in a generated playlist\n(e.g., artist, album, or genre), which is used to determine\nthecohesion of the playlist. Cohesion may be deÔ¨Åned by\nfrequency counts of meta-data co-occurrence ( e.g., songs\nby the same artist) [13, 14] or entropy of the distribution of\ngenres within the playlist [7, 12]. In this framework, it is\ntypically assumed that each song can be mapped to a unique\nsemantic tag ( e.g.,blues ). This assumption is often unreal-\nistic, as songs generally map to multiple tags. Assigning\neach song to exactly one semantic description may therefore\ndiscard a great deal of information, and obscure the semantic\ncontent of the playlist. A more general form of semantic\nsummarization was developed by Fields, et al. [9], and used\nto derive a distance measure between latent topic models of\nplaylists. However, it is not immediately clear how such a\ndistance metric would facilitate algorithm evaluation.\nIssues of semantic ambiguity aside, a more fundamental\nÔ¨Çaw lies in the assumption that cohesion accurately charac-\nterizes playlist quality. In reality, this assumption is rarely\njustiÔ¨Åed, and evidence suggests that users often prefer highly\ndiverse playlists [20].\n2.3 Sequence prediction\nA more direct approach to automatic evaluation arises from\nformulating playlist generation as a prediction problem: given\nsome contextual query ( e.g., a user‚Äôs preferences, or a partial\nobservation of songs in a playlist), the algorithm must predict\nwhich song to play next. The algorithm is then evaluated on\nthe grounds of its prediction, under some notion of correct-\nness. For example, Platt, et al. [19] observe a subset of songs\nin an existing playlist (the query ), and the algorithm predicts\na ranking of all songs. The quality of the algorithm is then\ndetermined by the position within the predicted ranking of\nthe remaining, unobserved songs from the playlist. Mail-\nlet, et al. [15] similarly predict a ranking over songs from a\ncontextual query ‚Äî in this case, the preceding song or pair\nof songs ‚Äî and evaluate by comparing the ranking to one\nderived from a large collection of existing playlists.\nEssentially, both of the above approaches transform playlist\nevaluation into an information retrieval (IR) problem: songs\nobserved to co-occur with the query are relevant , and all\nother songs as irrelevant . As noted by Platt, et al. [19], this\nnotion of relevance may be exceedingly pessimistic in prac-\ntice due to sparsity of observations. In even moderately large\nmusic databases (say, on the order of thousands of songs), the\nprobability of observing any given pair of songs in a playlistbecomes vanishingly small, and therefore, the overwhelming\nmajority of song predictions are considered incorrect. In\nthis framework, a prediction may disagree with observed\nco-occurrences, but still be equally pleasing to a user of the\nsystem, and therefore be unfairly penalized.\nThe IR approach ‚Äî and more generally, any discrimina-\ntive learning approach ‚Äî is only applicable when one can\nobtain negative examples, i.e.,badplaylists. In reality, nega-\ntive examples are difÔ¨Åcult to deÔ¨Åne, let alone obtain, as users\ntypically only share playlists that they like.1This suggests\nthat discriminative evaluation may not be the most natural Ô¨Åt\nfor playlist generation.\n3. A NATURAL LANGUAGE APPROACH\nIn contrast to discriminative approaches to playlist evalua-\ntion, we advocate the generative perspective when modeling\nplaylist composition. Rather than attempting to objectively\nscore playlists as good orbad, which generally depends on\nuser taste and unobservable contextual factors, we instead\nfocus on modeling the distribution of naturally occurring\nplaylists.\nFormally, letX={x1,x2,...,xn}denote a library of\nsongs. We deÔ¨Åne a playlist as an ordered Ô¨Ånite sequence of\nelements ofX. Any procedure which constructs such ordered\nsequences is a playlist algorithm (orplaylister ). In general,\nwe consider randomized algorithms, which can be used to\ngenerate multiple unique playlists from a single query. Each\nplaylister, be it randomized or deterministic, induces a prob-\nability distribution over song sequences, and may therefore\nbe treated as a probabilistic generative model.\nThis leads to our central question: how should generative\nmodels of song sequences be evaluated? Here, we take in-\nspiration from the literature of statistical natural language\nprocessing [16], in which statistical models are Ô¨Åt to a sample\nof strings in the language ( e.g., grammatically valid sentences\nin English). A language model determines a probability dis-\ntribution Pover strings, which can be evaluated objectively\nby how well Pmatches the true distribution P‚àó. Since P‚àó\nis unknown, this evaluation is approximated by drawing a\nsampleS ‚àºP‚àóof naturally occurring strings, and then\ncomputing the likelihood of the sample under the model P.\nReturning to the context of playlist generation, in place\nof vocabulary words, we have songs; rather than sentences,\nwe have playlists. The universe of human-generated playlists\ntherefore constitutes a natural language , and playlisters are\nmodels of the language of playlists. While this observation\nis not itself novel ‚Äî it appears to be folklore among music\nresearchers ‚Äî its implications for algorithm evaluation have\nnot yet been fully realized. We note that recent work by\nZheleva, et al. [21] evaluated playlisters in terms of perplexity\n1A notable exception is the work of Bosteels, et al. [4], in which explicit\nnegative feedback was inferred from skip behavior of Last.fm users. As\nnoted by the authors, skip behavior can be notoriously difÔ¨Åcult to interpret.\n53812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(exponentiated log-likelihood) of the genre distribution in a\nplaylist, rather than the song selection itself.\n3.1 Evaluation procedure\nTo evaluate a playlister A, we require the following:\n1. a library of nsongsX,\n2. a sample of playlists S‚äÜX‚àó,2and\n3. the likelihood PA[s]of any playlist s‚ààX‚àó.\nWhile the last requirement may seem like a tall order, we\nwill demonstrate that for large classes of playlisters, the\ncomputation can be quite simple.\nA playlisterAcan be evaluated by computing the average\nlog-likelihood of the sample S:\nL(S|A) =1\n|S|/summationdisplay\ns‚ààSlogPA[s]. (1)\nThe average log-likelihood, on an absolute scale, is not\ndirectly interpretable ‚Äî although it approximates the cross-\nentropy between PAand the true, unknown distribution\nP‚àó[16] ‚Äî but it is useful for performing relative compar-\nisons between two playlisters. Given a competing playlister\nA/prime, we can say that Ais a better model of the data than A/primeif\nL(S|A)>L(S|A/prime).\nThere is a subtle, but important distinction between the\nproposed approach and previous approaches to playlist eval-\nuation. Rather than evaluate the perceived quality of a gen-\nerated, synthetic playlist, we instead evaluate the algorithm\nin terms of how likely it is to produce naturally occurring\nplaylists.\n4. PLAYLIST ALGORITHMS\nTo demonstrate the proposed evaluation approach, we will\nderive playlist probabilities for several generic playlisters.\nAlthough the method is fully general, we restrict attention to\nplaylisters which satisfy the Markov property:\nP[(x0,x1,...,xk)] =\nP[X=x0]k/productdisplay\ni=1P[Xt+1=xi|Xt=xi‚àí1].(2)\nWe assume that the Ô¨Årst song is chosen uniformly at ran-\ndom, and therefore contributes a Ô¨Åxed constant log 1/nto the\noverall log-likelihood, which may be safely ignored. The\nlikelihood of an arbitrary playlist under a Markov model\ncan therefore be decomposed into the product of bigram\nlikelihoods, so the log-likelihood is proportional to the sum:\nlogP[(x0,...,xk)]‚àùk/summationdisplay\ni=1logP[Xt+1=xi|Xt=xi‚àí1].\n2X‚àódenotes the Kleene-‚àóoperation, and contains all sequences of any\nlength of elements drawn from X.Note that this reasoning can be extended to higher order\nMarkov models ‚Äî e.g., second order would decompose into\ntrigrams ‚Äî but to ease exposition, we focus on Ô¨Årst-order\nmodels. For the remainder of this article, we will assume\nthatSis a collection of bigrams.\n4.1 Uniform shufÔ¨Çe\nThe simplest playlister selects each song uniformly at ran-\ndom fromX. This can be reÔ¨Åned somewhat by disallowing\nconsecutive repetitions, so that if the current song is xt, then\nxt+1is drawn uniformly at random from X\\{xt}. Since\nxt+1depends only on xt, it satisÔ¨Åes the Markov property,\nand the conditional bigram probability is\nPU[Xt+1=x|Xt=xt] =/braceleftBigg\n1/n‚àí1x/negationslash=xt\n0x=xt.(3)\nThe uniform shufÔ¨Çe playlister provides an obvious baseline,\nand should be included in any comparative evaluation.\n4.2 Weighted shufÔ¨Çe\nA slight variation on the uniform shufÔ¨Çe is to draw the next\nsong not from a uniform distribution, but a weighted dis-\ntribution derived from a score function F(x)>0, which\nmay encode artist popularity, user preference, or any other\nsong-level property. The resulting bigram probability is\nPF[Xt+1=x|Xt=xt] =/braceleftBiggF(x)P\nx/prime/negationslash=xtF(x/prime)x/negationslash=xt\n0 x=xt.\n(4)\nIn general,Fmay be dynamic and can be used to incorporate\nuser feedback, thereby facilitating steerability [15]. Dynamic\nand interactive evaluation is beyond the scope of this article,\nand we focus on static score functions.\n4.3 K-Nearest neighbor and random walks\nAnother simple strategy for playlist generation is to construct\nak-nearest-neighbor ( kNN) graph over the song set by using\nsome previously constructed distance metric ( e.g., acoustic,\nsemantic, or social similarity), and form playlists by a ran-\ndom walk process on the graph. If the next song xt+1is\nchosen uniformly at random from the neighbors Œ∑(xt)of the\ncurrent song xt, then the bigram probability is\nPkNN[Xt+1=x|Xt=xt] =/braceleftBigg\n1/kx‚ààŒ∑(xt)\n0x /‚ààŒ∑(xt).(5)\nOne shortcoming of this approach ‚Äî as well as any deter-\nministic playlister ‚Äî is that it assigns 0 probability to some\ntransitions, in this case, those spanning non-adjacent nodes.\nAny such transition would be inÔ¨Ånitely unlikely under the\nmodel; however, it seems unreasonable to expect that every\nobserved bigram coincides with an edge in the graph (unless\n539Poster Session 4\nthe graph is complete). This can be remedied by smoothing\nwith the uniform distribution (weighted by a constant ¬µ):\n/hatwidePkNN= (1‚àí¬µ)PkNN+¬µPU¬µ‚àà(0,1].(6)\nSince probability distributions are closed under convex com-\nbinations, Eqn. (6) describes a valid distribution. Equiva-\nlently, this models a process which Ô¨Çips a ¬µ-biased coin to\ndecide whether to jump to an adjacent song in the graph, or a\nrandom song in the library (adjacent or not). This modiÔ¨Åca-\ntion to the algorithm increases diversity and Ô¨Çexibility, and\nensures that log-likelihood computations remain Ô¨Ånite.\n4.4 Markov chain mixtures\nAny non-trivial playlister requires some tuning of parameters.\nFor example, to implement kNN, one must select the under-\nlying features and similarity metric, the neighborhood size\nk, and the smoothing parameter ¬µ. This leads to an obvious\nquestion: can these parameters be optimized automatically?\nMore generally, if we start with a collection of playlisters\nAi(say, derived from different features [10, 12], values of\nk,etc.), is it possible to intelligently integrate them to into a\nsingle playlister?\nEqn. (6) exploits the fact that distributions are closed\nunder convex combinations to combine two distributions\n(uniform and kNN) with Ô¨Åxed proportion ¬µ. This can be\ngeneralized to combine mdistributions as follows:\nP¬µ=m/summationdisplay\ni=1¬µiPi‚àÄi:¬µi‚â•0,m/summationdisplay\ni=1¬µi= 1. (7)\nRather than using a Ô¨Åxed weighting ¬µ= (¬µ1,¬µ2,...,¬µm),\nwe can instead optimize ¬µby maximizing the likelihood of\na collection of training examples under the mixture model.\nThis can be accomplished by solving the optimization prob-\nlem listed as Algorithm 1. Because the objective function\n(log-likelihood) is concave in ¬µ, and the constraints are linear,\nthis problem can be solved efÔ¨Åciently [5].\nAfter computing the maximum likelihood estimate ¬µ,\nplaylists can be generated by sampling from the weighted\nensemble distribution P¬µ. The distribution described by\nEqn. (7) characterizes the ensemble playlist algorithm listed\nas Algorithm 2, which, given the current song xt, simply\nselects a playlister Aiat random according to the discrete\ndistribution characterized by ¬µand returns a sample from the\nselected distribution Pi[X|Xt=xt].\n5. EXPERIMENTS\nTo demonstrate the proposed evaluation approach, we im-\nplemented several playlisters on a large song library, us-\ning acoustic-, semantic-, and popularity-based descriptors.\nThe simple playlisters described here are merely intended to\ndemonstrate plausible baselines against which more sophisti-\ncated algorithms may be compared in future work.Algorithm 1 Markov chain mixture optimization\nInput: Training bigrams\nS/prime={(x1,x/prime\n1),..., (x|S/prime|,x/prime\n|S/prime|)}\nMarkov chains P1,P2,...,Pm\nOutput: Combination weights ¬µ1,¬µ2,...,¬µm\nmax\n¬µ1\n|S/prime|/summationdisplay\n(x,x/prime)‚ààS/primelog/parenleftBiggm/summationdisplay\ni=1¬µiPi[Xt+1=x/prime|Xt=x]/parenrightBigg\ns.t.‚àÄi:¬µi‚â•0,m/summationdisplay\ni=1¬µi= 1\nAlgorithm 2 Ensemble playlist generation\nInput: Current song xt, playlisters (Ai,Pi), weights¬µi\nOutput: Next songxt+1\n1:Samplei‚àºDISCRETE (¬µ){ChooseAi}\n2:returnxt+1‚àºPi[Xt+1|Xt=xt]{RunAi(xt)}\n5.1 Song data: Million Song Dataset\nOur song data was taken from the Million Song Dataset\n(MSD) [3], upon which we constructed models based on\nartist terms (tags), familiarity, and audio content.\nTag representations were derived from the vocabulary of\n7643 artist terms provided with MSD. Each song is repre-\nsented as a binary vector indicating whether each term was\napplied to the corresponding artist, and nearest neighbors are\ndetermined by cosine-similarity between tag vectors.\nThe Echo Nest3artist familiarity is used to deÔ¨Åne a static\nscore function Fover songs, which may be interpreted as a\nsurrogate for (average) user preference.\nThe audio content model was developed on the 1% Mil-\nlion Song Subset (MSS), and is similar to the model proposed\nin [17]. From each MSS song, we extracted the time series\nof Echo Nest timbre descriptors (ENTs). This results in a\nsample of approximately 8.5 million 12-dimensional ENTs,\nwhich were normalized by z-scoring according to the esti-\nmated mean and variance of the sample, randomly permuted,\nand then clustered by online k-means to yield 512 acoustic\ncodewords. Each song was summarized by quantizing each\nof its (normalized) ENTs and counting the frequency of each\ncodeword, resulting in a 512-dimensional histogram vector.\nEach codeword histogram was mapped into a probability\nproduct kernel (PPK) space [11] by square-rooting its entries,\nwhich has been demonstrated to be effective on similar audio\nrepresentations [17]. Finally, we appended the song‚Äôs tempo,\nloudness, and key conÔ¨Ådence, resulting in a vector vi‚ààR515\nfor each song xi.\nNext, we trained an optimized similarity metric over audio\ndescriptors. We computed target similarity for each pair of\nMSS artists by the Jaccard index between their user sets in\n3http://developer.echonest.com\n54012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\na sample of Last.fm4collaborative Ô¨Ålter data [6, chapter 3].\nTracks by artists with fewer than 30 listeners were discarded.\nThe remaining artists were partitioned 80/20 into a training\nand a validation set, and for each artist, we computed its\ntop 10 most similar training artists. The distance metric was\nsubsequently optimized by applying the metric learning to\nrank (MLR) algorithm on the training set of 4455 songs,\nand tuning parameters C‚àà{105,106,..., 109}and‚àÜ‚àà\n{AUC, MRR, MAP, Prec@10 }to maximize AUC score on\nthe validation set of 1110 songs. Finally, the resulting metric\nWwas factored by PCA (retaining 95% of spectral mass) to\nyield a linear projection L‚ààR222√ó515which maps each vi\ninto a Euclidean space in which nearest neighbor is optimized\nto retrieve songs by similar artists.\n5.2 Playlists: Art of the Mix\nPlaylist data was taken from the Art of the Mix5(AotM)\ncorpus collected by Berenzweig, et al. [2]. We chose this\ncorpus primarily for two reasons. First, it is the largest pub-\nlicly available set that we know of. Second, each playlist\nwas (ostensibly) generated by a user ‚Äî not a recommenda-\ntion service or commercial radio DJ ‚Äî so the corpus is an\naccurate sample of real playlists that occur in the wild.6\nThe AotM data consists of approximately 29K playlists\nover 218K unique songs by 48K unique artists, which we\ncleaned with a two-step procedure. First, artist names were\nresolved to identiÔ¨Åers by the Echo Nest artist search API.\nSecond, we matched each song‚Äôs artist identiÔ¨Åer to the MSD\nindex, and if the artist was found, we matched the title against\nall MSD song titles by the artist. A match was accepted if\neither title was contained in the other, or the edit distance\nwas less than half the (AotM) title length. This was found\nby informal inspection to yield fewer false matches than a\ndirect ( artist ,title) query to the Echo Nest API.\nHaving resolved songs to MSD identiÔ¨Åers, we then Ô¨Åltered\nthe playlist set down to bigrams in which both consecutive\nsongs were contained in MSD. This results in a collection S\nof 66250 bigrams over a library Xof 26752 unique songs by\n5629 unique artists.7\n5.3 Experimental procedure\nFor each song xi‚ààX, we computed an optimized acoustic\ndescriptorvi‚ààR222, tag vectorwi‚àà{0,1}7643, and artist\nfamiliarity score F(xi)‚àà[0,1]. The familiarity score was\nused to construct a weighted shufÔ¨Çe Markov chain ( Eqn. (4) ).\nThe audio and tag spaces were used to generate kNN Markov\n4http://last.fm\n5http://www.artofthemix.org/\n6One could of course model playlists derived from alternative sources,\nbut be aware that such playlists may have different characteristics than user-\ngenerated playlists: e.g., terrestrial radio playlists may be constrained by\nbroadcast regulations or commercial factors.\n7The bigram data and example playlists for each algorithm\ncan be downloaded from http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/ Àúbmcfee/\nplaylists/ .\nAudio k=16  \n32  \n64  \n128 \n256 \n512 \n1024\n2048\n4096\nTags k=16  \n32  \n64  \n128 \n256 \n512 \n1024\n2048\n4096\nUniform\nFamiliarity\nUnweighted\nOptimized\n‚àí15 ‚àí14 ‚àí13 ‚àí12 ‚àí11 ‚àí10 ‚àí9\nAverage log‚àílikelihood‚àí14.72\n‚àí14.69\n‚àí14.63\n‚àí14.55\n‚àí14.42\n‚àí14.22\n‚àí13.92\n‚àí13.50\n‚àí12.89\n‚àí14.04\n‚àí13.66\n‚àí13.43\n‚àí13.33\n‚àí13.25\n‚àí13.12\n‚àí12.92\n‚àí12.63\n‚àí12.21\n‚àí10.19\n‚àí10.13\n‚àí10.42\n ‚àí9.62Figure 1 .

This results in a\ncollection of 9 audio-based Markov chains, 9 tag-based, and\none familiarity-based. Including the uniform shufÔ¨Çe model,\nwe have a total m= 20 simple playlisters.\nThe playlist setSwas randomly partitioned 10 times\ninto 10%-train, 90%-test sets; each split was performed over\nthe Ô¨Årst element of the bigram so that for each song xi, all\nbigrams (xi,¬∑)belong to either the training or test set. On\naverage, this yields 6670.9 training and 59597.1 test bigrams.\nEach simple playlister was evaluated by computing the\naverage log-likelihood of test bigrams (x,x/prime)(Eqn. (1) ). All\nplaylisters were smoothed by Eqn. (6) with ¬µ= 0.01.\nWe then ran Algorithm 1 on the training set, and evaluated\nthe resulting playlister on the test set. Our implementation\nof Algorithm 1 is written in NumPy,8and on average, con-\nverges to the global optimum in under 20 seconds on standard\nhardware. Since the ensemble includes the uniform model,\nno additional smoothing is necessary. Finally, for comparison\npurposes, we also compared to the unweighted combination\nby Ô¨Åxing each ¬µi=1/m.\n5.4 Results\nFigure 1 lists the average log-likelihood of each model un-\nder comparison. Although the audio- and tag-based models\ntend to generate playlists which are acoustically or seman-\ntically consistent,7they do not accurately model naturally\noccurring playlists. As illustrated in Figure 2 , the majority\nof bigrams disagree with adjacencies in the kNN graphs, so\nkNN methods are outperformed by uniform shufÔ¨Çe. While\nthe features described here do not sufÔ¨Åce to model naturally\noccurring playlists, a richer feature set including lyrical or\nsocial information may signiÔ¨Åcantly improve performance,\nand will be the subject of future research.\nFor small values of k, the tag playlister is forced to select\n8http://numpy.scipy.org\n541Poster Session 4\n0.1% 1% 10%00.10.20.30.4\nk / nBigram %\n  \nAudio k‚àíNN\nTag k‚àíNNFigure 2 .

Tag-based\nplaylisters, therefore, tend to maximize semantic cohesion.\nThe relatively low performance of the tag playlister indicates\nthat semantic cohesion does not adequately describe naturally\noccurring playlists.\nThefamiliarity model performs slightly better than uni-\nform, and signiÔ¨Åcantly better than the audio and tag playlis-\nters. This suggests that popularity and social factors play\nsigniÔ¨Åcant roles in playlist composition; while not surprising,\nthis should be taken into account when designing a playlister.\nThe optimized model produced by Algorithm 2 substan-\ntially outperforms all other models, even when only exposed\nto an extremely small training set (10%). Note that the un-\nweighted combination degrades performance.\nTo help understand contributions of different components\nin the optimized model, we list the average weight assigned\nto each model by Algorithm 1 in Table 1 , grouped by feature\ntype. The content-based models receive a signiÔ¨Åcant amount\nof weight, suggesting that the models contain some amount\nof predictive power. The large weight assigned to the uniform\nmodel may be interpreted as the proportion of information\nnot modeled by content or familiarity, and thus constitutes\na secondary measure of the (lack of) quality of the other\nmodels in the ensemble.\n6. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a simple, automatic evaluation procedure\nfor playlist algorithms. To demonstrate the technique, we\ndeveloped a suite of simple baseline playlisters, and evaluated\ntheir performance on naturally occurring playlists.\n7.

INTRODUCTION \nUsers of modern digital music collections benefit f rom \nmany advantages relative to users of even a decade ago. \nAmongst the greatest of these advantages is cheap a nd con- \nvenient access to diverse and rich on-line sources of musi- \ncal data and metadata. Of particular convenience to  re- \nsearchers and programmers, many on-line sources pro vide \naccess to their data through convenient web service  APIs. \nSuch resources include The Echo Nest, Last.FM, Mu- \nsicBrainz, Amazon, Yahoo! and many others. \nIt is also possible to extract features directly fr om both \naudio and symbolic musical representations. The res ulting \nfeature values can then simply be stored directly a s part of \ndigital music collections. Alternatively, these fea tures can \nbe processed using data mining techniques in order to ar- \nrive at additional metadata, such as class labels o r links to \nother musical entities. \nIt is necessary to overcome certain important chall enges in order to effectively take advantage of the plent iful data \nand metadata that is available, however. One must f ind ef- \nficient and effective ways of automatically accessi ng and \nintegrating information about a given music collect ion from \nthe diverse and often inconsistent on-line resource s; one \nmust ensure that proper identifiers are used to uni quely re- \nfer to the individual entities about which informat ion is ac- \ncessed (e.g. recordings, albums, musicians, etc.), even when \nthe different resources from which data is extracte d may \nidentify entities in entirely different ways; one m ust filter \nout noisy or inaccurate information, which can be a  signifi- \ncant problem when dealing with much of the musical data \nthat is available on-line; one must structure acqui red data so \nthat it can be queried and otherwise accessed in wa ys that \nare consistent and meaningful; and one must make th e data \naccessible to users in ways that are convenient to them in a \nvariety of use cases. \nThis paper presents an upgrade to the well-establis hed \nand open-source Greenstone Digital Library software  [10] \nthat is intended to address these issues. This upgr ade dra- \nmatically expands Greenstone‚Äôs ability to collect m usical \ninformation and make it conveniently available to u sers. \nPart of this upgrade includes the integration of pa rts of the \njMIR [8] music information retrieval software into Green- \nstone, specifically jAudio [7,8], which allows cont ent-based \nfeatures to be extracted from audio recordings.  \nThe second major component of the Greenstone upgrad e \nis the creation and integration of the new jSongMin er soft- \nware, which provides a framework for automatically ac- \nquiring and structuring many types of metadata from  di- \nverse sources of information about music, including  both \non-line resources and metadata embedded in files. T his \nsoftware is highly configurable, in order to meet t he needs \nof a wide variety of different user types. It is al so specifi- \ncally designed to be easily extensible so that diff erent kinds \nof information can be extracted from different data  sources \nas they become available. \nSo, given a set of musical recordings of interest, users \ncan now have Greenstone automatically identify unkn own  \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or  part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee pr ovided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial ad vantage and that cop- \nies bear this notice and the full citation on the f irst page.  \n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n459Poster Session 3\n  \n \nrecordings‚Äîor verify the identity of labelled recor dings‚Äî\nusing audio fingerprinting, extract a wide variety of \nmetadata from different on-line sources related to each re- \ncording, extract content-based features from each r ecording \nand extract any metadata embedded in the tags of ea ch re- \ncording. All of this data is then automatically int egrated, \nstructured and saved. \nUsers may then take advantage of Greenstone‚Äôs estab - \nlished interface to organize, browse or search the newly-\nbuilt music collection. They may also use the Green stone \ninterface to further annotate or edit the collectio n if desired. \nThe musical data can also be published and maintain ed us- \ning Greenstone‚Äôs many existing tools and features. \n2.  RELATED RESEARCH \nThere are a number of software packages for buildin g digi- \ntal libraries that can serve as alternatives to Gre enstone, \nincluding both commercial and open source systems. Ex- \namples of the latter include DAITSS, DSpace, EPrint s, Fe- \ndora and Keystone DLS. Marill and Lucza provide a d is- \ncussion of their comparative merits [6]. Although m any of \nthese are excellent products, Greenstone has the pa rticular \nadvantage of a longstanding association with MIR re search \ndating to the beginnings of the ISMIR conference. \nThere are also a number of audio feature extraction  \npackages available that may be used as alternatives  to jAu- \ndio, including Marsyas [9], MIRtoolbox [5] and Soni c Vis- \nualiser [4]. Although these are all excellent syste ms, jAudio \nhas the special advantage of combining an easily ex tensible \nplug-in architecture for adding new features (as do es Sonic \nVisualiser) with a cross-platform Java implementati on.  \nThere are also a few existing software platforms fo r min- \ning a variety of Internet resources, such as Mozend a [15], \nand related research on integrating metadata is als o being \ndone in the semantic desktop community (e.g. NEPOMU K \n[17]). To the best of the authours‚Äô knowledge, howe ver, \njSongMiner is the only such software focusing speci fically \non music, and has the essential advantages of being  both \nopen source and specifically designed for integrati ng ex- \ntracted data with digital repository software like Green- \nstone. The closest existing software is jMIR‚Äôs jWeb Miner \n[8], which focuses on extracting statistically-deri ved nu- \nmerical features from the Internet, rather than the  raw \nmetadata mined by jSongMiner. \n3.  GREENSTONE \nGreenstone [10] is an open-source and multilingual soft- \nware suite for building and distributing digital li brary col- \nlections. A particular emphasis has been placed on promot- \ning digital libraries in developing countries and i n \nUNESCO‚Äôs partner communities and institutions. Alt-hough Greenstone is intended for library collection s that \ncan consist of a wide and heterogeneous range of ma terials, \nnot just music, it has certainly effectively been a pplied to \nmusical collections in the past (e.g. in [2] and [3 ]).  \nA Greenstone library consists of one or more collec tions. \nThese can each store many different types of docume nts, \nsuch as HTML files, PDFs, images, videos, audio fil es, \nMIDI files, etc. Each such document can be annotate d with \nmetadata tags, which can in turn be used to index, browse, \nsearch or otherwise organize or process a collectio n. \nGiven a set of documents, Greenstone can automatica lly \nbuild and link a collection, a process that can inc lude the \nautomated extraction of metadata as well as the cre ation of \nnew documents. Greenstone comes packaged with a var iety \nof such metadata extractors for different types of docu- \nments, and can be extended with document plugins  for ad- \nditional document types, as has been done here with  jAudio \nand jSongMiner. For example, Greenstone can apply t he \nCANTOR [1] optical music recognition tool to scans of \nscores as they are added to collections in order to  automati- \ncally generate symbolic representations of the musi c. \nUsers can also use Greenstone to manually annotate re- \nsources with metadata using the librarian‚Äôs interface . \nGreenstone collections can also be easily and autom atically \nexpanded by adding new documents to them. \nGreenstone can publish digital libraries either to the In- \nternet or to physical media such as CD-ROMs. The la tter \noption is particularly important when working to ma ke digi- \ntal libraries accessible in locations where network  access is \nlimited or unavailable, such as in developing count ries. The \nparticular metadata fields that are published, as w ell as how \nthey are formatted, are both highly configurable. \nThe Greenstone software and sample collections can be \naccessed at www.greenstone.org. \n4.  JMIR \njMIR [8] is a suite of software tools and other res ources \ndeveloped for use in automatic music classification  re- \nsearch. jMIR includes the following components: \n‚Ä¢ jAudio:  Extracts features from audio files. \n‚Ä¢ jSymbolic:  Extracts features from symbolic music files. \n‚Ä¢ jWebMiner 2.0:  Extracts statistical features from cul- \ntural and listener information available on the Int ernet. \n‚Ä¢ jLyrics:  Extracts features from lyric transcriptions. \n‚Ä¢ ACE 2.0: A metalearning-based automatic classifica- \ntion engine. \n‚Ä¢ jMusicMetaManager: Software for managing and de- \ntecting errors in musical datasets and their metada ta.  \n‚Ä¢ lyricFetcher: Mines lyrics from the Internet.  \n‚Ä¢ jMIRUtilities: Performs infrastructural tasks.  \n‚Ä¢ ACE XML: Standardized MIR file formats.  \n46012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n‚Ä¢ Codaich, Bodhidharma MIDI and SAC/SLAC:  Mu- \nsical research datasets. \nAll of the jMIR components emphasize extensibility,  \nand they may be used both individually and as integ rated \ngroups. All jMIR components are open-source and are  dis- \ntributed free-of-charge at jmir.sourceforge.net. \n5.  EXTRACTING FEATURES FROM AUDIO \nDOCUMENTS IN GREENSTONE \nAs noted above, jAudio [7,8] is a jMIR component th at ex- \ntracts content-based features from audio files. A n ew jAu- \ndio Greenstone plugin has been implemented so that \nGreenstone can now automatically run jAudio to extr act \nand store features from each audio file added to a Green- \nstone collection. jAudio itself has also been updat ed and \nexpanded in order to make it easier to install and use, and \nto expand the range of codecs that it can use. \nOne way to take advantage of the features extracted  by \njAudio is to simply use them as descriptors, just l ike any \nother Greenstone metadata, something that can be pa rticu- \nlarly useful for higher-level features than have an  explicit \nmusical meaning. The extracted features may also be  pro- \ncessed by classification software‚Äîsuch as jMIR ACE \n[8]‚Äîin order to arrive at still further metadata la bels that \ncan themselves be stored, such as content-derived p redic- \ntions of labels like genre, mood, artist, etc. \njAudio can extract features from a variety of audio  file \nformats, including MP3, FLAC, WAV, AIFF and AU. It is \ndistributed with 28 base implemented features, incl uding \nboth low-level features (e.g. spectral flux and spe ctral cen- \ntroid) and higher-level features (e.g. rhythmic fea tures de- \nrived from beat histograms). This number of extract ed fea- \ntures can be dramatically expanded at runtime, as j Audio \nincludes metafeatures  and aggregators  [7,8] that can be \nused to automatically derive further features from base fea- \ntures, such as the standard deviation, rate of chan ge or av- \nerage of a given feature across a set of analysis w indows. \nIn addition, one of the most important advantages o f \njAudio is that it is a relatively simple matter to add newly \ndeveloped features using jAudio‚Äôs plugin interface,  without \nthe need to recompile jAudio (or Greenstone). jAudi o is \nalso highly configurable, so users can decide which  features \nto extract, whether or not to apply pre-processing like nor- \nmalization or downsampling, etc. \nOnce features are extracted, they can simply be sto red \ndirectly in the Greenstone collection metadata. The y can \nalso be exported as ACE XML [8] or Weka ARFF [11] \nfiles for external processing if desired. 6.  USING JSONGMINER TO MINE METADATA  \nAs noted above, jSongMiner is a novel software pack age \nthat provides a framework for extracting metadata a bout \nmusical entities from resources available on the In ternet. \nAlthough it has been designed in the specific conte xt of \nGreenstone, jSongMiner has been implemented such th at it \ncan also be used as a stand-alone application if de sired, or \nused in conjunction with other jMIR components.  \njSongMiner begins by identifying unknown audio file s \nusing audio fingerprinting (The Echonest‚Äôs [14] fin gerprint- \ning services are used by default). jSongMiner can a lso iden- \ntify recordings using metadata that is embedded in audio \nfiles or that is manually specified. \nOnce jSongMiner has identified a recording, it then  ex- \ntracts metadata about it from APIs offered by vario us on-\nline sources, or from metadata embedded in the audi o file. \njSongMiner keeps a record of resource identifiers i n as \nmany namespaces as possible while doing this, thus facili- \ntating the integration of information from differen t sources.  \nIn addition to collecting metadata about songs, jSo ng- \nMiner can also automatically acquire metadata about  artists \nand albums associated with songs. So, if given an u nidenti- \nfied song, jSongMiner will first identify it using audio fin- \ngerprinting, and then extract all available metadat a on this \nsong from all of the on-line resources that it has access to. \nIf this metadata includes artist and/or album ident ifiers, \nthen all available fields will also be extracted fo r this artist \nand/or album as well. In order to avoid redundant q ueries, \njSongMiner can be set to only extract metadata on a lbums \nand artists for which it has not already extracted metadata. \njSongMiner thus allows users to treat songs, artist s and \nalbums as separate resource types, and allows infor mation \nto be extracted and saved independently for each of  them, \nwhilst at the same time maintaining information out lining \nthe connections between resources of the same and d iffer- \nent types. Users also have the option of packaging artist and \nalbum metadata together with song metadata if they prefer. \nOnce metadata has been extracted relating to a song , art- \nist and/or album, this metadata can be saved as an ACE \nXML [8] file or as a return-delimited text file. In  the con- \ntext of Greenstone, the jSongMiner Greenstone plugi n al- \nlows all acquired data and metadata to be automatic ally in- \ncorporated into Greenstone‚Äôs internal data structur es. In any \nof these cases, jSongMiner allows the storage of me tadata \ncontaining diverse character sets. \nEach piece of metadata extracted by jSongMiner in- \ncludes the field label, the metadata value and an i dentifier \nfor the source from which the metadata was collecte d. The \nfield labels are standardized, so that a given type  of infor- \nmation will always be assigned the same field name by \njSongMiner, regardless of where it is acquired from . For \n461Poster Session 3\n  \n \nexample, jSongMiner will place the title of a song in the \n‚ÄúSong Title‚Äù field, regardless of whether one data source \nmight refer to it as ‚ÄúSong Name‚Äù and another as ‚ÄúTi tle‚Äù.  \nThe ability to identify the source of each piece of  \nmetadata is also important, as different sources mi ght sup- \nply different results for a given field. For exampl e, one \nsource might identify the artist associated with a song as \n‚ÄúCharles Mingus‚Äù, and another might specify ‚ÄúCharli e \nMingus‚Äù. For this reason, jSongMiner allows multipl e re- \nsults for the same field to be extracted and stored  in paral- \nlel. If the metadata is cleaned at some later point , the cor- \nrection algorithm (or person) can be defined as a n ew \nsource, and the original uncleaned metadata can be main- \ntained or deleted, as desired. All of this means th at jSong- \nMiner organizes metadata from diverse sources in a struc- \ntured and consistent way, whilst at the same time a llowing \nany idiosyncrasies and subtleties implicit in the o riginal da- \nta sources to be maintained and referenced if desir ed.  \njSongMiner‚Äôs ability to store multiple values for a  given \nmetadata field, from the same or different sources,  also \nhelps to make it possible to move beyond simple fla t data \nstructuring. This is enhanced by jSongMiner‚Äôs (and ACE \nXML‚Äôs) ability to link to external resources (inclu ding RDF \nontologies) via metadata field entries, as well as by the way \nin which jSongMiner treats songs, artists and album s as dis- \ntinct but linked entities. \nUsers can opt to have extracted metadata presented using \nunqualified or qualified Dublin Core [13] tags. In order to \nmake this possible, jSongMiner includes original Du blin \nCore schemas. This use of Dublin Core can be partic ularly \nuseful from a librarian‚Äôs perspective. \nThe primary objective of jSongMiner is to provide a  \ngeneral framework that users can extend to incorpor ate \nwhatever web services and data sources they wish. I t was \nconsciously decided not to design jSongMiner as a f rame- \nwork linked to any specific web services, as APIs c hange, \nweb services go off-line and new ones appear. Furth ermore, \neach on-line resource has its own terms of service potential- \nly limiting which and how much data can be accessed  and \nstored. A strong emphasis was therefore placed on d esign- \ning jSongMiner in a modular way that allows it to b e easily \nextended so that it can be used with arbitrary data  sources, \nrather than biasing its architecture towards the AP Is of any \nparticular data sources. \nSo, one of the primary advantages of jSongMiner is the \nway in which it provides the basic extensible frame work for \nincorporating functionality for accessing particula r web \nservices. Furthermore, it standardizes the ways tha t extract- \ned metadata is labelled, structured and made access ible. \nHaving noted this, the decision was made to impleme nt \nfunctionality for accessing data made available thr ough the \nEcho Nest [14] and Last.FM [12] APIs, two of the ri chest sources of on-line metadata at the time of this wri ting. This \nwas done primarily as a proof of concept and to mak e \njSongMiner immediately useful out of the box. \nUsing the Echo Nest and Last.FM web services, jSong - \nMiner can currently extract over one hundred song, artist \nand album metadata fields. In addition, many of the se fields \ncan have multiple values. For example, there will u sually \nbe multiple artists listed in the ‚ÄúSimilar Artist‚Äù field. \nThe jSongMiner fields range from standard musical \nfields (e.g. ‚ÄúSong Title‚Äù or ‚ÄúGenre‚Äù) to primary ke ys (e.g. \n‚ÄúEcho Nest Song ID‚Äù or ‚ÄúMusic Brainz Artist ID‚Äù) to  con- \ntent-based information (e.g. ‚ÄúDuration (seconds)‚Äù o r ‚ÄúTem- \npo (BPM)‚Äù) to consumption-based data (e.g. ‚ÄúLast.FM  \nTrack Play Count‚Äù or ‚ÄúEcho Nest Artist Hotness (0 t o 1)‚Äù) \nto links to external textual data (e.g. ‚ÄúArtist-Rel ated Blog‚Äù \nor ‚ÄúLast.FM Album Wiki Text‚Äù) to links to multimedi a \n(e.g. ‚ÄúArtist-Related Image‚Äù or ‚ÄúArtist-Related Vid eo‚Äù). \nIn order to make jSongMiner as flexible as possible , the \nsoftware is highly customizable in terms of what ki nds of \ninformation are extracted, where it is extracted fr om and \nhow the data is structured. Such options can be set  through \njSongMiner‚Äôs configuration files and its command li ne.  \nEvery effort has been made to make jSongMiner as ea sy \nto use as possible, with ample documentation in the  manu- \nal, so even users with only moderate computer backg rounds \nshould still have relatively little difficulty usin g the soft- \nware. In addition to including a command line and c onfigu- \nration file-based interface that makes the jSongMin er easy \nto run from other software, jSongMiner also has a w ell-\ndocumented API in order to facilitate the use of jS ong- \nMiner as a library incorporated into other software . \nIf the jSongMiner Greenstone plugin is being used, then \nthe user never needs to interact with jSongMiner di rectly \nwhile using Greenstone. The plugin simply has jSong Miner \nperform tasks in the background, and data it extrac ts is au- \ntomatically structured and linked within the collec tion pro- \nduced by Greenstone. jSongMiner configuration setti ngs \ncan also be specified within the Greenstone interfa ce. \nLike all jMIR components, jSongMiner is cross-\nplatform, open-source and available for free at \njmir.sourceforge.net. \n7.  USE CASES AND CASE STUDIES \nGreenstone is designed to be used for a variety of different \nmusical purposes by a variety of user types. This s ection \nbriefly describes a few of the many possible use ca ses. \nMIR researchers, especially those specializing in m usic \nclassification, are the first user group that will be consid- \nered. Such researchers often have a need for datase ts that \ncan be used to evaluate and compare algorithms. The se da- \ntasets should ideally also be well-annotated with m etadata \n46212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nthat can, among other things, serve as class labels . Green- \nstone could be used by those building MIR research da- \ntasets not only to harvest rich metadata about thei r music \nfiles, but also to export and publish information a bout the \ndataset to the web as linked HTML that other resear chers \ncould search and browse when choosing a dataset to use in \ntheir own research. It should be emphasized that Gr een- \nstone‚Äôs ability to extract content-based features i s especially \nuseful in this context, as this facilitates the pub lication and \ndistribution of a dataset‚Äôs extracted features even  when the \nmusic itself cannot be distributed due to legal lim itations. \nTo serve as an example, a Greenstone collection was  \ngenerated from the audio files of SAC/SLAC, a resea rch \ndataset that has been used in a number of previous studies \n(e.g. [8]). Greenstone automatically extracted cont ent-based \nfeatures and mined metadata from the web, as descri bed \nabove. The result is an automatically annotated Gre enstone \ncollection, whose metadata can be browsed, searched , edit- \ned and published. Figure 1 shows a screen shot of o ne sam- \nple entry. The full published Greenstone collection  is post- \ned at www.nzdl.org/greenstone2-jmir. \n \n \nFigure 1:  A sample entry on Sing, Sing, Sing, by Benny \nGoodman, from the COSI-SLAC Greenstone research col - \nlection. Under the particular display configuration  settings \nthat were chosen for this collection, the main entr y dis- \nplays only basic summary information, and the audio  fea- \ntures and full detailed metadata are left to be dow nloaded \nas ACE XML files for machine processing or viewing.  \nMined images are also displayed, and the audio itse lf is \nstreamed. \nConsidered from a somewhat different perspective, s ome \nof the metadata mined by jSongMiner can also be use d di- \nrectly as features, even though this is not its pri mary pur- pose (e.g. ‚ÄúTempo BPM‚Äù, ‚ÄúKey‚Äù, ‚ÄúTime Signature‚Äù, et c.). \nThis type of usage is facilitated by jSongMiner‚Äôs ( and \nGreenstone‚Äôs) ability to save metadata in ACE XML [ 8], a \nmachine learning-oriented format. \nThe SLAC collection was also used to investigate th is \napplication experimentally. jSongMiner identified e ach of \nthe audio recordings in SLAC using fingerprinting, and was \nthen used in combination with jMIR‚Äôs jWebMiner [8] in \norder to mine a variety of features using the APIs of \nLast.FM and Yahoo. These features were then used to  per- \nform a 10-class 10-fold genre classification experi ment, \nwhere jMIR‚Äôs ACE [8] provided the machine learning func- \ntionality. This resulted in an average 83% classifi cation \nsuccess rate, compared to 68% when only audio conte nt-\nbased features extracted by jAudio were used. For t he sake \nof comparison, 86% was achieved when the same web-\nderived features were used, but model curated ident ifiers \nwere used to extract them rather than identifiers d erived \nfrom jSongMiner‚Äôs fingerprinting results. \nMusic librarians are another important potential us er of \nthe updated Greenstone software. Even those librari es with \nextensive digital collections tend to have relative ly limited \nmetadata available for the bulk of their collection s. The cost \nof manually annotating music is a major stumbling b lock, \nand Greenstone now allows the process to be cheaply  and \neasily automated. Librarians simply need to provide  music \nto Greenstone, which will then automatically annota te it \nwith metadata. Librarians can then validate the ext racted \nmetadata if they wish, a process much cheaper than actually \nentering it. The metadata can then be published to the web \nor CD using Greenstone to provide increased access to li- \nbrary patrons, and the Dublin Core tags generated b y \nGreenstone can be used for internal reference purpo ses. \nThere are also many other potential user types. Pri vate \nmusic collectors might wish to use Greenstone to an notate \ntheir collections, for example, or to detect wrongl y labelled \nrecordings using fingerprinting. To give another ex ample, \nthose in the music industry might use it to enrich their own \ncatalogue or marketing data in a variety of ways. I t is espe- \ncially important to emphasize that jSongMiner is de signed \nto be easily extended to mine data using arbitrary APIs, so \nthere may be many types of data which could potenti ally be \naccessed in the future which have not been envision ed yet. \n8.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH \nThe incorporation of the updated jAudio and the new  \njSongMiner software into Greenstone significantly e x- \npands Greenstone‚Äôs value to those wishing to automa tically \nconstruct, annotate, organize and make accessible l arge \nmusic collections. Greenstone can now identify unkn own \naudio recordings, extract content-based information  from \n463Poster Session 3\n  \n \naudio files and mine Internet resources in order to  automat- \nically build a rich set of metadata about musical e ntities. \nSuch Greenstone collections can consist of many dif ferent \ntypes of documents associated with each musical pie ce, \nartist or album, such as audio files, scores, video s, images \nand PDFs. Users also have the ability to use jSongM iner or \njAudio outside of the Greenstone framework if they wish. \nOne of the main priorities of future research is to  more \nfully incorporate Greenstone and jMIR into the Netw orked \nEnvironment for Music Analysis [16] project. This w ill al- \nlow Greenstone collections to be built and accessed  in a \ndistributed framework that will further increase it s useful- \nness to MIR researchers. \nAnother priority is the design of Greenstone plugin s for \nother jMIR components, so that, for example, featur es may \nalso be automatically extracted from MIDI files add ed to a \nGreenstone collection using jSymbolic, or from lyri cal tran- \nscriptions using jLyrics. \nAn additional priority is the direct incorporation of fur- \nther web services into jSongMiner. Although the mai n val- \nue of jSongMiner is as a framework that facilitates  the in- \ncorporation of arbitrary web services as they becom e avail- \nable, it would still be advantageous for some poten tial users \nto build in immediate support for further currently  existing \non-line resources, such as MusicBrainz, Yahoo! and Ama- \nzon, to name just a few. \nThe fourth priority is the integration of functiona lity for \nautomatically detecting errors in collected metadat a. The \nalready existing functionality in jMIR‚Äôs jMusicMeta - \nManager [8] will be a good starting point. This fun ctionali- \nty will also ideally be expanded to perform auto-co rrection \nthat can automatically update the data sources from  which \nerroneous metadata was mined, if permitted. \n9.

INTRODUCTION\nDetecting the mood evoked by a musical piece is a task which\nis relatively easy for human listeners to perform. The ability\nto automate this process would be of use for music search, re-\ntrieval and recommendation, and for these reasons automatic\ntechniques that recognize emotion in music have been an ac-\ntive topic of research in the past few years (e.g. [5, 8, 10, 17]).\nThe most common method of quantifying a mood state is\nby associating it with a point in a 2-dimensional space with\nvalence (attractiveness/aversiveness) and arousal (energy) as\ndimensions, a concept Ô¨Årst proposed by Russell [14]. High\nvalence values correspond to positive moods such as ‚Äòpleased‚Äô\nor ‚ÄòsatisÔ¨Åed‚Äô, with negative examples being emotions such\nas ‚Äòfrustrated‚Äô or ‚Äòmiserable‚Äô. Arousal can range from neg-\native values (‚Äòsleepy‚Äô) to positive (‚Äòexcited‚Äô). This domain\nis known as the valence-arousal space (see Figure 1). Thus,\nautomatic methods for mood recognition would map a song\nonto a point in this 2-dimensional space. However, also other\nways of quantifying mood have been considered (e.g. [13]).\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for per-\nsonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not\nmade or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies bear\nthis notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2010 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.\nFrustrated\nMiserable\nSleepyExcited Aroused\nTiredDelighted\nAt ease SadAngry\nSatisfiedPleased VALENCEAROUSALFigure 1 . The 2‚àídimensional valence-arousal space, show-\ning a range of emotions on a attractiveness/energy scale.\nA major problem with evaluating (and‚Äîfor machine learn-\ning methods‚Äî training) such algorithms is that high-quality\nground truth mood annotations are hard to come by. Ideally\nthese would be obtained by questioning a range of people on\nwhich emotions (and to which degree) they experience when\nlistening to a range of songs in many styles. Such studies\nare expensive and time-consuming and clearly do not scale\nto the quantity of music required to tackle realistic research\nproblems. A further confounding factor is that the emotion or\nmood associated with a song is a subjective and often personal\nfeature.\n1.1 Contributions\nIn this paper, we conduct a bi-modal analysis of music, simul-\ntaneously studying the audio and the lyrics of songs. Our goal\nis to extract factors that simultaneously underly aspects of the\naudio and the lyrics of popular music, at least statistically. In\nother words, we ask the question: ‚ÄúWhat do the audio and the\nlyrics of songs have in common?‚Äù\nOur hypothesis is that answering this question is likely\nto resolve the problems faced in developing and assessing\nthe quality of mood recognition systems, both those that are\nbased on audio and those based on lyrics (or both). Indeed, we\nassume that the intended mood of a song will inspire the song-\nwriter to use certain timbres, harmony, and rhythmic features,\nin turn affecting the choice of lyrics as well. A further hypoth-\n783Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\nesis is that factors unrelated to mood typically do not simulta-\nneously inÔ¨Çuence the audio and the lyrics. If these hypotheses\nhold, uncovering what lyrics and audio share is equivalent to\nuncovering the mood of a song.\nAs a partial veriÔ¨Åcation our hypotheses, below we Ô¨Årst\ndescribe an exploratory analysis investigating if audio fea-\ntures correlate with valence and arousal, as predicted by a\nnaive mood recognition algorithm based on lyrical informa-\ntion only.\nThe main result in this paper is the application of Canoni-\ncal Correlation Analysis (CCA) [6] between paired represen-\ntations of a song‚Äôs audio and its lyrics. This is an unsupervised\nlearning method that is independent of human experiments,\nable to extract common factors affecting both modes under\nstudy. We illustrate results which intuitively seem to coincide\nremarkably well with a notions of valence, and with another\nnotion that is different but seems related to arousal.\n1.2 Related work\nPrevious work in the area of multi-mode (text and audio) mood\nrecognition has been focused on combining lyrics and audio\ninto combined features for classiÔ¨Åcation [7, 8]. This however\nstill depends on the availability of good quality mood anno-\ntations for a large number of songs. Most strongly related to\nour current work is the investigation of correlations between\nsocial (non-lyrical) tags and audio [16]. Note that it is far less\nobvious that lyrics contain information about mood than in\nsocial tags. However, lyrics are easy to obtain, less subject\nto spamming, and objective. Thus, our work combines the\nbeneÔ¨Åts of the two types of prior work.\nDuring the Ô¨Ånal stages of our study, the MusiXmatch lyrics\ndatabase that is paired with the Million Song dataset was re-\nleased [4]. Our study here is conducted on lyrics gathered by\nourselves, the size of which is smaller but of similar order of\nmagnitude as the MusiXmatch database. The approach pre-\nsented in the current paper can directly be used as a blueprint\nfor future research into the relationship between lyrics and\naudio based on this larger set of data.\n1.3 Outline\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Sec-\ntion 2 we outline our general approach and hypotheses. In\nSection 3 we describe the set of audio and lyric features used\nin this paper. A simple experiment is conducted in Section\n4 exploring correlations between lyrics and audio. Section 5\ncontains our main result on CCA analysis and we conclude\nour Ô¨Åndings in Section 6.\n2. MOOD: THE SYNERGY OF LYRICS & AUDIO?\nSince 2007, the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eX-\nchange (MIREX) has run a task on audio mood classiÔ¨Åcation.\nThe task is to ‚Äòtag‚Äô audio clips with an emotional label. Here,\nthe ground truth is provided by users of the musical radio\nsitewww.last.fm . There are generally three approaches to\ntackling mood classiÔ¨Åcation in these tasks and we summarise\nthem here to highlight the interplay between text and audio.2.1 ClassiÔ¨Åcation based on Audio Features\nThe most common method for classiÔ¨Åcation is based on har-\nmonic and spectral features of the audio [8]. Commonly used\nfeatures include low level indicators such as spectral centroid,\nrolloff, Ô¨Çux, slope, skewness and kurtosis [3], harmonic fea-\ntures such as MFCCs [12] and those based on Short Time\nFourier Transforms [15]. In many cases Support Vector Ma-\nchines are used to discriminate between features and have\nproved to be successful in this setting [9].\n2.2 ClassiÔ¨Åcation based on Lyrical Features\nOther approaches are based on lyrical content only. Bag-Of-\nWords (BOW) representations have recently been successful\nin identifying mood, as well as higher-order statistics such as\ncombinations of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams [5].\n2.3 ClassiÔ¨Åcation using both Audio and Lyrics\nMore complex approaches simultaneously exploit lyrical and\naudio features. Such approaches generally achieve higher\nclassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy than those methods presented in Sub-\nsections 2.1 and 2.2 (see for example [11, 17]).\nA recent analysis by Hu et. al. [8] showed that lyrical fea-\ntures typically outperform audio when used as a classiÔ¨Åer, al-\nthough they note that in their study audio was more useful\nin determining emotions in the 3rdquadrant of the valence-\narousal space in Figure 1 (i.e. ‚Äòsad‚Äô, ‚Äòdepressed‚Äô etc.).\n2.4 Framework\nIn this paper, we will search for correlations between a set of\nfeatures from audio and from the lyrics, under the assumption\nthat the causal factor of any such correlations is the mood, i.e.\nthat emotion is the unique facet that lyrics and audio share. Of\ncourse, such patterns may be subtle and they will be present\nonly ‚Äòon average‚Äô, such that they cannot be reliably detected\non small samples. For this reason, we study such patterns on\na large scale, allowing even subtle correlations to emerge as\nstatistically signiÔ¨Åcant.\nInformally speaking, if xa‚ààRdais ada-dimensional\naudio-based feature vector for a given song, and xl‚ààRdl\nis adl-dimensional lyrical feature vector for the same compo-\nsition, we seek real-valued functions faandflsuch that for\nmany songs and to a good approximation:\nfa(xa)‚âàfl(xl). (1)\nA core assumption is that if such functions faandflcan\nbe found, they must be capturing some notion of mood of an\naudio piece. Due to variability in style, genre, instrumenta-\ntion and potential use of irony (i.e. different mood exhibited\nby the lyrics and the audio), we do not expect to Ô¨Ånd this ap-\nproximate equality to be very strong, or to be valid for many\nsongs, but the size of the data used (see below) should never-\ntheless allow us to Ô¨Ånd statistically signiÔ¨Åcant relation.\nOur strategy differs from previous ones in that it does not\nneed a training set of songs with ground truth mood anno-\ntations. Rather than supervising the learning process using\nground truth labels, we simultaneously train two mood recog-\nnizers, one based on lyrics and one on audio, which supervise\neach other‚Äôs learning.\n78412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3. THE DATA: SONG CORPUS AND FEATURES\nBelow we describe the feature representations of the lyrics\nand audio modes of songs we used in this paper, as well as\nthe corpus of songs used.\n3.1 Lyrics feature representation\nWe used the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency\n(TF-IDF) measure to represent the lyrics in a song. The TF-\nIDF representation of a document is a reweighted version of\na BOW account, accounting for how rare a word is with re-\nspect to a document and the overall collection. Consider the\nithword in thejthlyric. Then the term frequency is the num-\nber of times word iappears in document j, normalised by the\ndocument‚Äôs length:\nTFi,j=|wordiappears in lyric j|\n|lyricj|\nThe inverse document frequency is a measure of the gen-\neral importance of the word in the lyric database:\nIDF i= logtotal number of lyrics\n|lyrics containing word i|\nThe TF-IDF for word iin lyricjis then the product\nTFIDF i,j=TFi,j√óIDF i\n3.2 Audio Feature Extraction\nWe used the Echonest API1to extract features from our au-\ndio and thus obtained 65 spectral, percussive, harmonic and\nstructural features, which are summarised in Table 1.\nField Feature\n1 Tempo\n2 Tempo ConÔ¨Ådence\n3-7 Time Signature\n8 Time Signature ConÔ¨Ådence\n9 Mode\n10 Mode ConÔ¨Ådence\n11 Number of Sections\n12 Energy\n13 Danceability\n14-25 Mean Chroma Pitches\n26-37 Standard Deviation Chroma Pitches\n38-49 Timbre Mean\n50-61 Timbre Standard Deviations\n62 Loudness Start Mean\n63 Loudness Start Standard Deviations\n64 Loudness Max Mean\n65 Loudness Max Standard Deviations\nTable 1 . Audio features extracted from Echonest.\nNote that some of these features (e.g. the Mean Chroma\nPitches) are unlikely to be relevant for mood recognition. Still,\nwe have included them in our experiments to validate our ap-\nproach.\n1http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/\n012345678910012345678910\nValenceArousalFigure 2 . Valence and arousal for the ANEW database.\n3.3 The song corpus\nUsing a simple web-scraper, we obtained lyrics from the pop-\nular lyrical database website www.lyricsmode.com , which\ncontains over 800,000 song entries. We also obtained audio\nfeatures using the Echonest API and found the intersection of\nthese two datasets to be 119,664lyric/audio pairs. We are not\naware of any other lyrical/audio combined studies carried out\non this scale.\n4. EXPLORING MOOD, AUDIO, AND LYRICS\nRELATIONS\nIn a Ô¨Årst exploratory study, we build a simple mood recog-\nnition system based on lyrics, and we verify which (if any)\naudio features are correlated with this mood estimate. This\nis to conÔ¨Årm our basic hypothesis that on average both lyrics\nand audio reÔ¨Çect the mood of a song. To this end we im-\nplemented a simple method for estimating mood from lyrics\nbased on the valence/arousal space described in Sec. 1.\n4.1 Valence/Arousal Estimation\nOne method of analysing emotive content of lyrics is to mea-\nsure the average valence or arousal over a song, picking out\nparticular words from a dictionary where the valence/arousal\nscores are known. We chose the Affective Norms for En-\nglish Words (ANEW) as our dictionary, which contains rat-\nings of 1030 words on pleasure, arousal and dominance col-\nlected by psycholinguistic experiments [2]. The words within\nwere chosen to cover a wide range of the valence-arousal\nspace [10] and we show their means (taken over participants)\nin Fig. 2.\nLetli= (w1,w2...w ni)be theithlyric, comprised of ni\nwords and letL={l1,l2,...l m}be the complete collection\nof lyrics. We then estimate the valence viand arousal aiof\n785Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\nlyricivia\nvi=1\nnini/summationdisplay\nj=1V(wni), ai=1\nnini/summationdisplay\nj=1A(wni), i= 1...m.\nVandAare functions that return the mean valence/arousal if\nwordwniis in the ANEW dictionary and zero otherwise.\nThis is obviously a crude mood recognition system. Note\nhowever that our goal here is to use a simple and transparent\nsystem, only to verify our hypothesis that audio and lyrics\nshare a common cause.\n4.2 Correlations between audio features and mood\nestimates based on lyrics\nGiven our simple mood recognition system based on lyrics,\nwe computed Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between each\nof the audio features and our valence/arousal estimate based\non lyrics. We found many of the correlations to be extremely\nstatistically signiÔ¨Åcant, but below 0.2in absolute value. For\nillustration, in Table 2 we show the audio features that are\ncorrelated with p-value numerically equal to 0, and from those\nonly the 5highest correlations by absolute value.\nAudio Feature Lyrical Feature Correlation\n12 Valence‚àí0.1943\n62 Valence‚àí0.1939\n38 Valence‚àí0.1897\n64 Valence‚àí0.1818\n61 Valence 0.1739\n57 Arousal‚àí0.0591\n59 Arousal‚àí0.0553\n39 Arousal 0.0511\n17 Arousal 0.0462\n24 Arousal 0.0434\nTable 2 . Top correlations with valence and arousal with p-\nvalue numerically 0(audio feature indices refer to Table 1).\nThe strongest relationship is valence against energy, with\na correlation of‚àí0.1943 . This suggests than an increase in\n‚Äòlyrical positiveness‚Äô corresponds to a decrease in energy, and\nis perhaps caused by love ballads, which typically will contain\nmany positive words (‚Äòlove‚Äô,‚Äòheart‚Äô etc.) along with gentle\naudio. Several other audio features strongly correlated with\nvalence are loudness (62,64).\nThe correlations with arousal are more difÔ¨Åcult to inter-\npret. The top three correlations relate to timbre, and seem\nplausible. The features 17and24are mean chroma values\nover the song, and their apparent signiÔ¨Åcance to mood seems\ncounter-intuitive. However, the magnitude of the correlations\nis very small when compared to the valence correlations, and\nwe suspect that these correlations are due to artefacts (e.g.,\nmean chroma values may not be independent of certain loud-\nness features). Unfortunately, this is hard to verify, as the\nexact mechanism of how they are computed is unknown to us\n(they were obtained through the echonest API).\nThe overall conclusion that can be drawn is that a correla-\ntion between valence/arousal is present and signiÔ¨Åcant, which\nconÔ¨Årms our hypothesis that, to some extent, mood is indeedsimultaneously related to both lyrics and audio. However, the\ncorrelations are not very strong. We suggest two possible\nexplanations for this. Firstly, the mood recognition method\nbased on lyrics is simple and imperfect. More crucially, prob-\nably none of the audio features by themselves relate strongly\nto mood‚Äîprobably that a combination of them is more rele-\nvant (in different combinations for valence and arousal) than\neach of the features individually.\nIn the next Section, we will demonstrate a method that is\nimmune to both these problems. We will simultaneously learn\nlinear combinations of the features in the lyrics and audio rep-\nresentations, so as to maximize the correlation between the\nresulting linear combinations. In this way, we avoid our de-\npendency on an initial method for mood recognition based on\nlyrics such as the one introduced in Sec. 4.1. Furthermore, by\nconsidering linear combinations of features, we expect to Ô¨Ånd\nmuch stronger and more meaningful relations.\n5. CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS\nWe will Ô¨Årst discuss the theory of CCA before presenting our\nÔ¨Åndings (see e.g. [1] for a more in depth treatment).\n5.1 Background\nCCA is a technique that can be used to Ô¨Ånd information that\nis consistent in two datasets by revealing linear correlations\nbetween them, and is particularly useful in high-dimensional\ndatasets such as ours.\nGiven two datasets X‚ààRn√ódxandY‚ààRn√ódy, the ob-\njective of CCA is to Ô¨Ånd weightings wx‚ààRdxandwy‚ààRdy\nthat maximise the correlation between the projections of X\nandY,XwxandXwy. Thinking of these projections as di-\nrections through the data spaces, CCA looks for a projection\nwhich will minimise the angle ‚à†betweenXwxandXwy.\nMathematically, this optimization problem is written:\n{w‚àó\nx,w‚àó\ny}= argmin\nwx,wy‚à†(Xwx,Yw y),\n= argmax\nwx,wycos(‚à†(Xwx,Yw y)),\n= argmax\nwx,wy(Xwx)/prime(Ywy)/radicalbig\n(Xwx)/prime(Xwx)/radicalbig\n(Ywy)/prime(Ywy),\n= argmax\nwx,wyw/prime\nxX/primeYwy/radicalbig\nw/primexX/primeXwx/radicalbigw/primeyY/primeYwy.\nIt is known that this optimization problem can be solved\nby solving the following generalized eigenvalue problem (see\ne.g. [1] for a derivation):\n/parenleftbigg0X/primeY\nY/primeX 0/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggwx\nwy/parenrightbigg\n=Œª/parenleftbiggX/primeX 0\n0Y/primeY/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggwx\nwy/parenrightbigg\n.(2)\nThe eigenvalue Œªin Eq. (2) is equal to the achieved corre-\nlation between the projections of XandYon their respective\nweight vectors wxandwy. Thus, the eigenvector correspond-\ning to the largest eigenvalue is of greatest interest, with suc-\ncessive ones of decreasing importance. An additional prop-\nerty of CCA is that projections on successive components are\nindependent, such that each of the eigenvectors capture un-\ncorrelated information.\n78612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n5.2 Experiments\nIn our setting, the data XandYrefer to audio and lyrical\nfeatures. For lyrical features independent of mood, we used\nthe TF-IDF measure described in Subsection 3.1.\nTo prevent overÔ¨Åtting of the method we performed 100-\nfold cross validation. I.e., we split the set of 119,664songs\ninto100disjoint subsets and apply CCA on the union of 99\nof them, after which we compute the correlation between the\nprojections of the remaining subset on the obtained weight\nvectors as a validation. This is repeated 100times, leaving\nout each of the 100subsets in turn. The mean training and\ntesting correlations over the folds are shown in Figure 3.\n5 10 1500.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45\nCCA ComponantTraining/Test Correlations\nFigure 3 . Training/Testing (upper/lower bars) correlations of\nthe CCA components, with Error bars of 1 standard deviation.\nIt can be seen that training and test correlations are quite\nclose, especially in the Ô¨Årst two components (suggesting the\ndata is not signiÔ¨Åcantly overÔ¨Åtted). Correlations on the train-\ning set are likely to always be higher than on the test set, but\nit appears not signiÔ¨Åcantly so, as the error bars on the test set\noverlap those for the training data in these cases.\nConÔ¨Ådent that the CCA algorithm was not overÔ¨Åtting the\ntraining data, we proceeded to train the weights on all of the\ntraining data, and tested on the complete set. The Ô¨Årst com-\nponent is shown in detail in Table 3.\nInspecting Table 3, the Ô¨Årst component seems to closely\ncorrespond to valence‚Äîeven though this was not imposed by\nthe algorithm. Low weights are associated with strongly neg-\native emotions/words, which would lie in the 4thquadrant of\nthe valence-arousal space (see Fig. 1). In contrast, the words\nwith high weights appear to correspond to positive moods ( 1st\nquadrant), although there are some outliers in the 3rdand4th\ncolumns. In the audio domain the features most negatively\nweighted in the CCA components were all related to Timbre,\nthe most positive to Loudness.\nTo verify that the Ô¨Årst component relates to valence, weLowest Highest\nWord Lyrical Weight Word Lyrical Weight\nDeath -0.075996 Love 0.1248\nDead -0.064387 Baby 0.049397\nHate -0.054789 Heart 0.047417\nPain -0.047474 Hay 0.029812\nEvil -0.04673 Home 0.028472\nLife -0.042257 Lonely 0.027777\nStench -0.040415 Good 0.027413\nHell -0.038346 Blue 0.026954\nWar -0.037502 Sin 0.026194\nDestroy -0.036671 Loved 0.026123\nFeature Audio Weight Feature Audio Weight\n38 -0.61774 64 0.3919\n50 -0.22214 62 0.28949\n42 -0.15033 65 0.19222\nTable 3 .

We should point out\nthat further components (not shown here due to space con-\nstraints) are harder to interpret in terms of aspects of mood we\nare aware of. However, given the encouraging results for the\ndominant components we believe they are likely to be helpful\nin a multi-dimensional characterization of mood in audio and\nin lyrics. As such they may be helpful in applications such as\nmusic classiÔ¨Åcation and recommendation in particular.\nInterestingly, our approach also opens up possibilities of\ndetecting more high-level properties in music, such as irony\nand sarcasm. The ability to recognize strongly correlated as-\npects of mood from both audio and lyrics also allows us to\nidentify songs where there is a discrepancy or tension between\nthe mood in the audio and the mood in the lyrics, violating the\nglobal pattern of correlation.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we investigated the correlation between audio\nand lyrics, demonstrating that there exist weak but highly sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant correlations between lyrical and audio features. Fol-\nlowing this, we used Canonical Component Analysis to un-\ncover strong correlations between linear combinations of lyri-\ncal and audio features which, at least in part, appear to corre-\nspond to known aspects of mood and valence and arousal.\nIn further work we intend to rerun our experiments includ-\ning also the MusiXmatch dataset [4]. Furthermore, we intend\nto use more features such as images, video, social tags and\nn‚àígram features in the lyrical domain.\n7. REFERENCES\n[1] T. De Bie, N. Cristianini, and R. Rosipal.

INTRODUCTION\nChords are musical features which compactly describe the\nharmonic content of Western music. They have been used to\nsuccessfully identify keys [17], cover songs [2] and genres\n[1], conÔ¨Årming their use in understanding and analysing mu-\nsical harmony, underscoring the importance of systems able\nto recognize chords from music audio. An important as-\npect of the chord recognition problem is the limited amount\nof high-quality audio annotations on which to train machine\nlearning systems, currently limited to 218 songs by The Bea-\ntles, Queen and Zweieck.1The result is that the perfor-\nmance of machine learning systems for chord recognition\n1available at http://isophonics.net/\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.are starting to stagnate at around 80% in the MIREX evalu-\nation metric for an alphabet of major and minor chords only.\nIn this paper, we propose a system that complements the\nvaluable available data with annotations found in large on-\nline chord databases. In particular, here we make use of the\nchord database e-chords.com2, a guitarist website contain-\ning approximately 140,000 partially labelled chord annota-\ntions. Exploiting this data is non-trivial though: it does not\ncontain timing information, and the quality of the annota-\ntions is highly variable.\nThe proof-of-concept that such information can be ex-\nploited in a semi-supervised learning setting has already been\nprovided in a very small-scale study [15]. Unfortunately, it\nturns out that after scaling this up to more data this approach\nby itself is insufÔ¨Åciently robust to overcome the quality is-\nsues with the online annotations. In the current paper, we\ntherefore adopt a curriculum learning approach, which at-\ntempts to add ‚Äòeasy‚Äô data points Ô¨Årst and ‚Äòhard‚Äô ones only\nlater (if at all). To quantify ‚Äòeasiness‚Äô, we also introduce a\nnew metric to evaluate chord recognition performance when\nno ground truth annotation is available, but an online anno-\ntation is. This new metric by itself is a valuable contribu-\ntion, as it allows one to evaluate chord recognition systems\non artists other than The Beatles, Queen and Zweieck.\n2. PRELIMINARIES\nIn this section we describe our overall approach to chord\nrecognition, the audio features we make use of, as well as\nthe data we were able to extract from e-chords.\n2.1 Model Architecture\nAs a baseline system, we make use of a Hidden Markov\nModel (HMM), which has been used extensively and suc-\ncessfully for chord recognition [7, 17]. Here, the hidden\nchain represents the sequence of chords in a sequence of\ntime frames the song is segmented in. Assuming that chords\nrarely change between beats, we chose our frames to be\n2www.e-chords.com\n639Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nCCCFFFFAmAmAm\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nA\nB\n1 4 8\nTime Progression (frames)Pitch ClassFigure 1 . The HMM topology of our model, showing the\nhidden nodes of the HMM (chords) emitting 12-dimensional\nfeature vectors (chromagrams).\nthe time periods between consecutive beats as estimated us-\ning BeatRoot [6]. The observed chain corresponds to 12-\ndimensional chromagram feature vectors [6, 12] in the cor-\nresponding frames. The chromagram represents the distri-\nbution of energy across pitch classes of the harmonic content\nof the audio. The model is depicted in Fig. 2.1.\n2.2 Feature Extraction: the Loudness-Based\nChromagram\nThere is no single method to compute a chromagram feature\nvector, but the most popular ones are based on the Fourier\nand constant-Q transforms [4, 9, 11]. In this paper we will\nemploy a newly proposed variant, called the loudness-based\nchromagram [16]. The salient feature of this chromagram\nis that it is closer to how humans perceive the strength of\npitches. Similar to existing variants, the loudness chroma\nextraction process outputs a matrix C‚ààR12√óTfrom a monau-\nral signal x, whereTis the length of the feature in number\nof frames.\n2.3 Ground Truth Extraction\nFor each song for which a ground truth is available, we con-\nstructed the chromagram C‚ààR12√óTfeature vector, where\nTis the number of (estimated) beats. This is complemented\nwith a corresponding chord annotation A‚ààATextracted\nfrom the ground truth annotations, where Ais a chord alpha-\nbet set. The fully annotated songs from The Beatles, Queen\nand Zweieck thus make for three sets of training data, de-\nnoted as{CB,GT B},{CQ,GT Q}and{CZ,GT Z}.\nYou know I love you\nAnd I‚Äôll prove my love is true\nWant to show how I feel\nHoping that you love me\n‚ÄòCosit‚Äôs plain to see\nThat our love is realC F\nC G7\nDm9 G11Figure 2 . Example Untimed Chord Sequence (UCS) for\n‚ÄòOur love is real‚Äô (Matt McVicar), showing chord labels\nabove lyrics.\n2.4 E-chords extraction\nAs in [15], we extracted Untimed Chord Sequences (UCSs)\nfrom the chord database e-chords.com. These UCS are re-\nferred to as ‚Äòuntimed‚Äô as they only contain (noisy) infor-\nmation about the ordering of the chords, with no additional\ninformation on exact timing. From the e-chords website we\nwere able to scrape over 140,000 such UCSs, but we could\nonly use those for which we had access to the audio as well.\nWe combined our personal music collections and found the\noverlap with the UCS database to be 2008 tracks. Note that\nalthough it is unfortunate that we were only able to extract\na small proportion of UCSs from the database ( 2008 ), this\nnumber is signiÔ¨Åcantly larger than the number of currently\navailable training examples ( 218).\nWe calculated a loudness-based chromagram for each of\nthese 2008 songs in the echords dataset and refer to the e-\nchords chromagram/UCS set as {CEC,UCS}.\n3. EXPLOITING UCS‚ÄôS AS PARTIAL\nSUPERVISION DURING TRAINING\nThe UCSs clearly provide information about the true chords\nin an audio Ô¨Åle, albeit only partial information. They convey\ninformation on the chords of many songs, but unfortunately\nthe explicit timings of the sequences are not known. Making\nuse of unlabelled (or partially labelled) data together with la-\nbelled data for training is known as Semi-Supervised Learn-\ning(SSL) [5].\n3.1 The semi-supervised learning approach\nThe general approach of exploiting UCSs during training\nwas introduced in [15], and we brieÔ¨Çy summarize it here.\nThe approach works by initially training the chord recogni-\ntion system (the HMM) based on the fully labelled training\ndata, here called the Core Training Set (CTS).\nSubsequently, it attempts to reconstruct the timings of the\nUCSs by aligning them to the chromagram feature vectors\n64012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nextracted from the corresponding audio. An example UCS\nis shown in Figure 2. The Ô¨Årst six chords are to be repeated,\nalthough it is hard to infer this automatically without prior\nknowledge of the song. Unfortunately, this source of ‚Äôstruc-\ntural noise‚Äô is hard to capture using automatic methods to\nscrape UCSs from websites, so we would miss this informa-\ntion.\nTo overcome this, the Jump Alignment (JA) algorithm\n(see [15]) can be used. The JA algorithm is able to align\nUCSs to audio, while allowing for jumps to the start of other\nlines (e.g. to allow a section to be repeated). The probabil-\nities of jumping forward or back in an annotation, as well\nas the key transposition and version are all chosen by maxi-\nmum likelihood. A different approach to dealing with struc-\ntural noise in online annotations has recently been proposed\nby the authors of [13], which could be combined with our\nalignment method to yield further improvements.\nAfter aligning our UCSs to their audio, they are in the\nform of fully labeled training data and can be added to the\nCTS. We refer to the resulting set of annotated data as the\nExpanded Training Set (ETS). Finally, the chord recogni-\ntion system can be retrained based on the ETS. The hope is\nthat this approach will allow one to train a chord recognition\nsystem to be able to recognize chords in genres that are dif-\nferent from those for which fully annotated chord sequences\nare available.\n3.2 Evaluation setup in this paper\nThis approach was introduced and tested on a small scale\nin [15], involving only songs for which a ground truth anno-\ntation is available. In this paper we test this approach on a\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly larger scale. In particular, as CTS, we use the\nQueen and Zweieck songs:\nCTS ={/uniondisplay\n{CQ,CZ},/uniondisplay\n{GT Q,GT Z}}\nThe ETS is the union of the CTS and the set of 2008 songs\nfor which we have the audio and a UCS from e-chords:\nETS ={/uniondisplay\n(CQ,CZ,CEC),/uniondisplay\n(GT Q,GT Z,AUCS )}\nThe test set consists of all The Beatles songs and their ground\ntruth annotations.\nThe Ô¨Çow-chart of this set-up is shown in Fig. 3, which\nalso shows the parameters that are inferred at various stages\n(the HMM initial and transition probability matrices Iand\nT, as well as the mean and covariance matrices for the Gaus-\nsian output probability densities, ¬µandŒ£). After retraining\nbased on the ETS, they are referred to as I/prime,T/prime,¬µ/primeandŒ£/prime.\nAs the results in Sec. 5 show, unfortunately in this setting\nthis basic approach deteriorates performance, rather than\nimproving it. To resolve this issue, here we propose to addi-\ntionally adopt a curriculum learning approach.\nEstimate \nParameters\nJump Alignment\nAligned UCSs\nUpdate \nParametersBeatles \nFeatures\nViterbi \nDecoder\nBeatles \nPredictionBeatles GTs\nPerformanceQueen Features\nQueen GTs\nŒ∏= {T, I, Œº, Œ£}\nŒ∏'= {T', I', Œº', Œ£'}Zweiek Features\nZweiek GTs\nUCS Features\nUCSsFigure 3 .

CURRICULUM LEARNING\nIn this section, we describe an addition to the scheme in\nFigure 3 which makes the most of the available data using\ncurriculum learning. We also outline our new evaluation\nmethod. We begin with some background information on\nthe subject.\n4.1 Background\nIt has been shown that humans and animals learn more ef-\nÔ¨Åciently when training examples are presented in a mean-\ningful way, rather than in a homogeneous manner [8, 10].\nExploiting this feature of learners is referred to as Shaping\nin the animal training community and Curriculum Learning\nin the machine learning discipline [3].\nThe concept of the curriculum paradigm is that starting\nwith easy examples and slowly generalising leads to more\nefÔ¨Åcient learning, which can be realised in a machine learn-\n641Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\ning setting by carefully selecting training data from a large\nset of examples. It was recently hypothesised that curricu-\nlum learning offers faster training (in both optimization and\nstatistical terms) in online training settings, owing to the\nway the learner wastes less time with noisy or harder to pre-\ndict examples, and that additionally guiding the training into\na desirable parameter space will lead to greater generaliza-\ntion [3].\nWe introduce an additional step into Figure 3 to deal with\ncurriculum learning in a novel way. Note that up to now we\nhave not deÔ¨Åned what we understand by easy examples, or\nequivalently, how to sort the available examples into a series\nof increasing difÔ¨Åculty samples. Therefore, after the UCSs\nhave been aligned to the features, we will attempt to sort the\nexpansion set by appropriateness for learning. We propose\na new measure for evaluating how accurate the set AUCS\ncompared to its (unknown) ground truth annotations.\nThus we have the two following assumptions:\n1. Introducing ‚Äòeasy‚Äô examples into the training set leads\nto faster learning.\n2. It is possible to estimate which training examples from\na varied set are ‚Äòeasiest‚Äô.\nWe will address these assumptions in the following sub-\nsection.\n4.2 Alignment Quality Proxy\nWhen we created the ETS , we were unable to evaluate how\nwell the UCSs aligned to the loudness-based chromagrams,\nsince the ground truths are not available for these songs.\nHowever, we were able to estimate the accuracy of the align-\nment in a different way.\nTo begin with, we noticed that many alignments con-\ntained only a few chords and were therefore extremely un-\nlikely to be accurate chord alignments. We therefore re-\nmoved all alignments which contained fewer than 5unique\nchords.\nAfter this pruning, we looked into a quantitative estimate\nfor the alignment quality. An output of the JA algorithm is\nthe log-likelihood of UCS correctly aligning to the loudness\nchroma. For each UCS ‚ààAUCS we used the log-likelihood\nof the alignment normalised by the length of the alignment\nas a proxy for the performance, and stored these in the align-\nment quality proxy vector Paqp:\nPi\naqp=log-likelihood of AUCS i\n|AUCS i|,i= 1...|AUCS|\nThe results of the Alignment Quality Proxy performances\non our songs are displayed as a histogram in Figure 4. There\nis a range from‚àí1.79(very poor alignment) to 7.03(excel-\nlent alignment), and we notice a skew towards good quality\nalignments.\n‚àí2‚àí1012345678020406080100120Frequency\nAlignment Quality Proxy PaqpFigure 4 . Histogram of our proposed alignment quality\nmeasure.\nWe then sorted the ETS with respect to Paqpand seg-\nmented the set into bands according to alignment perfor-\nmance. In order to investigate the quality of the proposed\nalignment performance we ran JA on 173 Beatles songs for\nwhich we had UCSs, with the alignment parameters from\nQueen and Zweieck, yielding PB\naqp. We also used these pa-\nrameters to make an HMM prediction for each of the 173\nsongs and measured the performance PBof these predic-\ntions against the Beatles ground truth sequences.\nFinally, we measured the correlation between the PB\naqp\nandPBusing Pearson‚Äôs linear correlation coefÔ¨Åcient, which\ngave a correlation of 0.73with ap-value of 0.4√ó10‚àí30,\nindicating a highly signiÔ¨Åcant result at the 5%level (p <\n0.05). This result indicates that Paqpis an excellent proxy\nfor alignment accuracy, i.e. we have answered assumption 2\nin Subsection 4.1 in the afÔ¨Årmative.\nSatisÔ¨Åed that Paqpoffers an approximation of how well\nJA aligns UCSs, we decreased the size of the ETS by placing\na threshold on the alignment quality. Mathematically, we al-\nlowed theithchromagram and aligned UCS pair {Ci,AUCSi}\ninto the training set if\nPi\naqp‚â•Œ≥\nforŒ≥‚ààR. The value Œ≥=‚àí‚àû corresponds to being care-\nfree with our data - all training examples are included. If\n64212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwe wish to be stringent with our data, selecting a large Œ≥\nwill only allow high-quality alignments into the training set,\nalthough we may suffer from lack of examples in this sce-\nnario.\n5. EXPERIMENTS\n5.1 Simple Chord Prediction\nIn our Ô¨Årst experiment we set the alphabet Ato consist of\nmajor and minor chords, along with a ‚ÄòNo Chord‚Äô symbol.\nWe refer to this alphabet as minmaj . All chords in the Core\nTraining Set CTS and Expanded Training Set ETS were\nmapped to minor chords if they contained a minor third, oth-\nerwise they were mapped to the corresponding major chord.\n‚ÄòNo Chord‚Äô symbols were added to the beginning and end\nof each of the Untimed Chord Sequences in UCS to account\nfor the silences at the beginning and end of the pieces.\nTo re-iterate, we trained an HMM on the ETS and tested\non all 180 Beatles songs. Performance was measured by\nnumber of correctly identiÔ¨Åed frames divided by the number\nof frames (√ó100% ), averaged over the 180 songs, and are\nshown in Table 1.\nThe results seen in Table 1 seem initially discouraging.\nThe peak performance of 77.87% obtained using the 1021\nbest UCSs (in terms of alignment performance) only achieved\nan increase of 0.84%. However, upon performing a one-\nsided t-test of the performance of the system against the\nbaseline performances (no expansion set), we obtained a p-\nvalue of 0.0435 , indicating signiÔ¨Åcance at the 5%level.\nUsing additional data in a system which is already per-\nforming well is unlikely to offer a large performance in-\ncrease, since there is not much to be gained. On the con-\ntrary, when the difÔ¨Åculty of the task increases it is possible\nthat extra data becomes beneÔ¨Åcial. To investigate whether\nthis is the case, we will increase the complexity of the model\nby using a larger library of chords.\n5.2 Complex Chord Prediction\nThe results of subsection 5.1 showed that there is not much\nto be gained by using additional data sources on a simple\nchord model. To counteract this, we conducted the same\nexperiments using an unrestricted chord alphabet A=full.\nThis meant that each unique chord in the Core and Expanded\ntraining sets were considered a unique state of our model,\nas well as the transpositions of each of these chords into\neach root pitch. This left us with 253 states, one order of\nmagnitude larger than the major/minor chord alphabet.\nAs before we then retrained on the Expanded Set and\ntested on The Beatles. The results were measured as in Sub-\nsection 5.1. Figure 5 shows the results as well as the number\nof songs in the expansion set for each cut-off.\nFigure 5 . Performance of our model on The Beatles dataset\nwith increasing alignment quality threshold quality Œ≥. The\nbaseline performance ( Œ≥=‚àû) is shown as a dashed line.\nValues ofŒ≥for which the performance approaches or ex-\nceeds the baseline is shown in higher resolution steps of 0.2\nincrements. Randomizations of the same expansion set size\nare shown in the dot-and-dashed line.\nImmediately from Figure 5 we see that blindly adding all\nof the available does not improve recognition. This is due\nto the large variety in style and genre seen in the database,\nalong with the potentially poor alignments which we in-\ncluded in the expansion set when Œ≥is small. Upon increas-\ningŒ≥we allowed heuristically better quality alignments into\nthe training set, and saw a rapid increase in recognition ac-\ncuracy, which peaks at 58.52%,3.54% above the baseline\nof54.98%. Although this increase may seem incremental,\nwe performed a one-sided t-test of the performance of the\nsystem against the baseline at the optimal Œ≥of5and found\nthep-value to be 1.28√ó10‚àí7, indicating a signiÔ¨Åcant im-\nprovement at 5%conÔ¨Ådence level. This corresponded to an\nimprovement of 114 of the 180 songs.\nTo see if curriculum learning genuinely offered improve-\nments over homogeneous learning, we also included aligned\nUCSs into the training set in random batches of the same\nsize as the previous experiment, and repeated 100 times to\naccount for random variations. The mean and standard devi-\nations over the 100 repeats are shown as the dot-and-dashed\nline and bars in Figure 5. We can see that the speciÔ¨Åc order-\ning of the expansion set in section 4.2 offers substantial im-\nprovement over randomly selecting the expansion set. This\nis good evidence that curriculum learning is the method of\nchoice for navigating a large set of training examples, and\nalso demonstrates that assumption 1 in Subsection 4.1 holds.\n643Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nAlignment Quality threshold Œ≥ -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5‚àû\nNumber of Expansion songs |AUCS| 1027 1027 1021 993 899 705 390 67 0\nPerformance (%) 77.83 77.83 77.87 77.81 77.77 77.53 76.94 76.79 76.79\np-value of paired t-test 0.0516 0.0516 0.0435 0.0555 0.0561 0.1137 0.4779 0.6906 -\nTable 1 .

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have made three breakthroughs. First of\nall, we demonstrated that chord databases can be used to\ncreate new sequences for training chord recognition algo-\nrithms. These sequences were shown to signiÔ¨Åcantly im-\nprove recognition accuracy on an unseen test set.\nAlso, we demonstrated a new technique for estimating\nthe quality of aligned chord sequences, which can be used to\nselect training examples from a large, noisy training data set.\nThis estimate allowed us to perform curriculum learning,\nwhich achieved faster learning and improved results.\nFinally, we also showed that with more data we are able\nto make a more complex chord model, which led to a more\nsigniÔ¨Åcant improvement in recognition accuracy. In order\nto gain the most from these data we plan to further increase\nthe complexity of the decoding model, by including distinct\nfeatures for the bass and treble frequency range [14], includ-\ning a hidden ‚Äòkey chain‚Äô to model modulations [18] or using\nmore complex emission probability models.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nThe common practice in productions of studio recordings\nconsists of several phases. At Ô¨Årst the raw audio material\nis captured and stored on a support. This material is sub-\nsequently combined and edited in order to produce a mix,\nwhich is Ô¨Ånalized in the mastering phase for commercial\nrelease. Nowadays, the whole process revolves around a\ncomputer Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).\nIn the case of instrumental recording, the initial task in-\nvolves capturing a complete reference run-through of the en-\ntire piece, after which additional takes of speciÔ¨Åc sections\nare recorded to allow the mixing engineer to mask perfor-\nmance mistakes or reduce eventual environmental noises.\nThe role of a mixing engineer is to integrate these takes\nwithin the global reference in order to achieve a seamless\nÔ¨Ånal mix [2]. The Ô¨Årst step in preparing a mix session con-\nsists in arranging the takes with regards to the global ref-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.erence. Figure 1 shows a typical DAW session prepared\nout of a reference run-through (the top track) and additional\ntakes aligned appropriately. Those takes usually require fur-\nther cleanup as they commonly include noise or conversa-\ntion that are not useful for the Ô¨Ånal mix. This means that,\nin addition to alignment, the mixing engineer identiÔ¨Åes cut-\npoints for each take that correspond to relevant regions in\nthe reference. The additional takes are Ô¨Ånally blended with\nthe reference by crossfading short overlapping audio regions\nto avoid perceptual discontinuities.\nFigure 1 . A typical DAW mixing session.\nThe purpose of this work is to facilitate the process of\nmixing by integrating automatic (audio to audio) alignment\ntechniques into the production chain. Special care is taken to\nconsider existing practices within the workÔ¨Çow, such as au-\ntomatic identiÔ¨Åcation of interest points. In contrast to most\nliterature on audio alignment, we are concerned with two\nessential aspects: the ability to identify a partial alignment\nwith an unknown starting position and the detection of re-\ngions of interest inside the alignment. Moreover our ap-\nproach permits to achieve different degrees of accuracy de-\npending on efÔ¨Åciency requirements.\nUsing audio material collected from two real-life record-\ning sessions, we show that it is possible to optimize the op-\nerations of sound engineers by automating time-consuming\ntasks. We further discuss how such framework can be inte-\ngrated pragmatically within common DAW software.\n627Oral Session 7: Structure Analysis and Mixing\n2. RELATED WORK\nAt the application level, alignment techniques were already\nintroduced in the literature in [3]. Alignment of audio to\nthe symbolic representation of a piece was integrated into\nthe workÔ¨Çow, permitting the automation of the editing pro-\ncess through operations such as pitch and timing correc-\ntions. The application of these approaches is precluded in\nthe present context by the requirement of accessing a sym-\nbolic representation of the music. Nonetheless, despite this\nlimitation, the work provides important insights in the inte-\ngration within a DAW setup.\nAt the technological level, audio alignment has often been\nthe subject of extensive research; an overview of classical\napproaches in literature can be found in [6]. In contrast to\ntraditional methods, an important aspect of this work is the\nconsideration of partial results and detection of interest re-\ngions . An audio alignment method with similar aims was\nintroduced in [7], that explicitly deals with the synchroniza-\ntion of recordings that have different structural forms.\n3. GENERAL ARCHITECTURE\nThe proposed methodology was devised assuming that a\ngeneric algorithm is available that is capable of aligning\naudio sequences without a known starting position. Even\nthough methods such as HMM or DTW [4] could have been\nused for this aim, we chose to exploit our previous work [6]\non sequential Montecarlo inference because of its straight-\nforward applicability to the present context, its Ô¨Çexibility\nregarding the degree of accuracy given by the availability of\nsmoothing algorithms and the possibility to trade accuracy\nfor computational efÔ¨Åciency in an direct way.\nIn the Ô¨Årst phase a rough alignment is produced as in Fig-\nure 2(a); the initial uncertainty in the alignment is due to the\nfact that the initial position is not known a priori. In a second\nphase we identify a sufÔ¨Åciently long region of the alignment\nthat can be reasonably approximated by a straight line, as in\nFigure 2(b); this region intuitively corresponds to the ‚Äúcor-\nrect‚Äù section of the alignment. These two phases solve the\ntask of placing the takes along the reference (Figure 1).\nThe remaining steps address the tasks in which a more\naccurate alignment is required. In the third phase, the ini-\ntial portion of the alignment is corrected, starting from a\nposition inside the region found in the previous phase and\nusing a reversed variant of the alignment algorithm (Fig-\nure 2(c)). Finally, a reÔ¨Åned alignment is produced by ex-\nploiting a smoothing algorithm for sequential Montecarlo\ninference, as shown in Figure 2(d).\n4. METHODOLOGY\nThe four phases described in the previous section are high-\nlighted in Figure 2 and described below in detail.\n0 10 20 30 401900 1920 1940 1960\ntake time [s]reference time [s]p(x0) =U(0, L)(a) Initial alignment, using sequential Montecarlo inference.\n0 10 20 30 401900 1920 1940 1960\ntake time [s]reference time [s]convergence region\ninterest region\n(b) IdentiÔ¨Åcation of the interest region of the alignment.\n0 10 20 30 401900 1920 1940 1960\ntake time [s]reference time [s]p(x(b)\nB) = diag(1 ,‚àí1)p(xB|z0. . . z B)\n(c) Correction of the beginning of the alignment.\n0 10 20 30 401910 1930 1950\ntake time [s]reference time [s]\np(x(fb)\n0) = diag(1 ,‚àí1)p(x(b)\n0|zB. . . z 0)\n(d) Final alignment obtained using smoothed inference.\nFigure 2 . Alignment methodology.\n62812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4.1 Initial Alignment\nThe alignment problem is formulated as the tracking of an\ninput data stream along a reference, using motion equations.\n4.1.1 System State Representation\nThe system state is modeled as a two-dimensional random\nvariablex= (s,t), representing the current position in the\nreference audio and tempo respectively; sis measured in\nseconds and tis the speed ratio of the performances. The\nincoming signal processing frontend is based on spectral\nfeatures extracted from the FFT analysis of an overlapping,\nwindowed signal representation, with hop size ‚àÜT. In order\nto use sequential Montecarlo methods to estimate the hidden\nvariablexk= (sk,tk)using observation zkat time frame k,\nwe assume that the state evolution is Markovian.\n4.1.2 Observation Modeling\nLetp(zk|xk)denote the likelihood of observing an audio\nframezkof the take given the current position along the ref-\nerence performance sk. We consider a simple spectral sim-\nilarity measure, deÔ¨Åned as the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the power spectra at frame kof the take and at time\nskin the reference.\n4.1.3 System State Transition Modeling\nLetp(xk|xk‚àí1)denote the pdf for the state transition; we\nmake use of tempo estimation in the previous frame, assum-\ning that it does not change too quickly:\np(xk|xk‚àí1) =N(/bracketleftbiggsk\ntk/bracketrightbigg\n|¬µk,Œ£)\n¬µk=/bracketleftbiggsk‚àí1+ ‚àÜTtk‚àí1\ntk‚àí1/bracketrightbigg\nŒ£ =/bracketleftbiggœÉ2\ns‚àÜT 0\n0œÉ2\nt‚àÜT/bracketrightbigg\nIntuitively, this corresponds to a performance where tempo\nis rather steady but can Ô¨Çuctuate; the parameters œÉ2\ntandœÉ2\ns\ncontrol respectively the variability of tempo and the pos-\nsibility of local mismatches that do not affect the overall\ntempo estimate.\n4.1.4 Inference Algorithm\nSequential Montecarlo inference methods work by recur-\nsively approximating the current distribution of the system\nstate using the technique of Sequential Importance Sam-\npling: a random measure {xi\nk,wi\nk}Ns\ni=1is used to charac-\nterize the posterior pdf with a set of Nsparticles over the\nstate domain and associated weights, and is updated at each\ntime step as in Algorithm 1. In particular, q(xk|xk‚àí1,zk)is\nthe particle sampling function. In our implementation this\ncorresponds to the transition probability density function; in\nthis case the algorithm is known as condensation algorithm.An optional resampling step is used to address the de-\ngeneracy problem, common to particle Ô¨Åltering approaches;\nthis is discussed in detail in [1,5] and in the next paragraph.\nThe decoding of position and tempo is carried out by\ncomputing the expected value of the resulting random mea-\nsure (which is efÔ¨Åciently computed as E[xk] =/summationtextNs\ni=1xi\nkwi\nk).\nAlgorithm 1 : SIS Particle Filter - Update step\nfori= 1...N sdo\nsamplexi\nkaccording to q(xi\nk|xi\nk‚àí1,zk)\nÀÜwi\nk‚Üêwi\nk‚àí1p(zk|xi\nk)p(xi\nk|xi\nk‚àí1)\nq(xi\nk|xi\nk‚àí1,zk)\nwi\nk‚ÜêÀÜwi\nkP\njÀÜwj\nk‚àÄi= 1...N s\nNeff‚Üê(/summationtextNs\ni=1(wi\nk)2)‚àí1\nifNeff<resampling threshold then\nresamplex1\nk...xNs\nkaccording to ddf w1\nk...wNs\nk\nwi\nk‚ÜêN‚àí1\ns‚àÄi= 1...N s\n4.1.5 Initialization\nInitialization plays a central role in the performance of the\nalgorithm; in a probabilistic context this corresponds to an\nappropriate choice of the prior distribution p(x0).\nIn a real-time setup the player is expected to start the per-\nformance at a well known point of the reference; this fact is\nexploited in the design of the algorithm by setting an appro-\npriately shaped prior distribution, typically a low-variance\none around the beginning.\nIn the proposed situation however the initial point is not\nknown (it represents indeed the aim of our interest). To cope\nwith this, the prior distribution p(x0)is set to be uniform\nover the whole duration Lof the reference performance; the\nalgorithm is expected to ‚Äúconverge‚Äù to the correct position\nafter a few iterations. Figure 3 shows the evolution of the\nprobability distribution for the position of the input at dif-\nferent moments of the alignment.\n4.1.6 Degeneracy Issues w.r.t. Realtime Alignment\nA relevant parameter of Algorithm 1 is the resampling thresh-\nold. The variable Neff, commonly known as effective sam-\nple size , is used to estimate the degree of degeneracy which\naffects the random measure; degeneracy is related to the\nvariance of the weights {wi\nk}Ns\n1, and it is proven to be al-\nways increasing in absence of resampling. In a degenerate\nsituation most particles have close-to-zero weight, resulting\nin most of the computation being spent in updating parti-\ncles which are subject to numerical approximation errors.\nResampling is introduced to obviate this issue. Intuitively,\nresampling replaces a random measure of the true distribu-\ntion with an equivalent one (in the limit of Ns‚Üí‚àû ) that is\nbetter suited for the inference algorithm. Since resampling\n629Oral Session 7: Structure Analysis and Mixing\nref. time [s]0 100 200 300 400 500 600(a) prior distribution ( k= 0)\nref. time [s]0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n(b)k= 1\nref. time [s]0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n(c)k= 10\nref. time [s]125 130 135 140\n(d)k= 50\nFigure 3 . Evolution of p(sk|z1...zk).\nintroduces other problems (in particular, sample impover-\nishment , i.e., a small number of particles is selected multi-\nple times) its usage should be limited, thus producing the\nnecessity for a threshold on the effective sample size.\nIn the real-time score following case [6] the mass of the\ndistribution is always concentrated around a small region\nof the domain thus allowing the resampling threshold to be\nrelatively low. In contrast, in a situation such as the one\ndepicted in Figure 3, the sparsity of the distribution in the\ninitial phases of the alignment imposes a much higher re-\nsampling threshold, otherwise many relevant hypotheses are\nsoon lost in the resampling phase and cannot be recovered.\n4.2 IdentiÔ¨Åcation of the Interest Region\nThis phase aims at identifying a region of the alignment ob-\ntained previously where it is certain that the alignment is\nindeed ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù. As depicted in Figure 2(b), a typical align-\nment can be subdivided into two regions, the Ô¨Årst one being\ncharacterized by irregular oscillations (because not enough\ndata has been observed yet in order to select the most proba-\nble hypothesis with enough conÔ¨Ådence) and the second one\nresembling a straight line; we will refer to the former as\nconvergence region and to the latter as interest region .\nAs can be inferred by observing the plot in Figure 2(b),\nthe most important characteristic of the interest region is its\nslope. From a technical point of view, the slope should be\nas constant as possible for the alignment region to be sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant. From a musical perspective it should be roughly\nunitary, implying that the performance tempos of the single\ntake and the reference are approximately the same. In ad-\ndition to that, the duration of the interest region should be\nlong enough to discard noisy sections of the alignment.\nThe interest region is identiÔ¨Åed in the following man-\n0 10 20 30 40\ntake time[s]reference time[s]\n1920 1940 1960 1980Figure 4 .

The process described above is depicted in Figure 4\n(dashed horizontal lines represent the regions progressively\nexamined by the algorithm) and formalized in Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2 : IdentiÔ¨Åcation of interest region\nw1,...,w W‚Üêregularly spaced intervals in [0,L]\ncandidates‚Üê‚àÖ fori= 1...W do\nwhile|wi|<L do\nwi‚Üêmax(0,wstart\ni‚àí‚àÜT),min(L,wend\ni+‚àÜT)\nai‚Üêslope of LS-Ô¨Åt line for points in wi\nei‚Üêmean difference with LS-Ô¨Åt line in wi\nifai‚àà[1‚àí‚àÜA,1 + ‚àÜA]‚à©ei<‚àÜEthen\ncandidates‚Üêcandidates‚à™i\nelse\nbreak\nif|candidates|>0then\ninterest region‚Üê max\ni‚ààcandidateswi\nelse\nalignment is incorrect\n4.3 Correction of the Convergence Region\nIn order to Ô¨Åx the convergence region of the alignment, we\nexploit again the sequential Montecarlo inference method-\nology of 4.1, with some adaptations. The general idea is\nto run the algorithm ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, i.e., to align the time-\nreversed audio streams, starting from a point in the previous\nalignment that is known to be correct.\nThe starting point Bis chosen inside the region of in-\nterest. The prior distribution for the backward alignment\nis equal to that of the forward alignment at B, however\nwith the value of the velocity for each particle inverted:\np(x(b)\nB) =diag(1,‚àí1)p(xB|z0...zB). The audio stream of\n63012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nthe take is then reversed and processed by Algorithm 1, as in\nFigure 2(c). Experimentation shows that a narrow uniform\nor gaussian prior centered in (B,‚àí1)Tare for practical pur-\nposes equivalent to the form of p(x(b)\nB)mentioned above.\n4.4 Smoothing Inference\nSequential Montecarlo inference algorithms are typically for\nonline estimation; this implies that at each instant only the\ninformation about the past is exploited, instead of the whole\nobservation sequence. In the context of an ofÔ¨Çine appli-\ncation however these real-time constraints can be dropped.\nBoth the Forward/Backward and Viterbi inference algorithms\ncan be deduced, respectively estimating the probability dis-\ntribution at each instant given the full observation sequence\nand the Maximum A Posteriori alignment. The running time\nof both algorithms is quadratic in the number of particles,\nhowever this issue can be mitigated by an appropriate choice\nof the prior distribution p(x(fb)\n0)such as a resampling of\ndiag(1,‚àí1)p(x(b)\n0)with a smaller numer of samples.\n5. EV ALUATION\nAn ideal evaluation of the efÔ¨Åcacy of the proposed method-\nology in the context discussed in Section 1 should aim at\nmeasuring the amount of work saved in production with re-\nspect to the current workÔ¨Çow. A discussion of our current\nwork in this area is presented in Section 6.\nBelow we evaluate the efÔ¨Åcacy of the proposed approach\nregarding the initial phase of laying out the takes as in Fig-\nure 1. The accuracy of the alignment in terms of latency and\naverage error was evaluated in our previous work [6]; a sim-\nilar analysis could not be performed in this case, due to the\nlack of a (manually annotated) reference linking the timings\nof each musical event for all takes to the reference record-\ning. Moreover, in this situation the aim is rather to position\ncorrectly the highest number of takes against the reference,\nrather than to align them with the highest possible precision.\n5.1 Dataset description\nWe collected the recordings produced in two real-life ses-\nsions by different groups of sound engineers, consisting of\napproximately 3 hours of audio data. The Ô¨Årst one is a\nrecording session of the second movement of J. Brahms‚Äô\nsextet op. 18; the second one was produced shortly after the\npremiere of P. Manoury‚Äôs ‚ÄúTensio‚Äù, for string quartet and\nlive electronics, in December 2010. Table 1 summarizes\ntheir characteristics.\n5.2 Experimental Results\nWe performed the alignment of each take in the two databases\naccording to the procedure introduced in Section 4. We se-\nlect the center point of the interest region identiÔ¨Åed in thedataset n. of rec. duration [s]\nref. takes (avg,std) total\nBrahms 20 + ref. 588.8 112.8, 92.0 2844.0\nManoury 49 + ref. 2339.4 113.5, 94.0 7900.4\nTable 1 . Datasets used for evaluation.\nsecond phase as the alignment reference for the whole take\n(we do not performs the optional two last steps).\nIn all the test we executed, we set the number of particles\nNsto be proportional to the duration of the reference (60\nparticles per second). Our implementation aligns a minute\nof audio in 2.29s for Ns= 105on a laptop computer with a\n2.4 Ghz Intel i5 processor (a single core is used).\n5.2.1 Brahms Dataset\nFor this dataset, a manual placement of all the takes with\nrespect to the reference recording was performed using a\nmusical score, in order to evaluate the correctness of the au-\ntomatic procedure. Aural inspection of the data showed that\nnone of the recordings but one presented undesired noises.\nAll the takes but one were correctly aligned. In the un-\nsuccessful case, the length of the recording itself was one\nsecond shorter than the minimum length for an interest re-\ngion (15s); using last alignment point as a reference, the\nplacement of this take also results to be correct.\n5.2.2 Manoury Dataset\nThe dataset contains a complete run-through and 49sepa-\nrate takes. The particularity of this dataset is the presence\nof undesired material for the Ô¨Ånal mix in many of the indi-\nvidual takes (such as speech, practice sessions, volume and\ncalibration tests). Out of 49takes, 14contain exclusively\nnoise and 21partially. In the former case we consider the\nalignment correct if the Ô¨Åle is discarded, in the latter we aim\nat aligning correctly the interesting portion of the take. This\nis in sharp contrast with the ‚Äúcleanness‚Äù of the Brahms set\nand presents difÔ¨Åculties that were not foreseen when formu-\nlating the alignment procedure.\nContrarily to the Brahms dataset, the evaluation of the\nalignment precision was done a posteriori: instead of per-\nforming a manual alignment in advance, the results of the\nautomatic alignment were checked. The reason for this lies\nbehind the length (approximately 40 minutes) and complex-\nity of the music: even with the score at our disposal, it was\nimmediately evident that a manual alignment would have\ntaken a very long time. It is precisely this difÔ¨Åculty that\nsound engineers had to face.\nOur Ô¨Årst experiment aligning this dataset yielded rather\npoor results on the 21Ô¨Åles containing noise regions of sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant length (in some cases up to more than one minute);\nsince in almost all cases the noisy portion was at the begin-\nning, we decided to directly align the reversed audio streams\n631Oral Session 7: Structure Analysis and Mixing\nin the Ô¨Årst phase. With this simple adaptation the results are\nas follows: of the 35Ô¨Åles containing interesting regions, 26\nwere correctly aligned; all of the 14takes that contained ex-\nclusively noises were correctly discarded by the algorithm.\nThe absence of false positives (no noise-only takes were\nmistakenly aligned) and the correct positioning of all the\naligned Ô¨Åles suggest that the simple algorithm for identiÔ¨Å-\ncation of the interest region is robust enough to be applied\nto rather short audio segments, yielding the possibility of re-\npeating the alignment algorithm multiple times on different\nsubregions of the audio in order to avoid noisy sections.\n6. WORKFLOW ADAPTATION\nThe audio industry has established over the years common\nstandards for mixing that are adopted in most professional\nstudio records worldwide. Integration of new technologies\nwithin existing workÔ¨Çow therefore requires special attention\nto existing practices within the community. To this end, we\nconducted several interviews with sound engineers.\nFrom an R&D standpoint, an ideal integration would be\na direct implementation of this technology into the graphi-\ncal user interface of common DAW softwares to maximize\nusability. Such integration would allow novel possibilities,\nsuch as linking two tracks by means of their alignment and\ndeÔ¨Åning the placement of transition points between them\nfor crossfading, avoiding any destructive editing regarding\nthe discarded audio regions. Such integration requires di-\nrect contact with software houses which are mostly close to\npublic domain development.\nAn alternative solution is represented by standalone align-\nment tools, whose outputs should be directly importable into\na commercial DAW. Virtually all the major DAWs and video\npost production systems support the Open Media Frame-\nwork (OMF) and the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF),\nrespectively owned by Avid Technology, Inc. and by the\nAdvanced Media WorkÔ¨Çow Association (AMWA)1. These\nare employed as interchange formats to allow interoperabil-\nity between different software. An alignment software, that\nwe are currently developing, could automatically construct\nan initial session using an interchange format that audio en-\ngineers can use in their DAW to start the mixing process.\n7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we attempted to address two issues: Intro-\nducing novels tools generalizing audio matching algorithms\nto partial alignment with relevant region detection, and their\nintegration within realistic studio mixing procedure to accel-\nerate mixing session preparation for audio engineers. The\nÔ¨Årst task involves adapting audio alignment techniques to\nsituations where there is no speciÔ¨Åc prior knowledge on the\n1http://www.avid.com ,http://www.amwa.tvstarting point of the alignment. Such considerations would\nallow audio engineers to automatically obtain a global view\nof many different individual takes with regards to a refer-\nence run-through recording in a typical recording session, as\nwell as providing access to relevant parts within each take;\nthis is a time-consuming task if done manually. We further\ndiscussed how this procedure can realistically be integrated\ninto common mixing workÔ¨Çows.\nApplications of the proposed technology are not limited\nto the preparation of the initial mixing session: mid-level in-\nformation obtained during the alignment task can in fact be\nfurther integrated in a studio mixing workÔ¨Çow. For exam-\nple, our audio alignment provides useful information about\nthetempo of a performance with regards to the reference\nthat can be employed as an important factor for the mix-\ning engineer. Such integration requires further collaboration\nwith audio engineers to determine an optimal exploitation of\nthese informations in the context of existing practices.\n8. REFERENCES\n[1] M. S.

INTRODUCTION\nIt is a well-known phenomenon that human perception of\npitch is periodic in the sense that two pitches are perceived\nas similar in ‚Äúcolor‚Äù if they differ by an octave. Based on\nthis observation, a pitch can be separated into two com-\nponents, which are referred to as tone height andchroma,\nsee [19]. Assuming the equal-tempered scale, the chromas\ncorrespondto the set {C,C‚ôØ,D,...,B}that consists of the\ntwelve pitch spelling attributes1as used in Western music\nnotation. Thus, a chroma feature is represented by a 12-\ndimensional vector x= (x(1),x(2),...,x(12))T, where\nx(1)corresponds to chroma C,x(2)to chroma C‚ôØ, and so\n1Notethat intheequal-tempered scaledifferent pitch spell ings such C‚ôØ\nandD‚ô≠refer to the samechroma.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage an d that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.\nCP\nCLP\nCENS\nCRPAudio\nrepresentationPitch\nrepresentationChroma\nrepresentationTuning\nestimationMultirate\npitch\nÔ¨ÅlterbankSmoothing\nLogarithmic\ncompressionQuantization\nReduction\nNormalization\nFigure1. Overviewofthefeatureextractionpipeline.\non. In the feature extraction step, a given audio signal is\nconvertedinto a sequence of chromafeatureseach express-\ning how the short-time energy of the signal is spread over\nthetwelvechromabands.\nIdentifying pitches that differ by an octave, chroma fea-\ntures show a high degree of robustness to variations in\ntimbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of har-\nmony. This is the reason why chroma-based audio fea-\ntures, sometimes also referred to as pitch class proÔ¨Åles, ar e\na well-established tool for processing and analyzing music\ndata [1, 5, 12]. For example, basically every chord recog-\nnition procedure relies on some kind of chroma represen-\ntation [2, 4, 11]. Also, chroma features have become the\nde facto standard for tasks such as music synchronization\nand alignment [7, 8, 12], as well as audio structure analy-\nsis [16]. Finally, chroma features have turned out to be a\npowerful mid-level feature representation in content-bas ed\naudio retrieval such as cover song identiÔ¨Åcation [3, 18] or\naudiomatching[10,15].\nTherearemanywaysforcomputingchroma-basedaudio\nfeatures. For example, the conversion of an audio record-\ning into a chroma representation (or chromagram) may be\nperformed either by using short-time Fourier transforms in\ncombination with binning strategies [1] or by employing\nsuitable multirate Ô¨Ålter banks [12]. Furthermore, the prop -\nerties of chroma features can be signiÔ¨Åcantly changed by\n215Poster Session 2\nintroducingsuitable pre-and post-processingsteps modif y-\ningspectral,temporal,anddynamicalaspects. Thisleadst o\nalargenumberofchromavariants,whichmayshowaquite\ndifferentbehaviorinthecontextofaspeciÔ¨Åcmusicanalysi s\nscenario.\nIn this paper, we introducea chromatoolbox, which has\nrecently been released undera GNU-GPL license, see [13].\nThis well-documented toolbox contains MATLAB imple-\nmentations for extracting various types of recently intro-\nduced pitch-based and chroma-based audio features (re-\nferred to as Pitch,CP,CLP,CENS, andCRP), see also Fig-\nure 1 for an overview. In Section 2, we give a short sum-\nmary on how the various feature types are computed while\ndiscussing the role of the most important parameters that\ncanbeusedtomodifythefeatures‚Äôcharacteristics. Then,i n\nSection 3, we describe the functions of the toolbox for fea-\ntureextraction,visualization,andpost-processing. One par-\nticular goal of this paper is to emphasize the importance of\nthe feature design step by showingthat the results of a spe-\nciÔ¨Åc music analysis task may crucially depend on the used\nchromatype. Tothisend,wediscussin Section4two illus-\ntrative example applications, namely chord recognitionan d\naudiomatching.\n2. FEATURE EXTRACTION\nInthissection,wegiveanoverviewonhowthevariousfea-\nture types contained in the chroma toolbox are computed.\nAs illustration, Figure 3 shows the resulting feature repre -\nsentationsforanaudiorecordingoftheÔ¨Årstsixmeasuresof\nOp.100,No.2 byFriedrichBurgm¬® uller.\n2.1 PitchRepresentation\nAs basis for the chroma feature extraction, we Ô¨Årst decom-\npose a given audio signal into 88frequency bands with\ncenter frequencies corresponding to the pitches A0toC8\n(MIDI pitches p= 21top= 108). To obtain a sufÔ¨Å-\ncient spectral resolution for the lower frequencies, one ei -\nther needs a low sampling rate or a large temporal win-\ndow. Inourtoolbox,weemployaconstant QmultirateÔ¨Ålter\nbank using a sampling rate of 22050 Hz for high pitches,\n4410 Hz for medium pitches, and 882 Hzfor low pitches,\nsee [12] for details. The employed pitch Ô¨Ålters possess a\nrelativelywide passband,while still properlyseparating ad-\njacent notes thanks to sharp cutoffs in the transition bands ,\nsee Figure 2. Actually, the pitch Ô¨Ålters are robust to devia-\ntions of up to ¬±25cents2from the respective note‚Äôscenter\nfrequency. Toavoidlargephasedistortions,weuseforward -\nbackward Ô¨Åltering such that the resulting output signal has\npreciselyzerophasedistortionandamagnitudemodiÔ¨Åedby\nthesquareoftheÔ¨Ålter‚Äôsmagnituderesponse,see [17].\n2Thecentis a logarithmic unit to measure musical intervals.

The shown Ô¨Ålters correspond to M IDI\npitchesp‚àà[69 : 93](withrespect tothe sampling rate 4410 Hz).\nIn the next step, for each of the 88pitch subbands, we\ncompute the short-time mean-square power (i.e., the sam-\nplesofeachsubbandoutputaresquared)usingawindowof\na Ô¨Åxed length and an overlap of 50 %. For example, using\na window length of 200 millisecondsleads to a feature rate\nof10 Hz(10features per second). The resulting features,\nwhich we denote as Pitch, measure the short-time energy\ncontent of the audio signal within each pitch subband. We\nrefertoFigure3cforanillustrationandto[12]fordetails .\n2.2 Tuning\nTo account for the global tuning of a recording, one needs\ntosuitablyshiftthecenterfrequenciesofthesubband-Ô¨Ålt ers\nof the multirate Ô¨Ålter bank. To this end, we compute an\naverage spectrogram vector and derive an estimate for the\ntuning deviation by simulating the Ô¨Ålterbank shifts using\nweighted binning techniquessimilar to [5]. In our toolbox,\nwe have pre-computed six different multirate Ô¨Ålter banks\ncorresponding to a shift of œÉ‚àà/braceleftbig\n0,1\n4,1\n3,1\n2,2\n3,3\n4/bracerightbig\nsemi-\ntones, respectively. From these Ô¨Ålter banks, the most suit-\nable one is chosen according to the estimated tuning devia-\ntion.\n2.3 CPFeature\nFrom the pitch representation, one obtains a chroma repre-\nsentationsimplybyaddingupthecorrespondingvaluesthat\nbelong to the same chroma. For example, to compute the\nentry corresponding to chroma C, one adds up values cor-\nresponding to the musical pitches C1, C2, ..., C8 (MIDI\npitchesp= 24,36,...,108). For each window, this yields\na12-dimensional vector x= (x(1),x(2),...,x(12))T,\nwherex(1)corresponds to chroma C,x(2)to chroma C‚ôØ,\nandsoon. Theresultingfeaturesarereferredtoas Chroma-\nPitchanddenotedby CP, see Figure3d.\n2.4 Normalization\nTo achieve invariance in dynamics, one can normalize\nthe features with respect to some suitable norm. In\nthe following, we only consider the ‚Ñìp-norm deÔ¨Åned by\n||x||p:=/parenleftbig/summationtext12\ni=1|x(i)|p/parenrightbig1/pfor a given chroma vector x=\n(x(1),x(2),...,x(12))Tand some natural number p‚ààN.\n21612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTo avoidrandomenergydistributionsoccurringduringpas-\nsages of very low energy (e.g., passages of silence before\nthe actual start of the recording or during long pauses), we\nreplace a chroma vector xby the uniform vector of norm\none in case ||x||pfalls below a certain threshold. Note that\nthecasep= 2yieldstheEuclideannormandthecase p= 1\nthe Manhattan norm. If not speciÔ¨Åed otherwise, all chroma\nvectors to be considered are normalized with respect to the\nEuclideannorm,see alsoFigure3e.\n2.5 CLP Features\nTo account for the logarithmic sensation of sound inten-\nsity [20], one often applies a logarithmic amplitude com-\npression when computing audio features. To this end, each\nenergyvalues eofthepitchrepresentationisreplacedbythe\nvaluelog(Œ∑¬∑e+1),whereŒ∑isa suitablepositiveconstant.\nThen, the chromavaluesare computedas explainedin Sec-\ntion 2.3. The resulting features, which depend on the com-\npression parameter Œ∑, are referred to as Chroma-Log-Pitch\nand denoted by CLP[Œ∑], see Figure 3f. Note that a similar\nÔ¨Çatteningeffectcanbeachievedbyspectralwhiteningtech -\nniques, where the pitch subbandsare normalized according\nto short-timevariancesinthesubbands[5, 9].\n2.6 CENS Features\nAddingafurtherdegreeofabstractionbyconsideringshort -\ntime statistics over energy distributions within the chrom a\nbands, one obtains CENS(Chroma Energy Normalized\nStatistics) features, which constitute a family of scalabl e\nand robust audio features. These features have turned out\nto be very useful in audio matching and retrieval applica-\ntions [10, 15]. In computing CENSfeatures, each chroma\nvector is Ô¨Årst normalized with respect to the ‚Ñì1-norm thus\nexpressingrelativeenergydistribution. Then,aquantiza tion\nisappliedbasedonsuitablychosenthresholds. Here,choos -\ningthresholdsinalogarithmicfashionintroducessomekin d\noflogarithmiccompressionasabove,see[15]fordetails. I n\na subsequent step, the features are further smoothed over a\nwindow of length w‚ààNand downsampled by a factor of\nd, see Section 2.8. The resulting features are normalized\nwithrespecttothe ‚Ñì2-normanddenotedby CENSw\nd,see also\nFigure3gandFigure3hforillustrations.\n2.7 CRPFeatures\nTo boost the degree of timbre invariance, a novel family of\nchroma-based audio features has been introduced in [14].\nThe general idea is to discard timbre-related information\nas is captured by the lower mel-frequency cepstral coef-\nÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs).

These vectors are referred to\nas CRP (Chroma DCT-Reduced log Pitch) features. The\nupper coefÔ¨Åcients to be kept are speciÔ¨Åed by a parameter\nn‚àà[1 : 120]. As reported in [14], the parameter n= 55\nyields good results and constitutesour default stetting. T he\nresultingfeaturesaredenotedby CRP[n],seeFigure3i. Note\nthat opposed to the previously introduced chroma variants,\nCRP featuresmayhavenegativeentries.\n2.8 Smoothing\nAs already mentioned in Section 2.6, one can further pro-\ncessthevariouschromavariantsbyapplyingsmoothingand\ndownsampling operations. For example, subsequent vec-\ntors of a feature sequences can be averaged using a slid-\ning windowofsize w(givenin frames)andthendownsam-\npled by a factor d. Starting with CENS,CP,CLP[Œ∑], and\nCRP[n], the resulting features are denoted by CENSw\nd,CPw\nd,\nCLP[Œ∑]w\nd, andCRP[n]w\nd, respectively. Even though being a\nsimple strategy,smoothingcan havea signiÔ¨Åcantimpacton\nthefeatures‚Äôbehaviorwithinamusicanalysistasks. Forex -\nample, as reported in [15], the temporal blurring of CENS\nfeatures makes audio matching more robust to local tempo\nvariations. Furthermore,using the parameters wandd, one\nobtains a computationally inexpensive procedure to simu-\nlate tempo changes on the feature level. We illustrate this\nby means of a concrete example. Suppose, we start with a\nchromarepresentationhavinga feature rate of 10Hz. Then\nusingw= 41andd= 10, one obtains one chroma vector\nper second, each covering roughly 4100 ms of the original\naudio signal. Now, using w= 53(instead of w= 41) and\nd= 13(instead of d= 10) results in a temporally scaled\nversionofthefeaturessequencesimulatinga tempochange\nof10/13‚âà0.77. Such tempo change strategies have been\nappliedsuccessfullyinthe contextofaudioindexing[10].3. TOOLBOX\nThefeatureextractioncomponentsasdescribedinSection2\nform the core of our chroma toolbox, which is freely avail-\nable at the well-documented website [13] under a GNU-\nGPL license. Table 1 gives an overview of the main MAT-\nLAB functions along with the most important parameters.\nNote that there are many more parameters not discussed in\nthispaper. However,forallparameterstherearedefaultse t-\ntings so that none of the parametersneed to be speciÔ¨Åed by\ntheuser.\nTodemonstratehowourtoolboxcanbeapplied,wenow\ndiscuss the code example3shown in Table 2. Our example\nstarts with a call to the function wav_to_audio , which is a\nsimplewrapperaroundMATLAB‚Äôs wavread.m andconverts\nthe input WAV Ô¨Åle into a mono version at a sampling rate\nof22050Hz. Furthermore, the struct sideinfo is returned\ncontaining meta information about the WAV Ô¨Åle. In line\n3, the audio data is processed by estimateTuning , which\ncomputes an appropriate Ô¨Ålter bank shift œÉfor the record-\ning. Next,inlines 5‚Äì9,Pitchfeaturesarecomputed. Here,\nthe struct paramPitch is used to pass optional parameters\nto the feature extraction function. If some parameters or\nthe whole struct are not set manually, then meaningful de-\nfault settings are used. This is a general principle through -\nout the toolbox. For the pitch computation, winLenSTMSP\nspeciÔ¨Åes the window length in samples. Here, 4410to-\ngether with a sampling frequency of 22050Hz results in\na window length corresponding to 200ms of audio. Using\nhalf-overlapped windows leads to a feature rate of 10 Hz.\nThe Ô¨Ålterbank shift is speciÔ¨Åed in line 6using the output\nofestimateTuning .

In most automated\nchord recognition procedures, the given music recording is\nÔ¨Årst converted into a sequence of chroma-based audio fea-\ntures and then pattern matching techniques are applied to\nmapthechromafeaturesto chordlabels.\nWe now demonstrate by a small experiment, how the Ô¨Å-\nnalrecognitionratessubstantiallydependontheunderlyi ng\nchromarepresentationandparametersthatcontroltempora l\nand spectral aspects. To this end, we revert to three differ-\nent pattern matching techniques. The Ô¨Årst two approaches\naresimpletemplate-basedapproaches,referredtoas Tband\nTa, where the Ô¨Årst approach uses data-independent binary\ntemplates and the second one data-dependent average tem-\nplates. As third approach,we employhiddenMarkovmod-\nels denoted by HMM. Using the annotated Beatles dataset\nas described in [6], which consists of 180Beatles songs,\nwe computed recognition rates based on conventional F-\nmeasures using 3-fold cross validation. Figure 4 shows the\nrecognition rates for the three pattern matching technique s\nin combinationwith differentchromavariants.\nAs these experimental results indicate, the used chroma\nrepresentationcan have a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on the chord\nrecognition accuracy. In particular, a logarithmic com-\npression step in the chroma extraction turns out to be cru-\ncial. Furthermore, the results reveal that temporal featur e\nsmoothing plays an important role in chord recognition‚Äì\nin particular for recognizers that work in a purely frame-\n0.350.40.450.50.550.60.650.70.750.8\n  \nTb\nTa\nHMM\nFeature typesF-measure\nCP CLP[100] CENS1\n1CENS11\n1CRP[55]CRP[55]11\n1\nFigure 4.Dependency of the recognition rates (F-measures) of\ndifferent chord recognition procedures on the used chroma v ariant\n(using a Beatlesdataset and 3-foldcross validation).\n219Poster Session 2\nwise fashion.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic structureanalysisconstitutesa fundamentalresear ch\ntopic within the Ô¨Åeld of music information retrieval. One\nmajor goalof structureanalysisis to dividea music record-\ning into temporal segments corresponding to musical parts\nand then to group these segments into musically meaning-\nful categories [10]. Such segments may refer to chorus or\nverse sections of a popular piece of music, to stanzas of a\nfolk song, or to the Ô¨Årst theme, the second theme or the\nentire exposition of a symphony. Such important musical\nparts are often characterized by the property of being re-\npeated several times throughout the piece. Therefore, Ô¨Ånd-\ningtherepetitivestructureofamusicrecordingisanimpor -\ntant and well-studied subtask within structure analysis, s ee,\ne.g.,[1,2,5,6,9]andtheoverviewarticles[3,10].

Actually,audiosegment s\nthatrefertothesamemusicalpartmaydiffersigniÔ¨Åcantlyi n\nparameterssuch as dynamics, instrumentation,articulati on,\nandtemponottospeakofpronouncedmusicalvariations. In\nsuch cases, structure analysis becomes a hard and ill-posed\ntask withmanyyetunsolvedproblems.\nIn this paper, we address the problem of Ô¨Ånding the\nmostrepresentativeandrepetitivesegmentofagivenmusic\nrecordings, a task often referred to as audio thumbnailing ,\nsee, e.g., [1]. Here, opposed to most of the previous ap-\nproaches we want to admit even strong musical variations.\nAs our main contribution, we introduce a Ô¨Åtness measure\nthatassignstoeachaudiosegmentaÔ¨Åtnessvaluethatsimul-\ntaneouslycapturestwoaspects. Firstly,itindicates howwell\nthe given segment explains other similar segments (‚Äúpreci-\nsions‚Äù) and, secondly, it indicates how much of the overall\nmusicrecordingsiscoveredbyallthesesegments(‚Äúrecall‚Äù ).\nFurthermore, our Ô¨Åtness measure is normalized and disre-\ngardstrivialself-explanations(reÔ¨Çexiverelations). As afur-\nthercontributionofthispaper,weintroduceacompacttime -\nlagrepresentationthatyieldsahigh-levelviewonthestru c-\ntural properties for the entire music recording. First expe r-\niments shows that our Ô¨Åtness measure, in combinationwith\nenhancedfeaturerepresentations,cancopewithevenstron g\nvariations in tempo, instrumentation, and modulations tha t\noccurwithinandacrossthesegments.\nAt this point, we want to note that our work has been\ninspired by Paulus and Klapuri [9], even though the task\nandconceptsofthispaperarefundamentallydifferentto[9 ].\nTheÔ¨Åtnessmeasureintroducedin[9]expressespropertieso f\nanentire structure , whereas our Ô¨Åtness measure expresses\nproperties of a single segment . In assigning a Ô¨Åtness value\ntoagivensegment,ourideaistosimultaneouslyaccountfor\nall itsexistingrelationswithinthe entirerecording.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In\nSection 2, we give a motivation of our approach, Ô¨Åx some\nnotation, and quickly review the concept of self-similarit y\nmatrices. InSection3,asourmaincontribution,wedescrib e\nthe technical details on the construction of our Ô¨Åtness mea-\nsure. Finally, experimentalresults and an outlook on futur e\nworkcanbefoundin Section4andSection5,respectively.\n615Oral Session 7: Structure Analysis and Mixing\n2. MOTIVATION ANDNOTATION\nIn the following, we distinguish between a piece of music\n(in an abstract sense) and a particular audio recording (a\nconcreteperformance)ofthepiece. Theterm partisusedin\nthe context of the abstract music domain, whereas the term\nsegmentisusedfortheaudiodomain[10]. Musicalpartsare\noftendenotedbytheletters A,B,C,... intheorderoftheir\nÔ¨Årstoccurrence. Forexample,thesequence A1A2B1A3de-\nscribes the musical form consisting of three repeating A-\nparts interleaved with one B-part. Then, for a given music\nrecording of such a piece, the goal of the structure analysis\nproblem as tackled in this paper would be to Ô¨Ånd the seg-\nmentswithinthe recordingthat correspondto the A-parts.\nMostrepetition-basedapproachestoaudiostructureanal-\nysis proceed as follows. In the Ô¨Årst step, the music record-\ning is transformed into a sequence X:= (x1,x2,...,x N)\nof feature vectors xn‚àà F,1‚â§n‚â§N, whereFde-\nnotes a suitable feature space. In the second step, based on\na similarity measure s:F √ó F ‚Üí R, one deÔ¨Ånes a self-\nsimilarity matrix S ‚ààRN√óNbyS(n,m) :=s(xn,xm),\n1‚â§n,m‚â§N. In the following,a tuple p= (n,m)‚àà[1 :\nN]2is called a cellofS, and the value S(n,m)is referred\nto as thescoreof the cell p. The crucial observation is that\nrepeatingpatternsinthefeaturesequence Xappearasdiag-\nonal ‚Äústripes‚Äù in S[2, 10]. Moreprecisely,these stripesare\npaths of cells of high score running in parallel to the main\ndiagonal. Therefore, in the third step, one extracts all suc h\npaths from S, where each path encodes the similarity of a\npairofsegments. (Thesetwosegmentsaregivenbythetwo\nprojectionsofthepathontothetwoaxisof S,seeFigure1.)\nIn the fourth step, from the given pairwise relations of seg-\nments, one derives entire groups of segments, where each\ngroup comprises all segments of a given type of a musical\npart(e.g. all segmentscorrespondingto A-parts). Thisstep\ncanbethoughtofformingsomekindoftransitiveclosureof\nthe given path relations [3, 6]. However, this groupingpro-\ncess constitutes a main challenge when the extracted paths\nare erroneousand incomplete. In [5], a groupingprocess is\ndescribed that balances out inconsistenciesin the path rel a-\ntions by exploitinga constant tempo assumption. However,\nwhen dealing with music of varying tempo, the grouping\nprocessconstitutesa challengingresearchproblem.\nAs one main idea of our approach, we suggest to jointly\nperform the third and fourth step thus circumventing the\nseparate grouping process. We realize this idea by assign-\ning a Ô¨Åtness value to a givensegment in such a way that all\nrelatedsegmentssimultaneouslyinÔ¨ÇuencetheÔ¨Åtness value .\nTo express relations between segments, we will introduce\nthe notion of a path family, see Section 3.1. Intuitively, in -\nsteadofextractingindividualpaths,weextractentiregro ups\nof paths, where the consistency within a group is automati-\ncallyenforcedbythe construction.\n  \n50 100 150 200 250 30050100150200250300\n‚àí2‚àí1.5‚àí1‚àí0.500.51\nsŒ±tœÄ1\n1œÄ1\n2œÄ1\n3\nœÄ1œÄ2œÄ3\nFigure 1.

Let\nX= (x1,x2,...,x N)be the feature representation of the\ngiven audio recording. A segmentŒ±is deÔ¨Åned to be a sub-\nsetŒ±= [s:t]‚äÜ[1 :N]speciÔ¨Åed by its starting point s\nand its end point t(given in terms of feature indices). Let\n|Œ±|:=t‚àís+ 1denote the length of Œ±. In our approach,\nwe introduce a Ô¨Åtness measure œïthat assigns to each seg-\nmentŒ±‚äÜ[1 :N]a Ô¨Åtnessvalue œï(Œ±)‚ààR. Intuitively,this\nÔ¨Åtness value should express to which extent the segment Œ±\n‚Äúexplains‚Äù the repetitive structure of X. In particular, the\nvalueœï(Œ±)shouldbelargeinthecasethattherepetitionsof\nŒ±coverlargeportionsof X,otherwiseit shouldbesmall.\nNext, we impose some normalization constraints on œï.\nNote that the segment Œ±= [1 :N]explains the entire se-\nquenceXperfectly. More generally, each segment Œ±ex-\nplains itself perfectly (this information is encoded by the\nmain diagonal of a self-similarity matrix). We do not want\nsuch trivial, reÔ¨Çexiveself-explanationsto becapturedby œï.\nTherefore,we require\n0‚â§œï(Œ±)‚â§N‚àí|Œ±|\nN. (1)\nIn particular, one obtains œï([1 :N]) = 0. More generally,\na valueœï(Œ±) = 0should mean that the segment Œ±only ex-\nplains itself but no other portions of X. As an illustrative\nexample,weconsideran‚Äúideal‚Äùrecordingofapieceofmu-\nsic having the form A1A2...AK. LetŒ±kbe the segment\ncorrespondingto Ak,k‚àà[1 :K]. ThenourÔ¨Åtnessmeasure\nshould assume the value œï(Œ±k) =K‚àí1\nKfor each segment\nŒ±k, see Figure1illustratingthecase K= 3.\n61612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n2.2 Self-SimilarityMatrices\nIn general, repeating segments may differ signiÔ¨Åcantly re-\ngarding tempo, instrumentation and other musical proper-\nties. Thedegreeofthesimilaritybetweentworepeatingseg -\nmentsŒ±andŒ±‚Ä≤crucially depends on the used feature type,\nthe similarity measure, and the resulting self-similarity ma-\ntrixS. Our Ô¨Åtness measure is generic in the sense that it\ncanworkwithgeneralself-similaritymatricesthatonlyfu l-\nÔ¨Åll some basic normalization properties. Actually, we only\nrequire the property S(n,m)‚â§1for1‚â§n,m‚â§Nand\nS(n,n) = 1forn‚àà[1 :N]. Since the construction of S\nis not in the focus of this paper, we only give a quick de-\nscription of the type of self-similarity matrix as used in ou r\nexperiments. Figure 2 illustrates the following steps. Fir st\nofall,weuseavariantofchroma-basedaudiofeaturesasde-\nscribed in [6, Section 3.3]. Normalizing these features, we\nsimply use the inner productas similarity measure yielding\na value between 0and1. To enhance structural properties,\nwe applytemporalsmoothingtechniquesthat can deal with\ntempo variations, see [6, Section 7.2]. Furthermore, apply -\ningtechniquesasdescribedin[7],weobtainatranspositio n-\ninvariant matrix that can deal with modulation differences\nwithin and across repeating parts. Subsequently, using a\nsuitable threshold parameter œÑ >0and a penalty param-\neterŒ¥‚â§0, we post-process the matrix by Ô¨Årst setting the\nscore values of all cells with a score below œÑto the value Œ¥\nand then by linearly scaling the range [œÑ: 1]to[0 : 1]. Fi-\nnally,weset S(n,n) = 1forn‚àà[1 :N](thispropertymay\nhave beenlost bythe smoothingstep). In the following,we\nchooseœÑin a relative fashion by keeping 25%of the cells\nhavingthe highestscoreandset Œ¥=‚àí2.\n3. FITNESS MEASURE\nFollowing the guidelines motivated in Section 2, we now\nintroduce our novel Ô¨Åtness measure. In assigning a Ô¨Åtness\nvalue to a given segment Œ±, our idea is to simultaneously\naccount for all other segments that are related to Œ±. To this\nend,inSection3.1,weintroducethenotationofapathfam-\nily that allows for expressing these relations. Then, in Sec -\ntion 3.2, we explain how each path family can be assigned\na coverage (‚Äúrecall‚Äù) as well as an average score measure\n(‚Äúprecisions‚Äù). The Ô¨Åtness of the segment Œ±is then deter-\nmined by the path family that simultaneously maximizes\ncoverageandscore.\n3.1 PathFamily\nLetX= (x1,x2,...,x N)be a feature sequence and Sa\nself-similarity matrix as introduced in Section 2.2.

Actually, at this poin t,\nwe only need the assumption that the given self-similarity\nmatrixS ‚ààRN√óNhas the property that S(n,m)‚â§1for\nallcells(n,m)‚àà[1 :N]2andS(n,n) = 1forn‚àà[1 :N].\nWe start by deÔ¨Åning the normalized score ¬Ø¬µ(P)of the path\nfamilyPoverŒ±by\n¬Ø¬µ(P) :=¬µ(P)‚àí|Œ±|/summationtextK\nk=1Lk, (6)\nwhereLkdeÔ¨Ånesthelengthofpath œÄk. Here,themotivation\nforsubtractingthelength |Œ±|ofŒ±isthatthesegment Œ±triv-\nially explains itself, see Section 2. It is not hard to see tha t\nthe score ¬Ø¬µfulÔ¨Ålls the conditions(1). From the assumption\nS(n,n) = 1,oneobtains ¬Ø¬µ(P)‚â•0. Furthermorenotethat,\nwhen using Œ£ ={(1,2),(2,1),(1,1)}, one has Lk‚â§ |Œ±|\nand/summationtext\nkLk‚â§N. This together with S(n,m)‚â§1implies\nthe property ¬Ø¬µ(P)‚â§(N‚àí |Œ±|)/N. Intuitively, the value\n¬Ø¬µ(P)expresses the average score or precision of the given\npathfamily P.\nNext,wedeÔ¨Ånesomekindof coverage orrecallmeasure\nforP. Tothisend,let Œ≥(P) :=‚à™k‚àà[1:K]œÄ1\nk‚äÜ[1 :N]bethe\nunion of all segments deÔ¨Åned by the Ô¨Årst projection of the\npathsœÄk. Then we deÔ¨Ånethe normalizedcoverage ¬ØŒ≥(P)of\nPby\n¬ØŒ≥(P) :=|Œ≥(P)|‚àí|Œ±|\nN. (7)Asabove,thelength |Œ±|issubtractedtocompensatefortriv-\nial coverage.

(8)\nIn other words, the Ô¨Åtness integrates the normalized score\nand coverageinto one measure. Finally, the Ô¨Åtnessœï(Œ±)of\na segment Œ±is deÔ¨Åned to be the Ô¨Åtness value of the score-\nmaximizingpathfamily P‚àódeÔ¨Ånedin(4):\nœï(Œ±) :=œï(P‚àó). (9)\nNote that the path family P‚àódeÔ¨Ånes in a natural way a set\nof disjoint segments revealing the repetitions of Œ±within\nthe sequence X, see Figure 1. An optimal path family P‚àó\nfor a segment Œ±can be computed efÔ¨Åciently with O(|Œ±| √ó\nN)operations using dynamic programming. Actually, the\nalgorithm, which we do not describe in this paper due to\nspace limitations, is an extension of classical dynamic tim e\nwarping(DTW),see [4, 6].\nWhen computing the Ô¨Åtness œï(Œ±)for all possible seg-\nmentsŒ±= [s:t]‚äÜ[1 :N], one can obtain a com-\npact Ô¨Åtness representation for the entire music recording.\nMore precisely, we arrange all Ô¨Åtness values in some time-\nlag Ô¨Åtness matrix Œ¶‚ààRN√óNdeÔ¨Åned by Œ¶(s,‚Ñì) :=œï([s:\ns+‚Ñì‚àí1])forthestartingpoint s‚àà[1 :N]andthesegment\nlength‚Ñì‚àà[1 :N‚àís+ 1], whereas all other entries of Œ¶\naresettozero,seeFigure3cforanexample. Notethateach\ncell(s,‚Ñì)of the Ô¨Åtness matrix Œ¶deÔ¨Ånes an optimal path\nfamily for the segment Œ±= [s:s+‚Ñì‚àí1].

The main challenge is\nthat the songs are performed by elderly non-professional\nsingers with serious intonation problems, large tempo\nchanges, and interruptions‚Äînot to speak of poor record-\ning conditions and background noise. In [8], a reference-\nbased segmentation algorithm, which reverts to an addi-\ntional MIDI Ô¨Åle used as stanza reference, is described and\ntestedfor 47ofthesesongs.

To\nthis end, we determine the Ô¨Åtness-maximizing segment Œ±‚àó\nas in (10) and derive the segmentation from the associ-\nated path family. Using the same evaluation measures as\nin [8],ourreference-freemethodyieldsanF-measurevalue\nofF = 0.821, see Table 1. Assuming some prior knowl-\nedge on the minimal length of a stanza, this result can\nbe improved. For example, using the lower bound Œª=\n10 seconds oneobtains F = 0.855,see Table 1. This result\nis still worse than the results obtained from the reference-\nbased approach ( F = 0.926). Actually, a manual inspec-\ntion showed that this degrade was mainly caused by four\nparticular recordings, where the segmentationderived fro m\nŒ±‚àówas ‚Äúphase-shifted‚Äù comparedto the groundtruth.

Further-\nmore, we found out that these phase shifts were caused by\nthe fact that in all of these four recordings the singer com-\npletely failed in the Ô¨Årst stanza (omittingand confusingen -\ntire verse lines). In a Ô¨Ånal experiment,we replacedthe four\nrecordings by a slightly shortened version by omitting the\nÔ¨Årst stanzas, respectively.

INTRODUCTION\nMixed music analysis (estimating the pitch and instrument\nlabels of each musical note from a single-channel polyphonic\nmusic signal with multiple instruments) has been recognized\nas one of the most challenging tasks in musical signal pro-\ncessing. To achieve this, many approaches have been pro-\nposed so far: ICA-based methods [1, 3], HTTC (Harmonic-\nTemporal-Timbral Clustering) [6], Instrogram [5], etc. Of\nall these techniques, the methods based on NMF (Non-negative\nMatrix Factorization) have attracted considerable attention\nlately as a way to analyze signals more effectively and more\neasily. In many of these techniques, an observed spectro-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.gram matrix can be represented as a linear combination of\ntwo matrices: a basis matrix whose columns roughly indi-\ncate spectrums of each musical source with various pitches\nand instruments, and an activity matrix which shows tempo-\nral information of each basis vector.\nNMF-based analysis methods are broadly divided into\ntwo categories: an unsupervised approach [4] and a super-\nvised approach [2]. Since the former approach decomposes\nthe spectrogram without the assumption of the spectral struc-\ntures of audio sources, the unintended basis matrix and ac-\ntivity matrix will be obtained. Therefore, it is hard to an-\nalyze mixed-source audio correctly using an unsupervised\napproach.\nOn the other hand, a supervised approach decomposes a\nmixed musical signal using the spectral templates of each\nmusical source, which are learned beforehand. Compared\nto an unsupervised approach, this technique tends to pro-\nduce preferable results in terms of analysis speed and ac-\ncuracy. However, if unlearned sounds are contained in the\ntest signal, the accuracy may deteriorate because there are\nmany different types (models) of instrument that belong to\nthe same instrumental category. For example, the ‚ÄúPiano‚Äù\ncategory includes different models: ‚ÄúPiano1‚Äù,‚ÄúPiano2‚Äù, and\nso on. To improve the decomposition accuracy, many kinds\nof spectral templates (not only different categories but dif-\nferent models in the categories) should be trained. However,\nthis is extremely difÔ¨Åcult to build into a real system.\nTo solve this problem, we propose a novel method of\nmixed music analysis, which uses a model-invariant fea-\nture (probabilistic spectrum envelope; PSE) of each cate-\ngory. This feature is derived from the following idea. An\ninstrument‚Äôs spectrum can differ slightly due to various fac-\ntors associated not only with the type of instrument (model)\nbut also the manufacturer, the materials used, the tempera-\nture, humidity, and playing-style, etc. However, the way the\nspectrum Ô¨Çuctuates is not completely random, as it depends\non the instrument‚Äôs category. Therefore, we introduce the\nPSE feature that does not depend on the pitch, the model,\nthe material, and other various factors. This is similar to a\nspectrum envelope feature, which does not depend on the\npitch. The feature is deÔ¨Åned as a set of the mean spec-\n181Poster Session 2\ntrum envelope and variance spectrum envelope in the time-\nfrequency domain as shown in Figure 1 (a). Once the PSE\nis estimated, any spectrum belonging to the category can be\nobtained by multiplying various comb Ô¨Ålters and randomly-\ngenerated spectrum envelopes from the PSE.\nFigure 1 shows a system Ô¨Çowchart of mixed music anal-\nysis under the PSE framework.

PSE ESTIMATION\n2.1 Spectral peaks extraction\nThe probabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE) of each category\nis estimated by SPGP+HS regression [7] in this paper. In\nthis section, we will discuss the way spectral peaks (input\nsamples used for the regression) are obtained.\nFirst, we prepare some acoustic signals, each of which\ncontains only the needed musical sources of the instrumen-\ntal category. The various sources do not sound at the same\ntime. In this paper, 12 half-tone sources sound in sequence\nevery octave. Employing NMF to the amplitude spectro-\ngramV(‚ààRF√óT)of the signal, Vis approximately de-\ncomposed into the product of a basis matrix W(‚ààRF√óR)\nand an activity matrix H(‚ààRR√óT)as follows:\nV‚âàWH (1)\n‚àÄi, j, k,Wij‚â•0,Hjk‚â•0 (2)\nwhere F, T andRare the numbers of bins of frequency, time\nand bases, respectively (here, R= 12 ).\nWandHcan be obtained by iteratively calculating up-\ndate rules based on Euclidean divergence. The update rulesfor each matrix element are:\nWij‚ÜêWij(VHT)ij\n(WHHT)ij(3)\nHjk‚ÜêHjk(WTV)jk\n(WTWH)jk. (4)\nFrom the updated matrix W, a set of Nspectral peaks\nP= (f,y)={(fn, yn)}nare exploited, where fnandyn\nare frequency and amplitude of the n-th peak, respectively.\nThese peaks are found by searching for the harmonic peaks\nof each basis vector.\n2.2 PSE estimation using SPGP+HS\nIn this paper, the PSE of each category can be estimated\nby extended Gaussian Process (SPGP+HS [7]), which can\napproximate the shape of any function with varying variance\nmore accurately than the standard Gaussian Process.\nBy giving a set of peaks, P, to one-dimensional SPGP+HS,\nwe obtain PSE mean envelope ¬µfand PSE variance enve-\nlopeœÉf, as follows:\n¬µf=KffmQK fmfnŒõ‚àí1y (5)\nœÉf=Kff‚àíKffm(K‚àí1\nfmfm‚àíQ)KT\nffm (6)\nwhere,Q=(\nKfmfm+KfmfnŒõ‚àí1KT\nfmfn)‚àí1\nandŒõ=\ndiag(Kfnfn‚àíKT\nfmfnK‚àí1\nfmfmKfmfn).Kabis a gram ma-\ntrix between aandbwith a parameter Œ∏.

Œ®(f;f0)is a comb\nÔ¨Ålter with a fundamental frequency f0, calculated as:\nŒ®(f;f0) =‚àë\nlexp{\n‚àí(f‚àíf0¬∑l)2\n2ŒΩ2}\n(9)\n18212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwhere lis the index of Gaussian components, and ŒΩis a\nhyper-parameter to determine the kurtosis of each compo-\nnent.\nUsing the above procedure, we can obtain an intended\nbasis matrix ÀúWwhose columns (spectrums) are randomly\ngenerated for various categories and fundamental frequen-\ncies.\n3.2 Basis matrix optimization using Genetic Algorithm\nWhat we want to do in the analysis stage is to Ô¨Ånd the op-\ntimum NMF matrices ÀÜWandÀÜHfor a given test signal. To\ndo this, we introduce an optimization method based on ge-\nnetic algorithm (GA), which is a method for Ô¨Ånding the op-\ntimum by repeating natural-evolution-inspired techniques:\nselection, crossover, mutation and inheritance.\nGiven an amplitude spectrogram Xof a test signal and\na randomly-generated basis matrix ÀúW, the activity matrix\nHcan be calculated by applying supervised NMF with ÀúW.\nThat is, each element of His repeatedly updated by Eq. (4)\nwhile keeping ÀúWÔ¨Åxed. Since ÀúWdetermines Hin this cal-\nculation, Hcan be considered as a function of ÀúW. IfÀúWhas\nbetter (more suited) spectral columns for the test signal, the\ndistance between XandÀúWH must become smaller. There-\nfore, the minimization of Euclidean distance DEUC(X,ÀúWH)\ncan be used as a criterion for Ô¨Ånding the candidate ÀúW. In\naddition to the distance criterion, we give two constraints\nsp(H)andden(H). The former sp(H)leads the matrix H\nto be sparse, which is\nsp(H) =#{(j, k)|Hjk‚â§/epsilon1}\nR√óT(10)\nwhere, /epsilon1(‚â•0)is a small value (in our experiments, /epsilon1= 0.1).\nThe other constraint den(H)represents the ‚Äúdensity‚Äù of\nthe elements in H. This idea is inspired by the fact that\nmusical notes of each instrument tend to group together in\nregard to time and tone. We deÔ¨Åne the constraint den(H)\nas:\nden(H) =‚àë\nk,l,l/primeexp{\n‚àí(sk,l‚àísk+1,l/prime)2\n2œÅ2}\n‚àë\nkNk(11)\n{sk,l}Nk\nl=1={j|Hjk‚â•/epsilon1} (12)\nwhere œÅis a constant factor for determing the allowance for\ndistant tones (in our test, œÅ= 3).\nFinally, we set the criteria for the optimum search of the\ncandidate ÀúWas follows:\nŒò(ÀúW) =DEUC(X,ÀúWH)‚àíŒ±¬∑sp(H)‚àíŒ≤¬∑den(H)(13)\nwhere, Œ±(‚â•0)andŒ≤(‚â•0)are weight parameters that\nreÔ¨Çect the effects of sparseness and density constraints, re-\nspectively.In our analysis method, the optimum basis matrix ÀÜW\nis obtained using GA to minimize the objective function\n(13). The Ô¨Årst step of GA is to generate U(= 12 , in our\ntests) basis matrices {ÀúWu}U\nu=1from pre-trained PSEs (See\n3.1.), and evaluate the objective function for each matrix by\nEq. (13). Note that fundamental frequency of each column\nin the u-th basis matrix ÀúWuis different from the others, but\nthe fundamental frequency of the l-th column for all basis\nmatrices has the same fundamental frequency. To update\nthe whole set, the following process is repeated G(= 100 ,\nin this paper) times:\n1. Copy the best (smallest-objective) basis matrix of the\nprevious generation to the current generation.\n2. With a probability pcross , exchange two selected basis\nmatrices according to the uniform crossover.\n3. With a probability pmut, mutate a selected basis ma-\ntrix based on PSE.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until the number of basis matrices\nof the current generation reaches L.\nConcerning the expression ‚Äúselect‚Äù above, the probability\nofu-th candidate selection is deÔ¨Åned asŒò(ÀúWu,ÀúHu)PU\nu=1Œò(ÀúWu,ÀúHu).\nThis shows that the better ÀúWutends to be selected more.\npcross andpmutin steps 2 and 3 are respectively the prob-\nabilities of crossover and mutation, which satisfy pcross +\npmut= 1 (in this paper, pcross = 0.9, pmut= 0.1). Fur-\nthermore, our GA has the constraints that each basis matrix\nmutates without altering the fundamental frequencies. In\nother words, the mutated new vector is calculated by multi-\nplying the randomly-generated spectrum envelope from PSE\nby the comb Ô¨Ålter that has the same fundamental frequency\nas the original one. Therefore, basis matrices of each gener-\nation can be generated without changing the information on\nthe fundamental frequency and category we set at Ô¨Årst.\nThe Ô¨Ånal analysis result is the optimum NMF matrices\nÀÜWandÀÜH, which are the best matrices in G-th generation\n(ÀÜHis obtained by supervised NMF with the optimum basis\nmatrix ÀÜW). Because ÀÜWcontains a category index c, a test\nsignal can be decomposed into each instrument.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\nTo evaluate our proposed method, ‚Äúwav-to-mid‚Äù tests were\nconducted. In these experiments, an acoustic data synthe-\nsized with MIDI sounds is automatically converted into MIDI\nformat. A part of ‚ÄúRWC-MDB-C-2001 No. 43: Sicilienne\nop.78‚Äù from RWC Music Database1was used for the test\n(Figure 3 (a)). The monaural test signal was recorded at a\n16kHz sampling rate using multiple MIDI instruments: Pi-\nano and Flute (exactly, ‚ÄúPiano1‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlute1‚Äù instrumental\n1http://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/\n183Poster Session 2\nmodels of MIDI, respectively). Before the test, PSEs for the\ntwo categories were trained using the different sounds from\nthe test signal (‚ÄúPiano2‚Äù for ‚ÄúPiano‚Äù PSE and ‚ÄúFlute2‚Äù for\n‚ÄúFlute‚Äù PSE). Using the PSEs, GA found the optimum ma-\ntrices ÀÜWandÀÜH. By binarizing ÀÜHwith an adequate thresh-\nold, we obtained the Ô¨Ånal results of MIDI format. The re-\nsults were compared for the cases in which the objective\nfunction of GA has sparseness and density constraints and\nwhen it does not (‚Äúsp+den‚Äù, ‚Äúsp‚Äù,‚Äúden‚Äù,‚Äúw/o‚Äù). Since the\nresults depend on the initial values of {ÀúWu}U\nu=1, we re-\npeated each method by 100times and computed the mean,\nmaximum, and minimum values of accuracy. We also com-\npared the results with the conventional method, supervised\nNMF (‚Äús-NMF‚Äù given the basis matrix of ‚ÄúPiano2‚Äù, ‚Äúideal‚Äù\ngiven that of ‚ÄúPiano1‚Äù).\nFigure 2 illustrates MIDI-conversion accuracies for each\nmethod. The accuracy is calculated asNall‚àí(Nins+Ndel)\nNall√ó\n100, where Nall, NinsandNdelmean the total number of\nnotes, insertion errors, and deletion errors, respectively. Be-\ncause onset time and the duration of each sound source are\nnot necessarily correct in the above binarizing process, we\npermitted the duration to differ and the onset time to shift\nœÑseconds (in this paper, œÑ= 0.3). The bar values of our\nmethods in the Ô¨Ågure are average accuracies for 100tries,\nand the error bars indicate maximum and minimum values\nof the tries. Concerning the results of conventional meth-\nods, if the system knows exactly the same sounds as the test\nsignal, it yields high performance (ideal). However, if the\nsystem does not know, the accuracy deteriorates dramati-\ncally (s-NMF). Meanwhile, each of our approaches main-\ntains high accuracy even when the system does not learn\nthe sounds of the test data. The preferable results are due\nto the fact that each PSE can be estimated by only various\npitches, and it can cover spectrum envelopes of unknown\nmodels. Comparing within our approaches, the system with\nsparseness or density constraints achives better accuracy,\nand when both constraints were added (‚Äúsp+den‚Äù), for the\ntests with the best results, there were cases when the accu-\nracy even exceeded the ideal value.\nAn analysis example of ‚Äúsp+den‚Äù tries is shown in Fig-\nure 3 (b). Almost all the notes were estimated correctly,\nbut parts of them were mistaken as octave-different notes.\nTherefore, we will improve the accuracy by adding other\nconstraints to avoid octave differences in the future.\n020406080100sp+denspdenw/os-NMFidealAccuracy [%]\nFigure 2 .

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we proposed an algorithm for monaural sound\nsource decomposition and multiple-pitch estimation. The\nmethod categorizes several spectrum envelopes for each mu-\nsical category, inspired by invariance of spectral Ô¨Çuctuation\nin a category. This categorized envelope, called the prob-\nabilistic spectrum envelope (PSE), has a characteristic of\nbeing able to absorb differences between models, pitches,\nmanufactures, playing-style, and so on. PSE consists of a\nmean envelope and variance envelope which can be simul-\ntaneously estimated by SPGP+HS regression as described\nin this paper. In the analysis stage, Genetic Algorithm (GA)\nwith supervised-NMF-based objective and sparseness/density\nconstraints was employed for an optimum search in all the\nspectrum envelopes that can be generated from the PSE.\nThe simulation experiments using MIDI sources show\nthat the proposed method is robust to instrumental model\nchanges. Since the results depend on the initial values, how-\never, future research will include designing a directly opti-\nmum search method, such as ML (Maximum likelihood) or\nMAP (Maximum a posteriori) estimations.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic transcription is the task of transcribing audio into a\nscore. It is a challenging problem because multiple notes\nare often played at once (polyphony), and thus individual\nnotes interfere by virtue of their harmonic relations.\nA number of methods have been proposed since Moorer\nÔ¨Årst attempted to use computers for automatic music tran-\nscription [10]. State-of-the-art methods can be categorized\ninto three approaches: iterative F0 searches, joint source es-\ntimation and classiÔ¨Åcation-based approaches. Iterative F0-\nsearching methods Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ånd the predominant F0 and subtract\nits relevant sources (e.g. harmonic partials) from the input\nsignal and then repeat the procedure on what remains until\nno additional F0s are found [6]. Joint source estimation ex-\namines possible combinations of sound sources by hypoth-\nesizing that the input signal is approximated by a weighted\nsum of the sound sources with different F0s [3].\nWhile these two methods are based on utilizing the struc-\nture of musical tones, classiÔ¨Åcation-based approaches ad-\ndress polyphonic transcription as a pattern-recognition prob-\nlem. The idea is to use multiple binary classiÔ¨Åers, each of\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.which corresponds to a note class. They are trained with\nshort-time acoustic features and labels for the corresponding\nnote class (i.e., note on/off) and then used to predict the note\nlabels for new input data. Although classiÔ¨Åcation-based ap-\nproaches make minimum use of knowledge of acoustics,\nthey show comparable results to iterative F0 searches and\njoint source estimation, particularly for piano music [9, 12].\nHowever, when the training set is limited or the piano in the\ntest set has different timbre, tuning or recording environ-\nments, classiÔ¨Åcation-based approaches can overÔ¨Åt the train-\ning data, a problem common to many supervised learning\ntasks [13]. As a means to obtain features robust to acoustic\nvariations, researchers have designed networks of adaptive\noscillators on auditory Ô¨Ålter banks or normalized spectro-\ngram on the frequency axis [9, 12].\nThe majority of machine learning tasks rely on these kinds\nof hand-engineered approaches to extract features. Recently,\non the other hand, unsupervised feature learning methods\nthat automatically capture the statistical relationship in data\nand learn feature representations have shown great promise.\nIn particular, deep belief networks have been successfully\napplied to many computer-vision and speech-recognition ta-\nsks as an alternative to typical feature-extraction methods,\nbut also a few music-related tasks [4, 8].\nIn this paper, we apply deep belief networks to poly-\nphonic piano transcription. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we extend a previ-\nous classiÔ¨Åcation-based approach in two ways: (1) by using\nlearned feature representations for note classiÔ¨Åers and (2) by\njointly training the classiÔ¨Åers for multiple notes. In particu-\nlar, the latter associates deep belief networks with multi-task\nlearning. The results show that our approach outperforms\ncompared music transcription methods for several test sets.\n2. FEATURE LEARNING\nDeep belief networks (DBNs) are constructed by stacking\nrestricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and training them\nin a greedy layer-wise manner. In this section, we brieÔ¨Çy\nreview RBMs and how to build a deep structure.\n2.1 Sparse Restricted Boltzmann Machines\nThe RBM is a two layer undirected graphical model that has\nhidden nodes hand visible nodes v[11]. The visible nodes\n175Poster Session 2\nrepresent the data while the hidden nodes represent the fea-\ntures discovered by training the RBM. For each possible as-\nsignment to the hidden and visible nodes, the RBM speci-\nÔ¨Åes the probability of the assignment (Eq. 1). The RBM has\nsymmetric connections between the two layers denoted by a\nweight matrix W, but no connections within hidden nodes\nor visible nodes. This particular conÔ¨Åguration makes it easy\nto compute the conditional probability distributions, when v\norhis Ô¨Åxed (Eq. 2). In practice, one uses this conditional\nprobability of the hidden nodes as the ‚Äúlearned‚Äù features:\n‚àílogP(v,h)‚àùE(v,h) =\n1\n2œÉ2vTv‚àí1\nœÉ2/parenleftbig\ncTv+bTh+hTWv/parenrightbig\n(1)\np(hj|v) =sigmoid (1\nœÉ2(bj+wT\njv)) (2)\nwhere œÉ2is a scaling parameter, bandcare learned bi-\nases, and Wis a learned weight matrix. This formulation\nmodels the visible nodes as real-valued Gaussian units and\nthe hidden nodes as binary units. We further regularize the\nmodel with sparsity by encouraging each hidden unit to have\na pre-determined expected activation using a regularization\npenalty [7].\n2.2 Deep Belief Network\nA deep network is composed of multiple non-linear hidden\nlayers (as opposed to a shallow network with a single hid-\nden layer). Each layer in a deep network builds upon rep-\nresentations discovered by the previous layer to represent\nmore complex features of the data. A DBN is trained by\n‚Äúgreedy layer-wise stacking‚Äù of RBMs. First, a single layer\nRBM is trained to model the data. This RBM learns a set of\nweights Wand biases b,cthat we Ô¨Åx as the parameters of\nthe Ô¨Årst layer of the DBN. To learn the next layer of weights\nand biases, we compute the features discovered by the Ô¨Årst\nlayer RBM (Eq. 2) and apply them to a binary-binary RBM\n(which has binary input units instead of Gaussian) to learn\nanother layer of representation; this forms the parameters\nfor our next layer of features. Deeper layers are learned in\na similar fashion. Hinton et al. showed that the preceding\nlearning algorithm for a DBN always improves a variational\nlower bound on the log-likelihood of the data when training\nmore layers [5].\nAfter training, the features learned from a DBN are ex-\ntracted using a feed-forward approximation for the proba-\nbilities of the hidden nodes at the deepest layer (i.e. cas-\ncades of sigmoids) given the visible nodes. These features\ncan be used for tasks such as classiÔ¨Åcation. In practice,\none often further reÔ¨Ånes the features learned by the DBN\nby treating the feature extraction process and classiÔ¨Åer as\na deep feed-forward neural network. The initialization of\nthe deep neural network using RBMs is often known as\nFigure 1 : Randomly selected feature bases learned from\nspectrograms of piano music. Most feature bases capture\nharmonic distributions which correspond to various pitches\nwhile a few contain non-harmonic patterns.\nunsupervised ‚Äúpre-training,‚Äù while supervised training with\nbackpropagation is often known as supervised ‚ÄúÔ¨Ånetuning.‚Äù\nThe pre-training/Ô¨Ånetuning approach for learning deep net-\nworks has been shown to be essential for training deep net-\nworks. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, training a deep network with only su-\npervised backpropagation from random initialization does\nnot work as well as pre-training.\n2.3 Application To Audio Spectrogram\nIn this paper, we apply DBNs to audio spectrograms. The\nDBNs are built in two stages. The Ô¨Årst stage performs un-\nsupervised learning with sparse RBMs up to two hidden\nlayers in order to Ô¨Ånd sparse hidden units that represent\nspectrogram frames. The second (optional) stage uses back-\npropagation to Ô¨Ånetune the representation so that note clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers have better discrimination power to correctly iden-\ntify note on and off events. Figure 1 displays features bases\n(column vectors of matrix W) learned from spectrograms of\nclassical piano music by a sparse RBM.\n3. CLASSIFICATION-BASED TRANSCRIPTION\nWe build our polyphonic piano-transcription model based\non Poliner and Ellis‚Äô frame-level note classiÔ¨Åcation system\n[12,13]. Furthermore, we extend their system by using DBN-\nbased feature representations and by jointly training classi-\nÔ¨Åers for multiple notes.\n3.1 Single-note Training\nPoliner and Ellis‚Äô piano transcription system consists of 87\nindependent support vector machine (SVM) classiÔ¨Åers, each\nof which predicts the presence of a corresponding piano\nnote when given an audio feature vector (a single column\n17612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n......InputMultiple-NoteTrainingLinear SVM(Baseline)Linear SVM+ Hidden Layers...Single-NoteTrainingOutput..................OutputInputHiddenLayers...Figure 2 : Network conÔ¨Ågurations for single-note and\nmultiple-note training. Features are obtained from feed-\nforward transformation as indicated by the bottom-up ar-\nrows. They can be Ô¨Ånetuned by back-propagation as indi-\ncated by the top-down arrows.\nof a normalized spectrogram). Their transcription system\nrequires individual supervised training for each note. Thus,\nwe refer to this as single-note training.\nWe constrained the SVM in our experiments to a lin-\near kernel because Poliner and Ellis reported that high-order\nkernels (e.g. RBF kernel) provided only modest performance\ngains with signiÔ¨Åcantly more computation [13] and also a\nlinear SVM is more suitable to large-scale data. We formed\nthe training data by selecting spectrogram frames that in-\nclude the note (positive examples) and those that do not in-\nclude it (negative examples). Poliner and Ellis randomly\nsampled 50 positive (when available) and negative exam-\nples from each piano song per note. We used their sampling\nparadigm for single-note training.\nWhile their system used a normalized spectrogram, we\nreplaced it with DBN-based feature representations on spec-\ntrogram frames. As shown in the left column of Figure 2, the\nprevious approach directly feeds spectrogram frames into\nSVM, whereas our approach transforms the spectrogram fra-\nmes into mid-level features via one or two layers of learned\nnetworks and then feeds them into the classiÔ¨Åer. We also\nÔ¨Ånetuned the networks with the error from the SVM.\n3.2 Multiple-note Training\nWhen we experimented with single-note training described\nabove, we observed that the classiÔ¨Åers are somewhat ‚Äúag-\ngressive‚Äù, that is, they produced even more ‚Äúfalse alarm‚Äù er-\nrors (detect inactive notes as active ones) than ‚Äúmiss‚Äù errors\n(fail to detect active notes). In particular, this signiÔ¨Åcantly\ndegraded onset accuracy. Also, it was substantially slow to\nÔ¨Ånetune the DBN networks separately for each note. Thus,\nwe suggest a way of training multiple binary classiÔ¨Åers atthe same time. We refer to this as multiple-note training.\nThe idea is to sum 88 SVM objectives and train them\nwith shared audio features and 88 binary labels (at a given\ntime, a single audio feature has 88 corresponding binary la-\nbels), as if we train a single classiÔ¨Åer.1This allows cross-\nvalidation to be jointly performed for 88 SVMs, thereby sav-\ning a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of training time. On the other hand,\nthis requires a different way of sampling examples. Since\nwe combined all 88 notes in our experiments, all spectro-\ngram frames except silent ones are a positive example to at\nleast one SVM. Thus we sampled training data by selecting\nspectrogram frames at every K frame time. K was set to\n16 as a trade-off between data reduction and performance.\nNote that this makes the ratio of positive and negative exam-\nples for each SVM determined by occurrences of the note\nin the whole training set, thereby having signiÔ¨Åcantly more\nnegative examples than positive ones for most SVMs. It\nturned out that this ‚Äúunbalanced‚Äù data ratio makes the clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers ‚Äúless aggressive,‚Äù as a result, increasing overall per-\nformance.\nWe illustrate multiple-note training in the right column\nof Figure 2. In fact, without Ô¨Ånetuning the DBNs, multiple-\nnote training is equivalent to single-note training with the\nunbalanced data ratio. The only difference is that the single-\nnote training does separate cross-validation for each SVM.\nWe compared multiple-note training to the single-note train-\ning with the unbalanced data ratio, but found no noticeable\ndifference in performance. On the other hand, when we\nÔ¨Ånetune the DBNs, these two training approaches become\ncompletely different. While single-note training produces\nseparate DBN parameters for each note, multiple-note train-\ning allows the networks to shares the parameters among all\nnotes by updating them with the errors from the combined\nSVMs. For example, when the multiple-note training looks\nat the presence of a C3 note given input features, it simulta-\nneously checks out if other notes (e.g. C4 or C5) are played.\nThis can be seen as an example of multi-task learning.\n3.3 HMM Post-processing\nThe frame-level classiÔ¨Åcation described above treats train-\ning examples independently without considering dependency\nbetween frames. Poliner and Ellis used HMM-based post-\nprocessing to temporally smooth the SVM prediction. They\nmodeled each note independently with a two-state HMM.\nWe also adopted this approach. In our implementation, how-\never, we converted the SVM output (distance to the bound-\nary) to a posterior probability using\np(yi= 1|xi) =sigmoid (Œ±(Œ∏Txi)), (3)\n1The classiÔ¨Åer we used is a linear SVM with a L2-regularized L2-\nloss [2]. We implemented the SVM in MATLAB using minFunc, which\nis a Matlab library found in http://www.cs.ubc.ca/‚àºschmidtm/\nSoftware/minFunc.html . Thus, summing 88 SVM objectives was\ndone by simply treating 88 binary labels as a vector.\n177Poster Session 2\nInput (Spectrogram )Hidden layer activation  HMM outputSVM output\nTime (10ms)Frequency [kHz]10020030040000.511.5\nTime (10ms)Hidden unit index10020030040050100150200250\nTime (10ms)MIDI note number100200300400406080100\nTime (10ms)MIDI note number100200300400406080100Figure 3 : Signal transformation through the DBNs and classiÔ¨Åcation stages\nwhere xiis a SVM input vector, Œ∏are SVM parameters, yi\nis a label and Œ±is a scaling constant.

EVALUATION\n4.1 Datasets\nWe used three datasets to evaluate our method.\nPoliner and Ellis set consists of 124 MIDI Ô¨Åles of clas-\nsical piano music. They were rendered into 124 synthetic\npiano sound and 29 real piano recordings [12]. The Ô¨Årst\n60-second excerpt of each song was used.\nMAPS is a large piano dataset that includes various pat-\nterns of playing and pieces of music [1]. We used 9 sets of\npiano pieces, each with 30 songs. They were created by var-\nious high-quality software synthesizers (7 sets) and Yamaha\nDisklavier (2 sets). We used the Ô¨Årst 30-second excerpt of\neach song in the validation and test sets but the same length\nat a random position for the training set.\nMarolt set consists of 3 synthetic piano and 3 real piano\nrecordings [9]. This set was used only for test.\n4.2 Pre-processing\nWe Ô¨Årst computed spectrogram from the datasets with a 128-\nms window and 10ms overlaps. To remove note dynamics,\nwe normalized each column by dividing entries with their\nsum, and then compressed it using cube root, commonly\nused as an approximation to the loudness sensitivity of hu-\nman ears. Furthermore, we applied PCA whitening to the\nnormalized spectrogram, retaining 99% of the training data\nvariance and adding 0.01 to the variance before the whiten-\ning. This yielded roughly 50-60% dimensionality reduction\nand lowpass Ô¨Åltering in the PCA domain. The ground truth\nwas created from the MIDI Ô¨Åles. We extended note offset\ntimes by 100ms in all training data to make up for room ef-\nfect in the piano recordings. The extended note length wasexperimentally determined.\n4.3 Unsupervised Feature Learning\nWe trained the Ô¨Årst and second-layer DBN representations\nusing the pre-processed spectrogram. The hidden layer size\nwas chosen to 256 and the expected activation of hidden\nunits(sparsity) was cross-validated over 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and\n0.3, while other parameters were kept Ô¨Åxed.\n4.4 Evaluation Metrics\nWe primarily used the following metric of accuracy:\nAccuracy =TP\nFP+FN+TP, (4)\nwhere TP (true positive) is the number of correctly predicted\nexamples, FP (false positives) is the number of note-off ex-\namples transcribed as note-on, FN (false negative) is the\nnumber of note-on examples transcribed as note-off. This\nmetric is used for both frame-level and onset accuracy. Frame-\nlevel accuracy is measured by counting the correctness of\nframes every 10ms, and onset accuracy is by searching a\nnote onset of the correct pitch within 100 ms of the ground-\ntruth onset. In addition, we used the F-measure for frame-\nlevel accuracy to compare our results to those published us-\ning the metric.\n4.5 Training Scenarios\nOur method is evaluated in two different scenarios. In the\nÔ¨Årst scenario, we mainly used the Poliner and Ellis set, split-\nting it into training, validation and test data following [12].\nIn order to avoid overÔ¨Åtting to the speciÔ¨Åc piano set, we se-\nlected 26 songs from two synthesizer pianos sets in MAPS\nand used them as an additional validation set. For conve-\nnience, we refer to this subset as MAPS 2. In the second\nscenario, we used Ô¨Åve remaining synthesizer piano sets in\nMAPS for training to examine if our method generalizes\nwell when trained on diverse types of timbre and record-\ning conditions. For validation, we randomly took out 26\nsongs from the Ô¨Åve piano sets, calling them MAPS 5to dis-\ntinguish it from the actual training data. We additionally\nused MAPS 2for validation in the second scenario as well.2\n2The lists of MAPS songs for training, validation and test are speciÔ¨Åed\ninhttp://ccrma.stanford.edu/‚àºjuhan/ismir2011.html\n17812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n405060708090Accuracy (%)\nSingle‚àínote training Multiple‚àínote trainingPoliner Ellis\nMAPS2Poliner Ellis\nMAPS2\n  \nBaseline\nL1\nL1‚àífinetuned\nL2\nL2‚àífinetuned(a) Scenario 1\n405060708090Accuracy (%)\nSingle‚àínote training Multiple‚àínote trainingMAPS5MAPS2MAPS5MAPS2 (b) Scenario 2\nFigure 4 : Frame-level accuracy on validation sets in two scenarios.

The results are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.\nIn scenario 1, DBN features generally outperform the\nbaseline. In single-note training, Ô¨Ånetuned L1-features give\nthe highest accuracy on both validation sets. In multiple-\nnote training, unsupervised L1- or L2-features achieve slight-\nly better results. In comparison of the two training methods,\neither one appears to be not superior to the other, showing\nsubtle differences: Multiple-note training gives slightly bet-\nter results when the same piano set are used for validation\n(Poliner and Ellis), whereas single-note training does a little\nbetter job when different pianos set (MAPS 2) are used.\nIn scenario 2, the results show that DBN L1-features al-\nways achieve better results than the baseline but DBN L2-\nfeatures generally give worse accuracy. Finetuning always\nimproves results on both validation sets, although the incre-\nment is very limited on MAPS 2in multiple-note training.\nIn comparison of the two training methods, multiple-note\ntraining outperforms single-note training for both validation\nsets, particularly giving the best accuracy on MAPS 2. The\nsuperiority of multiple-note training is even more apparent\nin onset accuracy as shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows the inÔ¨Çuence of sparsity (hidden layer ac-\ntivation in RBMs) on frame-level accuracy. The accuracy\nis the average value on two validation sets (MAPS 5and\nMAPS 2) when L1 features are used in multiple-note train-\ning and scenario 2.

Thus, we chose\nDBN L1-features and multiple-training to run our system\non test sets. Also, we evaluated both unsupervised and Ô¨Åne-\ntuned features.\nTable 1 shows results on the Poliner and Ellis test set, and\nMarolt set. We divided the table into two groups to make a\nfair comparison. The upper group uses the same dataset for\nboth training and testing (the Poliner and Ellis set) whereas\nthe lower group assumes that the piano tones in the test sets\nwere ‚Äúunheard‚Äù in training or uses different transcription al-\ngorithms. In the upper group, Poliner and Ellis‚Äô transcrip-\ntion system adopted a normalized spectrogram and a non-\nlinear SVM. Our method outperformed their approach for\nboth test sets. In the lower group, our method trained with\nMAPS (scenario 2) also produced better accuracy than the\ntwo published results on both sets. Note that, in both groups,\nunsupervised features give better results than Ô¨Ånetuned fea-\ntures when different piano sets are used for training and test-\ning. As for onset accurary, we achieved 62 %in training sce-\nnario 1 on the Poliner and Ellis test set, which is very close\nto the Poliner and Ellis‚Äô result (62.3 %).\nTable 2 compares our method with other algorithms eval-\nuated on the MAPS test set, composed of 50 songs selected\nfrom the two Disklavier piano sets by [15].

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have applied DBNs to classiÔ¨Åcation-based polyphonic\npiano transcription. The results show that a learned feature\nrepresentation by a DBN, particularly L1 features, provide\nbetter transcription performance than the baseline features\nand our classiÔ¨Åcation approach outperforms compared pi-\nano transcription methods.\nOur evaluation shows that Ô¨Ånetuning generally improves\naccuracy, particularly when sparse features are used. How-\never, unsupervised features often work better when the sys-\ntem is tested on different piano sets. This indicates that un-\nsupervised features are more robust to acoustic variations.\nWe also suggested multiple-note training. Compared to\nsingle-note training, this method improved not only tran-\nscription accuracy but also training speed. In our comput-\ning environment, multiple-note training was more than Ô¨Åve\ntimes faster than single-note training when the DBNs are\nÔ¨Ånetuned.\nOur method is based on frame-level feature learning and\nbinary classiÔ¨Åcation under simple two-state note event mod-\neling. We think that more reÔ¨Ånements will be possible by\nmodeling richer states to represent dynamic properties of\nmusical notes.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] V . Emiya, R. Badeau and B.

INTRODUCTION\nThere is a long history of mechanical devices that generate\nacoustic sounds without direct human interaction starting\nfrom mechanical birds in antiquity to sophisticated player\npianos in the early 19th century that could perform arbi-\ntrary scores written in piano roll notation. Using computers\nto control such devices has opened up new possibilities in\nterms of Ô¨Çexibility and control while retaining the richness\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.of the acoustic sound associated with actual musical instru-\nments. The terms music robots or music robotic instruments\nhave been used to describe such devices [6].\nWe believe these new robotic instruments have a legiti-\nmate place with potential to become part of an embedded\nconventional musical practice, not just a research curios-\nity. While musical-robotics might seem niche and esoteric\nat this point [2], historic innovations such as monophonic\nto polyphonic music, electrical ampliÔ¨Åcation of the guitar,\nor computers in the recording studio all brought skepticism,\nbut eventually became mainstay practices.\nAlthough such music robots have been used in perfor-\nmance of both composed and improvised music as well as\nwith or without human performers sharing the stage, they\nare essentially passive output devices that receive control\nmessages and in response actuate sound producing mecha-\nnisms. Their control is typically handled by software written\nspeciÔ¨Åcally for each piece by the composer/performer.\nMusicians through training acquire a body of musical\nconcepts commonly known as musicianship. Machine mu-\nsicianship [9] refers to the technology of implementing mu-\nsical process such as segmentation, pattern processing and\ninteractive improvisation in computer programs. The ma-\njority of existing work in this area has focused on sym-\nbolic digital representations of music, typically MIDI. The\ngrowing research body of music information retrieval, espe-\ncially audio-based, can provide the necessary audio signal\nprocessing and machine learning techniques to develop ma-\nchine musicianship involving audio signals.\nThe typical architecture of interactive music robots is that\nthe control software receives symbolic messages based on\nwhat the other performers (robotic or human) are playing\nas well as messages from some kind of score for the piece.\nIt then sends control messages to the robot in order to trig-\nger the actuators generating the acoustic sound. In some\ncases the audio output of the other performers is automat-\nically analyzed to generate control messages. For example\naudio beat tracking can be used to adapt to the tempo played.\nSelf listening is a critical part of musicianship as any-\none who has struggled to play music on a stage without a\n567Poster Session 4\nFigure 1 .

One could\nremove the acoustic drum actuated by a solenoid so that no\nsound would be produced and the robotic percussionist will\ncontinue ‚Äúblissfully‚Äù playing along.\nThis work has been motivated by practical problems ex-\nperienced in a variety of performances involving percussive\nrobotic instruments. Figure 1 shows our experimental setup\nin which solenoid actuators supplied by Karmetik LLC.1\nare used to excite different types of frame drums.\nWe show how the ability of a robot to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù especially\nto its own acoustic audio output is critical in addressing\nthese problems and describe how we have adapted relevant\nmusic information retrieval techniques for this purpose. More\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, we describe how self-listening can be used to\nautomatically map controls to actuators as well as how it can\nbe used to provide self-adapting velocity response curves.\nFinally, we show how pitch extraction and dynamic time\nwarping can be used for high-level gesture analysis in both\nsensor and acoustic domains.\n2. RELATED WORK\nAn early example of an automated, programmable musi-\ncal instrument ensemble was described by al-Jazari (1136-\n1206) a Kurdish scholar, inventor, artist, mathematician that\nlived during the Islamic Golden Age (the Middle Ages in the\nwest). Best known for writing the Book of Knowledge of\nIngenious Mechanical Devices in 1206, his automata were\ndescribed as fountains on a boat featuring four automatic\n1http://karmetik.commusicians that Ô¨Çoated on a lake to entertain guests at royal\ndrinking parties. It had a programmable drum machine with\npegs (cams) that bumped into little levers that operated the\npercussion. The drummer could be made to play different\nrhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved\naround, performing more than Ô¨Åfty facial and body actions\nduring each musical selection. This was achieved through\nthe innovative use of hydraulic switching. A modern exam-\nple of a robotic musical ensemble is guitarist Pat Metheny‚Äôs\nOrchestrion which was speciÔ¨Åcally inÔ¨Çuenced by the Player\nPiano2. Metheny cites his grandfather‚Äôs player piano as\nbeing the catalyst to his interest in Orchestrions, which is a\nmachine that plays music and is designed to sound like an\norchestra or band.\nA seminal book in this Ô¨Åeld is ‚ÄúMachine Musicianship‚Äù\n[9], in which one of the sections describes a comprehensive\nsystem for the composition, creation and performance be-\ntween humans and robots. Rowe describes improvisational\nand composition systems that combine features of music\nfeature extraction, musical analysis and interactivity to gen-\nerate engaging experiences for the audience. In our work,\nthe integration of machine musicianship and music robotics\nhas been used to develop a robotic percussionist that can\nimprovise with a human performer playing a sitar enhanced\nwith digital sensors [7].\nAnother work closely related to ours is the Shimon human-\nrobot based Jazz improvisation system [3] that uses a ges-\nture based framework that recognizes that musicianship in-\nvolves not just the production of notes, but also of the in-\ntentional and consequential communication between musi-\ncians [4].\nOur system also uses these same basic building blocks,\nbut adds the power of machine learning and ‚Äúpropriocep-\ntion‚Äù to the process, enabling the robot itself to perform\nmany of the time consuming mapping and calibration pro-\ncesses that are often performed by hand in performance situ-\nations. In this context, a mapping refers to the process of de-\ntermining which controller output activates which solenoid.\nIn the next section we describe how some practical recurring\nproblems we have experienced with robots in music perfor-\nmance robots have led to the development of signal process-\ning and machine learning techniques informed by music in-\nformation retrieval ideas.\n3. MOTIV ATION\nOur team has extensive experience designing music robotic\ninstruments, implementing control and mapping strategies,\nand using them in live and interactive performances with\nhuman musicians, frequently in an improvisatory context.\nIn addition two of the co-authors are professional musicians\nwho have regularly performed with robotic instruments. One\n2http://www.patmetheny.com/orchestrioninfo/\n56812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nof the most important precursors to any musical performance\nis the sound check/rehearsal that takes place before a con-\ncert in a particular venue. During this time the musicians\nsetup their instruments, adjust the sound levels of each in-\nstrument and negotiate information speciÔ¨Åc to the perfor-\nmance such as positioning, sequencing and cues. A sim-\nilar activity takes place in performance involving robotic\nacoustic instruments in which the robots are set up, their\nacoustic output is calibrated and adjusted to the particular\nvenue and mappings between controls and gestures are es-\ntablished. This process is frequently tedious and typically\nrequires extensive manual intervention. To some extent this\npaper can be viewed as an attempt to utilize techniques and\nideas from MIR to simplify and automate this process. This\nis in contrast to previous work in robotic musicianship that\nmostly deals with the actual performance. More speciÔ¨Åcally\nwe deal with three problems: automatic mapping, velocity\ncalibration, and melodic and kinetic gesture recognition.\nThe experimental setup that we have used consists of a\nmodular robotic design in which multiple solenoid-based\nactuators can be attached to a variety of different drums.\nWe use audio signal processing and machine learning tech-\nniques to have robotic musical instruments that ‚Äùlisten‚Äù to\nthemselves using a single centrally located microphone.\nIt is a time consuming and challenging process to setup\nrobotic instruments in different venues. One issue is that\nof mapping, that is, which signal sent from the computer\nmaps to which robotic instrument. As the number of drums\ngrows, it becomes more challenging to manage the cables\nand connections between the controlling computer and the\nrobotic instruments. The system we propose performs tim-\nbre classiÔ¨Åcation of the incoming audio, automatically map-\nping solenoids correctly in real-time to the note messages\nsent to the musically desired drum. For example rather than\nsending an arbitrary control message to actuator 40 the con-\ntrol message is addressed to the bass drum and will be routed\nto the correct actuator by simply ‚Äúlistening‚Äù to what each\nactuator is playing in a sound-check stage. That way actua-\ntors can be moved or replaced easily even during the perfor-\nmance without changes in the control software. The same\napproach is also used to detect broken or malfunctioning\nactuators that do not produce sound.\nWhen working with mechanical instruments, there is a\ngreat deal of non-linearity and physical complexity that makes\nthe situation fundamentally different from working with elec-\ntronic sound, which is entirely ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù (or at least not phys-\nical) until it comes out of the speakers. The moving parts of\nthe actuators have momentum, and changes of direction are\nnot instantaneous. Gravity may also play a part, and there\nis friction to be overcome. Frequently actuators are on sep-\narate power supplies which can result in inconsistencies in\nthe voltage. The compositional process, rehearsal and per-\nformance of ‚ÄúThe Space Between Us‚Äù by by David A. Jaffe,in which Andrew Schloss was soloist on robotic percussion,\ninvolved hand-calibrating every note of the robotic chimes,\nxylophone and glockenspiel. This required 18+23+35 sep-\narate hand calibrations and took valuable rehearsal time. In\nthis paper we describe a method for velocity calibration, that\nis, what voltage should be sent to a solenoid to generate\na desired volume and timbre from an instrument. Due to\nthe mechanical properties of solenoids and drums, a small\nmovement in the relative position of these two can lead to a\nlarge change in sound output. The most dramatic of these is\nwhen during performance a drum moves out of place enough\nthat a voltage that at the start of the performance allowed the\ndrum to be hit now fails to make the drum sound. Depend-\ning on the musical context, this can be disastrous in a per-\nformance context. Good velocity scaling is essential for a\npercussion instrument to give a natural graduated response\nto subtle changes in gesture, e.g. a slight increase in the\nstrength (velocity) of a stroke should not result in a sudden\nincrease in the loudness of sound.\nIssues like velocity calibration or control mapping seem\nquite pedestrian, or even trivial until one has grappled with\nthis problem with real instruments. We believe that the abil-\nity of a robotic instrument to perceive at some level its own\nfunctioning is important in making robust, adaptive systems\nthat do not require regular human intervention to function\nproperly. We refer to this ability as ‚Äúproprioception‚Äù which\nin its original deÔ¨Ånition refers to the ability of an organism\nto perceive its own status.\nFinally we also describe some experiments recognizing\nmelodic and kinetic gestures at different tempi and with vari-\nations in how they are performed. This can be viewed as\nan exchange of cues established before the performance es-\npecially in an improvisatory context. This allows higher-\nlevel gestures to be used as cues without requiring exact re-\nproduction from the human performer interacting with the\nrobotic instrument and enables a more Ô¨Çuid and Ô¨Çexible struc-\nturing of performances.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Drum ClassiÔ¨Åcation for Automatic Mapping\nWe performed an experiment to investigate the performance\nof a audio feature extraction and machine learning system\nto classify drum sounds to perform automatic mapping. The\naudio features used were the well known Mel-Frequency\nCepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC) calculated with a window size\nof 22.3ms. These were then used as input to a Support Vec-\ntor Machine (SVM) machine learning system. We collected\na dataset of audio with 4 different frame drums being struck\nby the robot with a time of 128ms between strikes, then cal-\nculated all the MFCC of this audio, and then found the 8\nhighest MFCC0 (roughly corresponding to perceptual loud-\nness) and marked these as onsets in the audio. The MFCC\n569Poster Session 4\nPeak Percent Peak Percent\noffset correct offset correct\n0 66.38 4 90.52\n1 91.95 5 86.49\n2 91.67 6 86.49\n3 91.95 7 77.59\nTable 1 . ClassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy of an SVM classiÔ¨Åer The\nPeak offset is the offset from the time the drum is hit.\nfeature vectors corresponding to these onsets were used to\ntrain the classiÔ¨Åer. A separate test data set was also col-\nlected. Percussive sounds can be challenging to classify as\nthere is not a lot of steady state spectral information. The\nresults of this experiment gave a classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy of\n66.38%, as shown in the Ô¨Årst line (Peak offset 0) in Table 1.\nWe then performed the same experiment but using instead\ndifferent offsets from the highest peak in window sizes of\n22.3ms. When we classiÔ¨Åed all frames with the frame im-\nmediately after the highest peak, we obtained a classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion accuracy of 91.95%. We interpret this result to mean\nthat the resonance after the transient is clearly distinguish-\nable for different drums, whereas the transient at the onset is\nfairly similar for different drums. This performance quickly\ndegrades as we move away from the onset.\nThis performance quickly degrades as we move away\nfrom the onset. These results are for individual 22.3ms frames\nso it is easy to get 100% correct identiÔ¨Åcation by voting\nacross the entire recording which can then be used for the\nautomatic mapping. When we setup the robotic instrument\nwe actuate each solenoid in turn, classify the audio and then\nset the appropriate mappings so that the control software can\naddress the actual frame drums rather than the actuators.\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nCalibrated Input Velocity020406080100120140160Output Driving VelocityCalibration mapping\n1cm\n2cm\n3cm\nFigure 2 . Mapping from calibrated input velocities to out-\nput driving velocities for different distances4.2 Timbre-Adaptive Velocity Calibration\nThe acoustic response of a drum both in terms of perceived\nloudness and timbral quality is non-linear with respect to\nlinear increases in voltage as well as to the distance of the\nsolenoid to the vibrating surface. In the past calibration was\nperformed manually by listening to the output and adjust-\ning the mapping of input velocities to voltage until smooth\nchanges in loudness and timbre where heard. In this section\nwe describe how to derive an automatic data-driven map-\nping that is speciÔ¨Åc to the particular drum.\nOur Ô¨Årst objective is to achieve a linear increase in loud-\nness with increasing MIDI velocity for a given Ô¨Åxed dis-\ntance between beater and drumhead. However, in practice,\nthe beater may be mounted on a stand and placed next to the\ndrumhead mounted on a different stand. Thus the distance\nbetween beater and drumhead will vary depending on setup,\nand may even change during a performance. Thus a sec-\nond objective is to achieve a similar loudness versus MIDI\nvelocity (corresponding to voltage) curve over a range of\ndistances between beater and drumhead.\nTo achieve these objectives we collected audio for all\nvelocity values and three distance conÔ¨Åguration (near 1cm,\nmedium 2cm, far 3cm). The loudness and timbre variation\npossible is captured by computing MFCC for each strike.\nMore speciÔ¨Åcally for each velocity value and a particular\ndistance we obtain a vector of MFCC values. The frequency\nof beating was kept constant at 8 strikes per second for these\nmeasurements. The Ô¨Årst MFCC coefÔ¨Åcient (MFCC0) at the\ntime of onset is used to approximate loudness. Plots of\nMFCC0 for the distance conÔ¨Ågurations are shown in 3(a).\nIn order to capture some of the timbral variation in addi-\ntion to the loudness variation we project our MFCC vectors\nto a single dimension (the Ô¨Årst principal component) using\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) [5]. As can be seen\nin 3(c) the PCA0 values follow closely the loudness curve.\nThis is expected as loudness is the primary characteristic\nthat changes with increasing velocity. However, there is also\nsome information about timbre as can be seen by the ‚Äúnear‚Äù\nplot that has higher variance in PCA0 than in MFCC0.\nOur goal is to obtain a mapping (from user input cali-\nbrated velocity to output driving velocity) such that linear\nchanges in input (MIDI velocity) will yield approximately\nlinear changes in the perceived loudness and timbre as ex-\nperessed in PCA0. We utilize data from all the three dis-\ntance conÔ¨Ågurations for the PCA computation so that the\ntimbrespace is shared. That way even though we get sep-\narate calibration mappings for each distance conÔ¨Åguration\nthey have the property that the same calibrated input value\nwill generate the same output in terms of loudness and tim-\nbre independently of distance.\nIn order to obtain this mapping we quantize the PCA0\nvalues for each distance conÔ¨Åguration into 128 bins that cor-\nrespond to the calibrated input velocities. The generated\n57012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nmapping is the wrong way i.e from output driving velocities\nto calibrated input velocities and is not an injection (one-to-\none function) so it can not be directly inverted. To invert\nthe mapping for each calibrated input velocity (or equiva-\nlently quantized PCA bin) we take the average of all the\noutput driving velocities that map to it as the output driving\nvalue. This calibration mapping is shown in Figure 2. Fig-\nures 3(b) and 3(d) show how changing the calibrated input\nvelocity linearly results in a linearized progression through\nthe timbrespace (PCA0) and loudness (MFCC0). In these\ngraphs we show directly the results of this calibration but\nit is also possible to Ô¨Åt lines to them. In either case (direct\ncalculated mapping or line Ô¨Åt) the calibrated output changes\nsound more smooth than the original output.\n4.3 Gesture recognition using Dynamic Time Warping\nCollaborating musicians frequently utilize high-level cues to\ncommunicate with each other especially in improvisations.\nFor example a jazz ensemble might agree to switch to a dif-\nferent section/rhythm when the saxophone player plays a\nparticular melodic pattern during soloing. This type com-\nmunication through high level cues is difÔ¨Åcult to achieve\nwhen performing with robotic music instruments. In our\nperformances we have utilized a variety of less Ô¨Çexible com-\nmunication strategies including pre-programmed output (the\nsimplest), direct mapping of sensors on a performer to robotic\nactions, and indirect mapping through automatic beat track-\ning. The Ô¨Ånal experiments described in this paper show how\nhigh-level gesture recognition that is robust to changes in\ntempo and pitch contour can be correctly identiÔ¨Åed and used\nas a cue. Our system is Ô¨Çexible and can accept input from\na wide variety of input systems. We show experimental re-\nsults with the radiodrum as well as melodic patterns played\non a vibraphone. There has been considerable work done in\nthe area of using Dynamic Time Warping for gesture recog-\nnition, including work done by Akl and Valaee [1] and Liu\net al. [8].\nFor the Ô¨Årst experiment, we used the most recent itera-\ntion of the radiodrum system, a new instrument designed by\nBob Boie that dramatically outperforms the original radio-\ndrum in terms of both data rate and accuracy. We instructed\na professional musician to generate 8 different instances of\n5 types of gestures, which were an open stroke roll, a sweep\nof the stick through the air, a pinching gesture similar to\nthe pinch to zoom metaphor on touchscreens, a circle in the\nair and a buzz roll. We collected (X,Y,Z )triplets of data\nfrom the sensor at a sample rate of 44100Hz and then down-\nsampled this data to 120Hz to allow us to compare gestures\nthat were on average 1-2 seconds in length while remain-\ning within the memory limits of our computer system. We\nempirically determined that this rate captured most of the\ninformation relevant to gesture recognition.\nFrom this data, the similarity matrix of each gesture toradiodrum Vibraphone\nGestures AP P@1 Gesture AP P@1\nroll 0.866 1.0 pattern1 0.914 1.0\nsweep 0.980 1.0 pattern2 0.812 0.9\npinch 0.837 1.0 pattern3 0.771 0.9\ncircle 1.000 1.0 pattern4 0.882 1.0\nbuzz 0.978 1.0 pattern5 0.616 0.9\nMAP 0.931 1.0 MAP 0.799 0.94\nTable 2 .

Dynamic Time Warping\n[10] is used to compute an alignment score for each pair of\ngestures that correspond to how similar they are. For each\nquery gesture we return a ranked list based on the alignment\nscore and calculate the average precision for each gesture.\nAs can be seen from Table 2 gesture identiÔ¨Åcation is quite\nreliable in both cases.\n5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nWe have shown how techniques from MIR can be adapted\nand used to solve practical problems in music robotics. More\nspeciÔ¨Åcally we show how audio classiÔ¨Åcation can be used\nfor automatic mapping, principal component analysis can\nbe used for velocity/timbre calibration and dynamic time\nwarping for gesture recognition. This system has not yet\nbeen tried in performance, and we are currently working\nwith musicians to deploy this system in a live setting. In\nthe future we plan to extend this work utilizing more sen-\nsors including multiple microphones on both the robot and\nthe performers. To obtain the maximum possible dynamic\nrange we plan to have multiple actuators placed at different\ndistances on the same drum so that the ones that are far are\nused for loud sounds and the ones that are near are used for\nsoft sounds. The proposed calibration method will be used\nto drive seamlessly both actuators. We would also like to\ninvestigate how MIR techniques can be used to ‚Äúteach‚Äù the\nrobot to play and recognize rhythmic and melodic patterns.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nAt the tenth anniversary ISMIR 2009 several contributions\ndiscussed challenges in the further development of music\ninformation retrieval (MIR) as a discipline, including re-\nquests for deeper musical motivation and interpretation of\nMIR questions and results, and envisaging closer interaction\nwith source disciplines such as computer science, cognitive\nscience and musicology [4, 9, 20].\nSuggestions for interdisciplinary collaboration have of-\nten considered musicology as a target discipline, emphasis-\ning the usefulness of MIR tools to musicology (e.g. [18]).\nOccasionally mutual beneÔ¨Åts have been explored (e.g. [15]).\nThe current study addresses associations between MIR and\nmusicology as a source discipline. It presents a systematic\nanalysis of how MIR, as represented at ISMIR, has drawn\non musicology so far, by applying data mining and content\ncitation analysis to musicology references in ISMIR publi-\ncations.\nRelated quantitative ISMIR surveys mainly analyse top-\nics and trends [3, 7, 10].

It brieÔ¨Çy ad-\ndressed citer motivations such as identiÔ¨Åcation of data and\nmethods or paying homage, and concluded that: ‚ÄúWithout a\nmore in-depth analysis of the individual contexts surround-\ning each citation, it is difÔ¨Åcult to tease out the precise mo-\ntivations for all the references‚Äù (p. 61). Functions of refer-\nences to one particular study were discussed in the editorial\nto the JNMR Special Issue on MIR in 2008 [1].\nThis study extends previous work in several ways: It\nanalyses inter-disciplinary references (musicology cited in\nMIR) rather than intra-MIR references; also, the references\nare analysed at the level of MIR and musicology subject cat-\negories instead of individual papers. The quantitative analy-\nsis goes beyond citation counts; association mining is used\nhere to yield interdisciplinary associations. In addition, ci-\ntation contexts are analysed in depth to reveal functions of\nmusicology citations in ISMIR papers, taking into account\nboth MIR-speciÔ¨Åc functions and more general referencing\npurposes to allow comparison with existing studies.\n2. DATA SELECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThis section presents the corpus development and the as-\nsociation mining and citation analysis methods used for ex-\ntracting and analysing associations between musicology and\nmusic information retrieval.\n2.1 Sampling\nFrom the cumulative ISMIR proceedings (www.ismir.net)\nas a sampling frame, Ô¨Årst all available full papers from 2000\nuntil 2007, and all oral/plenary session papers for 2008 to\n2010, were selected. This resulted in 416 papers. Then the\nreference lists of those papers were screened and a purposive\nsample was taken of all papers which contain references to\nmusicology as a source discipline, excluding self-citations\nand references to other ISMIR papers. The Ô¨Ånal analysis\ncorpus consisted of 184 papers. These papers are identiÔ¨Åed\nby their IDs within the cumulative proceedings (e.g. ID135).\n429Poster Session 3\n2.2 Encoding\nThe 184 papers of the analysis corpus were labelled accord-\ning to their MIR research topic and the musicology areas\nthat they cite, using the following categorisations.\nMIR Categories . In a Ô¨Årst step of encoding, the 184\npapers were classiÔ¨Åed into MIR research areas (Table 1).\nAs no single standardised and comprehensive taxonomy of\nMIR topics exists [3,6], an organisation of topics was devel-\noped based on ISMIR calls and programs, harmonising cate-\ngories across conferences. Each ISMIR paper is assigned to\nexactly one MIR category. Numbers in brackets in Table 1\nindicate the number of papers in each category.\nResearch paradigms (6)\nEpistemology, interdisciplinarity\nRepresentation & metrics (24)\nRepresentation, metrics, similarity\nData & metadata (11)\nDatabases, data collection & organisation, metadata, anno-\ntation\nTranscription (42)\nSegmentation, voice & source separation, alignment, beat\ntracking & tempo estimation, key estimation, pitch tracking\n& spelling\nOMR (5)\nOptical music recognition, optical lyrics extraction\nComputational music analysis (21)\nPattern discovery & extraction, summarisation, chord la-\nbelling, musical analysis (melody & bassline, harmonic,\nrhythm and form analysis)\nRetrieval (19)\nQuery-by-example\nClassiÔ¨Åcation (32)\nGenre classiÔ¨Åcation, geographical classiÔ¨Åcation, artist clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation & performer identiÔ¨Åcation, instrument-voice clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation (instrument recognition, instrument vs voice dis-\ntinction, classiÔ¨Åcation of vocal textures), mood & emotion\nclassiÔ¨Åcation\nRecommendation (5)\nRecommendation methods & systems, playlist generation,\nrecommendation contexts\nMusic generation (4)\nMusic prediction, improvisation, interactive instruments\nSoftware systems (10)\nPrototypes & toolboxes, user interfaces & usability, visuali-\nsation\nUser studies (5)\nUser behaviour (music discovery, collection organisation)\nTable 1 .

Thematic categories of musicology.\nMusicology Categories . In a second step, the musicol-\nogy references in the 184 papers were assigned to musicol-\nogy areas (Table 2). As the interest of this study is in mu-\nsicology as a source discipline, the labels used are based\non traditional subject organisations (e.g. [11, 14, 16]) rather\nthan more recent developments such as empirical or com-\nputational musicology which potentially overlap with music\ninformation retrieval (e.g. [18]). Category counts in Table 2\nrefer to the number of ISMIR papers citing this musicology\narea one or more times. A paper may reference more than\none musicology category.\n2.3 Association Mining\nData mining of the analysis corpus is used to reveal asso-\nciations between papers in speciÔ¨Åc MIR categories and pa-\npers that have citations to speciÔ¨Åc musicology categories.\nFor every musicology category Aand MIR category B, the\nsupport (number of papers) s(A)ands(B)were computed.\nAlso the support s(A,B )of an association/angbracketleftA,B/angbracketright(number\nof papers containing references to musicology category A\nwhich are also in MIR category B) and the statistical signif-\nicance of the association were computed.\nThe null hypothesis is that for an association /angbracketleftA,B/angbracketrightthe\ntwo categories are statistically independent, i.e. that the pro-\nportion of papers citing musicology category Athat are in\nMIR category Bdoes not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from the rel-\native frequency of MIR category Bin the general popula-\ntion. Given the small corpus and low counts for many cat-\n43012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\negories, the appropriate test for statistical independence is\nFisher‚Äôs one-tailed exact test on a 2x2 contingency table [5].\nFor an association /angbracketleftA,B/angbracketrightwith support s(A,B ), this gives\nthe probability (p-value) of Ô¨Ånding s(A,B )or more papers\nof category Bins(A)samples (without replacement) in\nn= 184 total papers. If the computed p-value is less than\nthe signiÔ¨Åcance level Œ±= 0.05, then we reject the null hy-\npothesis that the categories are independent.\nPrior to computing the p-values, the counts of all MIR\ncategoriesB(and hence the p-values of associations) are\nslightly adjusted upwards to account for the fact that only\npapers citing musicology were included in the sample of\nn= 184 papers from the larger corpus of 416 papers. Under\nthe null hypothesis of independence, it is assumed that the\nlarger set of papers has the same distribution of MIR cat-\negories as the smaller corpus. The adjustment is done by\nincreasingnto416ands(B)to416√ós(B)/184.\nIn line with the view of musicology as a source disci-\npline, signiÔ¨Åcant associations were oriented into rules from\nmusicology to MIR categories. For every signiÔ¨Åcant associ-\nation/angbracketleftA,B/angbracketright, theconÔ¨Ådence of the oriented rule A‚ÜíBwas\ncomputed as s(A,B )/s(A), indicating the empirical proba-\nbility of a paper being in MIR category Bgiven that it cites\na paper in musicology category A.\n2.4 Content Citation Analysis of Referencing Functions\nPapers supporting signiÔ¨Åcant associations were analysed in\nmore detail to reveal functions of musicology references.\nStudies of citation behaviour have proposed several clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcations of citer motivation (e.g. [2, 12, 13, 17]). In our\nanalysis, we are mainly interested in (a) the function of the\nreference in the citing paper rather than conclusions about\nthe cited work, and (b) referencing purposes that can be sug-\ngested from the content of the citing paper and the co-text of\nthe citation. Musicology references were analysed in their\ncontext in the ISMIR paper, and recurring referencing func-\ntions extracted and linked to existing citation classiÔ¨Åcations.\n3. RESULTS\nThis section presents the associations and referencing func-\ntions uncovered in the corpus.\n3.1 Associations\nFigure 1 presents the network of all associations with sup-\nport‚â•3extracted by the association mining method de-\nscribed in Section 2.3. The Ô¨Ågure highlights that MIR areas\ngenerally draw on more than one musicology discipline. But\nthere are differences in the level of co-citation, i.e. occur-\nrences within the same ISMIR papers: For example, eight\nout of the ten papers on representation and metrics which\ncite music theory and analysis literature also cite psycholog-\nical work on perception and cognition. On the other hand,perception and cognition research and acoustics are cited by\ndifferent subsets of papers on transcription.\nComparing Figure 1 against MIR topics in Table 1, addi-\ntional links could have been expected e.g. between papers\non data and metadata and references to textual criticism,\narchival research and bibliography or history of music [15]\nor between classiÔ¨Åcation and performance studies (for per-\nformer identiÔ¨Åcation), acoustics (for instrument-voice clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation) and popular music studies or history of music (for\ngenre classiÔ¨Åcation). However, these relations are supported\nby only one or two papers each and thus do not appear\nin Figure 1. Surprisingly, the category of ethnomusicology\n(folk music) (Table 2) does not feature in associations with\nMIR categories above the support threshold.\nOf the 21 associations shown in Figure 1, nine are statis-\ntically signiÔ¨Åcant (Section 2.3). Table 3 enumerates those\nassociations that have a p-value less than Œ±= 0.05. In\nFigure 1 these particular associations are shown in bold lines,\nwith a directed arrow indicating in brackets the conÔ¨Ådence\nof the oriented rule. Overall the relatively low conÔ¨Ådence\nvalues conÔ¨Årm that in general musicology areas are cited\nacross MIR categories.\nGenerally an association will be signiÔ¨Åcant if the asso-\nciation support s(A,B )is high relative to the size of one\ninvolved category. Here this applies in particular for small\ncategories like ethnomusicology (non-Western), OMR, user\nstudies or recommendation. SigniÔ¨Åcance becomes harder to\nachieve for associations between large categories; it is more\nlikely to achieve the observed level of support at random\ngiven the individual category distributions in the corpus. For\nexample, perception and cognition research is linked to sev-\neral MIR categories with high support, but the distribution\nof those MIR categories across the 93 papers citing percep-\ntion and cognition does not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly from their\ndistribution across all sampled papers.\n3.2 Referencing Functions\nFor the content citation analysis we selected the ISMIR pa-\npers supporting the associations in Table 3, as these papers\nare examples of musicology and MIR categories that are\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly correlated. Of these 47 papers, 17 papers (5\ncomputational music analysis papers, 8 representation and\nmetrics papers and 4 retrieval papers) also cite perception\nand cognition research; these references were also consid-\nered. The in-depth analysis of citation contexts in these\npapers demonstrates that musicology is used for a variety\nof purposes. Figure 2 presents a taxonomy of referencing\nfunctions and the references‚Äô contribution in the MIR work\n(boxes), with examples of co-text.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe Ô¨Åndings presented in this study are based on direct and\nexplicit references to musicology. However, not all refer-\nences are explicit: papers sometimes refer to musicologi-\ncal work reported in earlier MIR publications; incorporate\nconcepts or approaches like music-analytical methods into\nthe main text without including speciÔ¨Åc references; charac-\nterise the considered repertoire such as non-Western tradi-\ntions without making explicit whether the description is de-\nrived from musicological research, common cultural knowl-\nedge or the researchers‚Äô personal experience; or use music\nexamples without citing a musicological source. Taking into\naccount such references is expected to strengthen rather than\nchange the picture of associations presented here.\nFor this study the analysis corpus only contained full IS-\nMIR papers (Section 2.1). Future work could extend the\ncorpus to also include posters, in particular those from IS-\nMIR 2008 onward (because these are of equal length and\nstatus to full papers); apply multilevel association mining\nmethods [8] to hierarchical subject categorisations; allow a\npaper to be within multiple MIR categories; and evaluate\nwhether the associations found here persist and whether new\nsigniÔ¨Åcant associations arise. Furthermore, if an encoding\nof the complete ISMIR proceedings was available, other in-\nteresting types of analysis would be possible, e.g. exploringwhether certain MIR areas are over- or under-represented in\nthe corpus of papers citing musicology, or comparing use of\nmusicology references against other source disciplines like\ncomputer science or cognitive science.\nSeveral observations can be drawn from the results pre-\nsented in this paper. First, less than half of the full papers\nin the cumulative ISMIR proceedings (184 out of 416) cite\nmusicology. Given the close interdisciplinary links between\nMIR and musicology a larger percentage had been expected.\nSecond, the most frequently cited category is music per-\nception and cognition research (93 citing papers across all\nMIR categories in our corpus). On the other hand, histor-\nical musicology and especially history of music appear to\nbe under-represented in our corpus, compared to their tra-\nditional weight in musicology [16]. Third, the association\nmining has revealed signiÔ¨Åcant associations between certain\nmusicology and MIR categories. However, most pairings\nare not signiÔ¨Åcant, and this may indicate opportunities for\ncategory reÔ¨Ånement and for speciÔ¨Åc interdisciplinary collab-\noration. Fourth, the content citation analysis yields a range\nof citation purposes, from justifying the MIR topic and spec-\nifying the MIR task, through informing methods or provid-\ning data, to references which demonstrate awareness of the\nresearch context but remain without direct implications for\nthe MIR work.\n433Poster Session 3\nFollowing the discussions at ISMIR 2009 [4, 9, 20], in\nthe further development of MIR we would expect that with\nthe increasing interest in ethnic music (e.g. [3, 19]) ethno-\nmusicology will more strongly feed not only into classiÔ¨Å-\ncation but also MIR areas such as representation and met-\nrics, transcription or retrieval; envisage more musicology\nreferences, including history of music, in deÔ¨Åning MIR re-\nsearch questions and in interpreting MIR results; and en-\ncourage more projective references highlighting potential of\nMIR achievements for musicology, beyond providing tech-\nnological tools. The association mining and content analy-\nsis methods applied in this paper will be invaluable to study\nthe continuing evolution of the Ô¨Åeld of music information\nretrieval.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nOnset Detection, Automatic Transcription, or Audio Align-\nment are only a small number of examples of MIR tasks that\nrequire ground truth data at the note-level for an in-depth\nevaluation. However, such data corpora are rare for several\nreasons. Starting from an audio recording, manual anno-\ntation is not only highly time consuming but also has cer-\ntain limits in terms of accuracy and level of detail. On the\none hand, it is questionable how precisely or consistently\na human annotator can determine note onsets ‚Äì particularly\n‚Äúsoft‚Äù ones. On the other hand, aspects like the loudness of\nan individual chord note might not be distinguishable even\nfor experienced listeners.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.\nMan.\nSynth.\nDiskl.\nAudio Onset Detection X\nReal-Time Audio to Score Alignment X\nAudio Melody Extraction X\nMultiple f0Estimation and Tracking X X X\nAudio Chord Estimation X\nAudio Beat Tracking X\nTable 1 . Overview of MIREX tasks and the respective\nsources of test data (manual annotation, synthesized from\nMIDI, playback on a Disklavier)\nStarting from a symbolic representation implies its own\nchallenges. To obtain a realistic audio representation, two\naspects have to be taken into account. First, the symbolic\ndata should describe a human-like performance, i.e. contain\nartistic variations in tempo, dynamics, or playing style and\nalso more subtle ones such as slight arpeggiations or asyn-\nchronies.\nThe second important aspect is the quality of the conver-\nsion from the symbolic to the audio domain. One option\nis to use computer controlled musical instruments (e.g. a\nplayer piano) preserving the whole acoustic complexity of\nthe sound source. Problems are the availability of such in-\nstruments and recording issues. An alternative would be the\nusage of (software) synthesizers. Although this method is\nrelatively common in the literature (see [2, 3, 8] for exam-\nple), it is not clear if and to what extent such data yields\ndifferent results in an evaluation process.\nTable 1 gives an overview of MIREX [4] tasks which re-\nquire note- or at least beat-level annotations for evaluation\npurposes. With the exception of one single task, where au-\ndio material is generated from a symbolic ground truth rep-\nresentation, there is a clear preference towards the usage of\n‚Äúreal‚Äù audio recordings and human annotations. However,\nit is not clear if this under-representation of evaluation data\ngenerated from a known ground truth is due to a lack of\n543Poster Session 4\nsuch symbolic data and adequate rendering mechanisms, or\nif such audio material would indeed adulterate evaluation\nresults.\nThis work presents a study on different approaches for\nthe generation of audio data from symbolic representation\nand their inÔ¨Çuence on evaluation results of two MIR algo-\nrithms ‚Äì Onset Detection and Audio Alignment. To this end,\nMIDI data from real piano performances were turned into\naudio recordings in three ways: (i) by recording the sound\nproduced by a computer-controlled piano when playing the\nMIDI Ô¨Åles; (ii) by synthesizing the data using a commercial\nhigh-quality sample library; and (iii) by using a freely avail-\nable sound patch library. Also, since performances of pro-\nfessional musicians are rarely available in a symbolic repre-\nsentation, the inÔ¨Çuence of changes in the richness of artistic\nvariations (i.e. changing tempo, dynamics, pedal pressure)\nwas studied. The piano was chosen due to the availability\nof computer controlled instruments and thus the opportu-\nnity to obtain highly accurate audio data other version can\nbe compared to. Also, piano music is a common means of\nnote-level evaluation in literature.\n2. EVALUATION TASKS\nTo examine the effect of different sound sources on the per-\nformance of MIR algorithms, two sample subÔ¨Åelds have\nbeen selected ‚Äì (i) Onset Detection and (ii) Audio Align-\nment. These two task are representative insofar as they allow\ncertain conclusions to be drawn about various other MIR\ntasks they are either integral parts of (such as Audio Tran-\nscription or Cover Version Detection) or share crucial sub-\nroutines or features (such as Score Following, Structural\nAnalysis, or Beat Tracking).\n2.1 Onset Detection\nThe chosen algorithm for Onset Detection is the one that\nyielded the highest average f-measure in the MIREX 20101\nalgorithm comparison [5].\n2.1.1 Features\nFeatures are extracted in the spectral domain. The signal is\ntherefore transformed using two parallel STFTs with Ham-\nming windows of lengths 1024 (23 ms) and 2048 (46 ms)\nrespectively. The hop size, however, is 441 samples in both\ncases yielding a common time resolution of 10 ms per frame.\nAccording to the human perception of sounds, the (power)\nspectrograms are then converted to the Mel-scale using a\nÔ¨Ålterbank consisting of 40 triangular Ô¨Ålters spread equidis-\ntantly on the Mel-scale. In a last step, the logarithm is taken\nto obtain the Ô¨Ånal feature values.\n1MIREX 2010 ‚Äì Onset Detection Results\nhttp://nema.lis.illinois.edu/nema_out/mirex2010/\nresults/aod/summary.htmlIn addition to the absolute values, the half-wave rectiÔ¨Åed\nÔ¨Årst order difference is calculated as an indicator for new\nspectral components.\n2.1.2 Algorithm\nAs most other Onset Detection algorithms, the one used here\nworks in two steps. In the Ô¨Årst one, a detection function\nis calculated, representing novelty within the signal. In a\nsecond pass, peaks in the detection function are picked and\nclassiÔ¨Åed as onsets.\nTo obtain the detection function, a bidirectional neural\nnetwork with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units is\napplied. Its number of input units is 160, corresponding\nto the feature values as described above. The actual neu-\nral net consists of six hidden layers ‚Äì two for each direction\n‚Äì with 20 LSTM units each and two output units yoandyn\nrepresenting the classes ‚Äôonset‚Äô and ‚Äôno onset‚Äô respectively.\nThese outputs are normalized such that the range of values\nis[0,1]and the sum of yoandynis 1.\nTraining of the network was done iteratively by gradi-\nent descent with error backpropagation until no more im-\nprovement has been observed for 20 epochs. The training\nand validation sets used consist of samples from the dataset\nintroduced be Bello et al. [1] and the ballroom dataset by\nGouyon et al. [7].\nThe peak picking on the detection function applies a sim-\nple thresholding approach where a Ô¨Åxed threshold depend-\ning on the median of the detection function is determined\nfor each piece. Each remaining peak is Ô¨Ånally reported as\nan onset.\n2.2 Audio-to-Score Alignment\nConcerning audio alignment, a simple algorithm based on\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Chroma vectors has\nbeen chosen. Although this approach dates back several\nyears and improvements concerning aspects like robustness\nor accuracy have been proposed, it is still used not only\nfor Audio-to-Score Alignment itself but also for Structural\nAnalysis, Cover Version Detection or Retrieval Tasks. For\nsimplicity reasons, the Audio-to-Score Alignment task will\nbe referred to as Audio Alignment only in the remainder of\nthis work.\n2.2.1 Features\nDue to their robustness to timbre, certain recording condi-\ntions, and varying degrees of polyphony, chroma vectors are\ncommonly used for synchronization tasks. They consist of\na 12-dimensional vector for each time frame, where each\nelement represents the relative energy of a pitch class (i.e.\nC, C#, D,. . . ). The extraction from audio signals is done in\nthe spectral domain based on a mapping of each bin to the\nnote where the fundamental frequency is closest to the bin‚Äôs\ncenter frequency. In a second step, coefÔ¨Åcients of all bins\n54412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nmapped to notes of the same pitch class are summed up. Fi-\nnally, the vector is normalized by linear scaling such that its\nmaximum is equal to 1.\nThe (mechanic) score representation is segmented into\ntime frames such that the number of time frames and the\noverlap ratio are the same as for the corresponding audio\ndata. The energy of a pitch is then set to the fraction of the\nwindow length in which it is played. The octave folding and\nnormalization is then performed in analogous manner as for\nthe audio data.\n2.2.2 Algorithm\nTo compute the actual alignment, the approach described\nin [10] is used. In a Ô¨Årst pass, features are computed on\nwindows with a length of 4096 samples and an overlap ra-\ntio of 50%. Dynamic Time Warping is then performed to\nobtain an initial alignment. The resulting time resolution\nis relatively low. However, since the Dynamic Time Warp-\ning algorithm is of quadratic complexity in time and also in\nspace, this is necessary to also process long pieces.\nTo circumvent this tradeoff, a second pass is performed\nat a higher time resolution. Here, the features are calcu-\nlated using a window length of 1024 samples and a hop size\nof 256 samples. Computational costs are kept low by re-\nstricting the search for an optimal alignment to a certain area\naround the coarse initial alignment. Here, a radius of ¬±1000\nframes has been chosen.\n3. EVALUATION DATA\nThe data set used throughout this study comprises the Ô¨Årst\nmovements of 13 piano sonatas by W. A. Mozart. Those\npieces have been performed by a professional pianist on\na computer monitored grand piano (B ¬®osendorfer SE 290),\nyielding an exact ground truth of all performance parame-\nters including timing, dynamics, and pedal pressure. The\ndata was originally represented in a proprietary, symbolic\nformat which was then converted into MIDI. As shown in\nTable 2, it covers almost 42000 notes and a performance\ntime of more than 80 minutes.\nFor the purpose of evaluation, the performance data was\nmatched to a symbolic score representation. Manual correc-\ntion was done, to ensure that playing errors and also short\nsections where the pianist did not stick to the score at all are\nannotated accordingly.\nAudio recordings were then obtained from this perfor-\nmance data using three different sources ‚Äì playback on the\nB¬®osendorfer 290 SE from which the symbolic data origi-\nnated, synthesizing using high quality instrument samples\nproduced by the Vienna Symphonic Library , and rendering\nusing the free synthesizer Timidity and its default instrument\npatches provided by the Freepats project.3.1 B ¬®osendorfer SE 290\nThe B ¬®osendorfer SE 290 is the computer controlled grand\npiano which was used to obtain the symbolic performance\ndata. It relies on optical sensors to detect movements of\nindividual keys and hammers. One such sensor consists\nof a phototransistor and a coupled LED about 3 mm apart.\nPrecision-cut aluminum shutters attached to the keys and\nhammers discontinue the corresponding beam of light and\nthus trigger a sensor event. The system is set up such that\na key movement is reported as soon as it is minutely de-\npressed. A hammer movement and its velocity, on the other\nhand, are detected at the instant a hammer hits the string [9].\nThe playback mechanism is based on small linear motors\nunderneath the key bed actuating the keys. They are con-\nstructed such that the only contact between key and actuator\nis during playback mode and no interference occurs while a\npianist is playing the instrument.\nIn [6] the SE 290 was compared to the Yamaha Disklavier\ngrand piano ‚Äì another system commonly used in perfor-\nmance research. It has been found that the SE 290 is more\naccurate than the Disklavier at monitoring and also at play-\nback. Both systems were affected by systematic timing de-\nviations (linearly increasing over time) likely to be caused\nby inaccuracies of the internal clock-pulse generators. This\nÔ¨Çaw aside, the residual mean timing errors in monitoring\nmode accounted for 0.2 ms (stddev: 2.1 ms) for B ¬®osendor-\nfer‚Äôs and for 1.4 ms (stddev: 3.8 ms) for Yamaha‚Äôs grand pi-\nano. Considering reproduction accuracy, the Disklavier was\nagain clearly outperformed by the SE system where timing\ndeviations rarely exceeded 3 ms.\nThe recordings on this instrument were made at 44.1 kHz\nusing a single high-quality microphone near the corpus of\nthe piano and a DAT recorder.\n3.2 Vienna Symphonic Library\nThe Vienna Symphonic Library2(VSL) is a commercial\nvendor of high quality instrument samples not only cover-\ning a wide range of musical instruments but also different\nplaying styles. While synthesizing MIDI data, a special se-\nquencer plug-in analyzes the stream of events for repeated\nnotes and other certain patterns and determines the appropri-\nate articulation or nuance in real-time. An example are pas-\nsages played in legato on wind or string instruments, where\nnot only tones themselves but also real note transitions are\nsampled to yield a more natural sound.\nTheSpecial Edition ‚Äì Standard of the sample library con-\ntains the B ¬®osendorfer 290 ‚ÄùImperial‚Äú, which is the same\ntype of grand piano the SE system, as described above, was\nintegrated into. This provides the opportunity to compare\nthe authentic sound of the grand piano to its generated repro-\nduction. The objective is to show if and how potential devi-\n2http://vsl.co.at/\n545Poster Session 4\nations inÔ¨Çuence MIR algorithms and their respective evalu-\nation results.\nSince the software is not a sequencer of its own, Garage-\nBand3was used for synthesizing. Although GarageBand\ncan not be considered a high-end product, the audio mate-\nrial obtained as described above beneÔ¨Åts from the plug-in\nprovided by the VSL.\n3.3 Timidity++/Freepats\nTimidity++4is a free software synthesizer distributed under\nthe GNU General Public License and available for a variety\nof operating systems. Although it can be conÔ¨Ågured to work\nwith any set of instrument samples given in GUS/patch for-\nmat, it, by default, uses the voice data provided by the Freep-\nats5project. Timidity has been included in this comparison\nbecause, on the one hand, the software as well as the instru-\nment samples are freely available and, on the other hand, it\nhas been used in recent MIR research (e.g. [2, 3, 8]).\n4. DIFFERENT RENDERING METHODS\nIn a Ô¨Årst experiment, the inÔ¨Çuence of the rendering method\nwas examined. Therefore, audio signals were obtained from\nthe three sources as described above ‚Äì the computer con-\ntrolled B ¬®osendorfer SE 290 grand piano, the Vienna Sym-\nphonic Library, and Timidity using its default sound patches.\nThe results yielded by the Onset Detection and the Audio-\nto-Score Alignment are shown in Table 2. The Onset De-\ntection performance is determined analogous to the MIREX\nevaluation. The reported onsets are compared to the ground\ntruth allowing a timing deviation of ¬±50 ms. The quality of\nthe result is then given in terms of the f-measure. The accu-\nracy of the Audio Alignment is expressed by the percentage\nof individual notes for which the onset time in the alignment\ndeviates by also less than 50 ms from the ground truth.\nThe evaluation presented here deviates from the one per-\nformed at MIREX in one aspect, which is, however, justiÔ¨Åed\nby the nature of the ground truth data. Merged onsets, i.e.\ntwo adjacent onsets are reported as one single onset, are not\npenalized here. Since each individual note‚Äôs onset time is\nknown, it occurs that there is more than one onset within a\nsingle or two adjacent audio frames. Such onsets cannot be\ndistinguished without also transcribing the notes‚Äô pitches.\nConcerning the Onset Detection, the performance on the\ndata synthesized using the Vienna Symphonic Library is the\nhighest on all individual pieces with only one exception ‚Äì\nk283-1 ‚Äì where the signal from the SE 290 yields the high-\nest f-value. On the other hand, the audio data obtained from\nTimidity results in the lowest f-measure for each piece. This\n3http://www.apple.com/de/ilife/garageband/\n4http://timidity.sourceforge.net\n5http://freepats.zenvoid.orgcontradicts the possible speculation that lower quality syn-\nthesizers (instrument patches) would produce somehow ‚Äùar-\ntiÔ¨Åcial‚Äù sounds and in doing so reduce the complexity of the\nresulting audio Ô¨Åle. Looking at the spectra of two tones ‚Äì\none played on the SE 290 and one generated by timidity ‚Äì\nreveals that the tone obtained from timidity contains a sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant proportion of noise in the high frequency bins (see\nFigure 1). This phenomenon was observed to be consistent\nthroughout the whole pitch range and is therefore a likely\nexplanation for the worse performance of the Onset Detec-\ntion on the timidity dataset.\nAlthough the evaluation of the Audio Alignment does\nnot draw such a clear picture, some of the results are con-\nÔ¨Årmed. Again, the performance on the timidity dataset was\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly lower than the one on the ‚Äùreal‚Äú audio from\nthe SE 290. However, the VSL dataset results in the lowest\noverall accuracy. Comparing the spectra of tones generated\nby the VSL to those played on the SE 290 shows differences\nin the relative strengths of individual harmonics. This will\ninÔ¨Çuence the chroma feature and is therefore a likely expla-\nnation for the discrepancy in the results.\n5. VARYING RICHNESS OF EXPRESSIVE\nDETAILS\nThe symbolic representation used to obtain the audio ma-\nterials for the above experiment derives from a real perfor-\nmance (on the Boesendorfer SE290) by a skilled concert pi-\nanist. It thus contains detailed information about expressive\nperformance aspects (expressive timing, dynamics nuances,\nexact pressure on the pedals). In many controlled MIR ex-\nperiments, the starting MIDI data will be based on a score\ninstead of real performances, and will therefore be impover-\nished in the sense that it will not correspond to the kind of\nmusical material usually encountered in practice.\nIn order to Ô¨Ånd out whether the lack (or presence) of ex-\npressive timing etc. signiÔ¨Åcantly impact MIR algorithms,\nour MIDI Ô¨Åles were deliberately ‚Äùcleaned‚Äù from such ex-\npressive performance aspects. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the usage of the\npedals, varying dynamics, and intra-chord timings (i.e. ar-\npeggiations and asynchronies) were suppressed by deleting\nthe according events, setting velocities to a constant, and as-\nsigning asynchronous chord notes a uniform onset time.\nThe means of synthesizing was chosen to be timidity for\ntwo reasons. First, we assumed that if a computer controlled\ninstrument were available, it could be used to obtain the\ncomplete performance information. Second, the VSL soft-\nware and its mechanism to use different samples according\nto the musical context would interfere with the experiment.\nWe found that suppressing the usage of the pedals, chang-\ning dynamics, or both had only negligible inÔ¨Çuence on the\noverall performance. Likely explanations are that the us-\nage of pedals plays a relatively minor role when performing\n54612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\npiece # notes durationOnset Detection Audio-to-Score Alignment\nSE 290 VSL timidity SE 290 VSL timidity\nk279-1 2803 4:55 96.31 98.00 92.11 90.37 85.52 87.73\nk280-1 2491 4:48 98.08 98.80 95.64 85.27 79.37 85.47\nk281-1 2648 4:29 95.83 97.83 92.20 88.37 85.08 86.48\nk282-1 1907 7:35 97.70 98.87 96.42 76.68 71.93 74.93\nk283-1 3304 5:22 97.08 96.53 92.45 93.89 85.05 90.89\nk284-1 3700 5:17 94.82 98.58 93.40 92.08 90.35 86.97\nk330-1 3160 6:14 97.19 99.32 95.50 95.13 90.03 90.19\nk331-1 6123 13:35 98.02 98.50 95.55 73.00 66.62 70.70\nk332-1 3470 6:02 94.84 98.26 94.01 87.61 83.52 81.07\nk333-1 3774 6:44 96.83 98.31 93.13 93.51 93.19 92.29\nk457-1 2993 6:15 95.92 96.80 92.33 88.31 79.45 80.09\nk475-1 1284 4:58 96.69 98.29 95.60 61.21 59.04 43.04\nk533-1 4339 8:25 95.30 98.11 94.06 92.90 87.14 89.91\nall 41994 1:24.39 96.51 98.18 94.00 86.85 81.93 82.99\nTable 2 .

Also, the chroma vectors used for Audio\nAlignment are normalized to reduce the inÔ¨Çuence of vary-\ning loudness and the neural network seems to have learned\na similar concept.\nHowever, the inÔ¨Çuence of micro timings (i.e. asynchro-\nnies) on the Audio Alignment was signiÔ¨Åcant compared to\na version where the onsets of all notes of a chord were set\nto same time (see Table 3). This is partly due to the fact\nthat Audio-to-Score Alignment using Dynamic Time Warp-\ning without post-processing at the note-level is inherently\nerror prone as soon as asynchronies occur. The algorithm\ncannot assign different times to events which are simultane-\nous in the score.\nAlthough we expected the Onset Detection to also ben-\neÔ¨Åt substantially from having one simultaneous onset for\na whole chord instead of several onsets of the individual\nnotes, results disproved this assumption. A further inspec-tion showed that while chord onsets have been correctly de-\ntected, onsets of notes played one at a time were missed.\nThis is due to a masking effect caused be the exceptionally\nhigh values in the detection function caused by the exact\nconcurrence of several notes‚Äô onsets.\nTo get an idea on the actual extent of asynchronies in\na natural performance, the time spreads of chords according\nto their degree of polyphony was determined. Table 4 shows\nthat two notes which are notated concurrently in the score\ncan be up to half a second apart in the actual performance,\nhighlighting that natural timings contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to\nthe complexity of a musical performance.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the development of western music, handwritten scores\nand parts have played a signiÔ¨Åcant role even after the inven-\ntion of making prints because they allowed composers to ex-\npress their ideas in a personalized way. In manuscripts, the\nwriter‚Äôs intention is assumed to be present, and manuscripts\nare often the only surviving witness for them and their work,\nand for this reason, they should be analyzed with utmost\ncare and attention.\nAlthough optical music recognition (OMR) has been in-\nvestigated actively for this, there has been little research in-\nvestigating such aspects of music manuscripts beyond OMR.\nEnote history1[3, 4] and the researches by Fornes [10] are\nsuch examples, which deals with such as writer identiÔ¨Åca-\ntion or how just a subtle change of handwriting could reveal\nthe situation under which the writer was working.\nThis paper explores the analysis of Bach‚Äôs C-clefs and we\nassociates the image processing issues. C-clefs have been\n1Enote history is a name of the project which mainly concerns scriber\nidentiÔ¨Åcation in handwritten music manuscripts from the 18th century. This\nwas achieved by the cooperation of several research institutes: the library\nof the university of Rostock, the department of musicology at the univer-\nsity of Rostock, the database research group at the department of computer\nscience, and the Fraunhofer institute for computer graphics.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.identiÔ¨Åed by Bach scholars as one of the most crucial criteria\nto date the manuscript. Musicologists such as Dadelsen [21]\nand Emery [9] claim that Bach‚Äôs C-clef can be categorized\ninto three or four groups and each group mainly appears\nin a speciÔ¨Åc period. Dadelsen applied this to identiÔ¨Åcation\nof the chronological order of Bach‚Äôs manuscripts. One of\nthe weaknesses of their discussions seems to be the lack of\nany quantitative evaluation of their hypothesis. Their inves-\ntigation is apparently supported by their deep background\nknowledge and experience, which cannot be easily emulated\nby computer. This lack of reproducibility of their research\ncan be addressed in the musicology of the future. High re-\nproducibility is in fact one of the biggest advantages of com-\nputational analysis.\nFigure 1 shows the C-clefs found in Bach‚Äôs manuscripts\narranged in a chronological order suggested by musicolo-\ngists [14], which demonstrates that the shape of Bach‚Äôs hand-\nwriting changed over time. Bach scholars investigate the is-\nsue of chronology by examining various types of evidence\nholistically. Evidence typically include watermarks, hand-\nwriting, a documented use of the manuscripts giving clues\nto speciÔ¨Åc dates, notational styles, and librettists. It seems\nrisky, therefore, to draw a conclusion by contemplating only\na single type of evidence such as C-clefs.\nHowever, computational analysis can offer a totally ob-\njective and independent result, which can then be combined\nwith other sources and knowledge such as the evidence men-\ntioned above, which will hopefully lead to more reliable re-\nsults. Can computational analysis offer the same conclu-\nsions as those arrived at by musicologists? The remainder\nof the paper is focused on this question by addressing the\ncomputational analysis of C-clefs.\n2. IMAGE PROCESSING OF BACH‚ÄôS\nMANUSCRIPTS\nThe extraction of C-clefs from the manuscripts requires ac-\ncurate segmentation. However, the segmentation of old hand-\nwritten manuscripts proves to be a difÔ¨Åcult task [6,17]. The\nmain difÔ¨Åculty seems to be caused by degradation such as\nshow-through and bleed-through effects.\n417Poster Session 3\n(a) 1708\n (b) 1723\n (c) 1733\n (d) 1736\n (e) 1739\n (f) 1748\nFigure 1 .

Two results of staff-line removal; almost all the\nstaff-lines are left in (d).\nAs text line localization is the essential part of the OCR\nprocess [12], staff line detection is one of the most difÔ¨Å-\ncult but important aspects of OMR, since staff lines, which\nare used to give meaning to certain symbols such as note-\nheads, prevent the segmentation of musical symbols. Al-\nthough there are arguments about the necessity of the staff-\nline removal, most research regards it as essential. The vol-\nume of research dealing with staff-line detection and re-\nmoval [5, 7, 8, 15, 16, 19] indicates the difÔ¨Åculty inherent in\nthis process, especially in the case of handwritten music.\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\n (e)\nFigure 3 .

This\nhappened especially when the staff-lines were curved or sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly thinner than usual. Figure 2 shows typical results\nof the staff-line removal. In addition to the difÔ¨Åculty inher-\nent in the staff-line removal from the manuscripts, Bach‚Äôs\ndense notation and the irrelevant pixels, which are most com-\nmonly resulted from the degradation of paper, cause touch-\ning symbols. Moreover, unclear and degraded manuscripts\nare often fragmented by binarization process. These prob-\nlems make it difÔ¨Åcult to automatically decide bounding box\nof each musical symbol.\nAs it still requires further work to resolve these difÔ¨Åcul-\nties, for the present study we decided to collect C-clefs by\nmanually deciding the bounding box. Figure 3 shows the\nC-clef extracted by this method. This extraction is followed\nby both morphological operation and staff-line removal to\nprocure clear image, in order to prepare for the feature ex-\ntraction. This is shown in Figure 3(b) and (c).\n3. EXPERIMENT\nThis section explores the classiÔ¨Åcation of the C-clefs.

The detailed information of this is shown in Ta-\nble 1.3We prepared two classiÔ¨Åcation tasks using the same\ndataset: one is eight-class classiÔ¨Åcation using the date pro-\nposed by Kobayashi as the label; the other is two-class clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation which only distinguishes between A B C and D E\nF G H. This corresponds to determining if a certain clef was\nwritten before Bach arrived at Leipzig (i.e. May 1723) to\nassume his role as Thomas cantor as well as the director of\nmusic for the town, or after that date.\nFeature selection is also an important factor for success-\nful classiÔ¨Åcation. For the present study, 15 features imple-\nmented in Gamera were used. Each feature is explained as\nfollows4\n‚Ä¢area\nThe area of the bounding box.\n‚Ä¢aspect ratio\nThe aspect ratio of the bounding box.\n‚Ä¢black area\nThe number of black pixels.\n‚Ä¢compactness\nThe volume to surface ratio.\n‚Ä¢moments\nThe centre of gravity on xandyaxis normalized by\nwidth and height.\n‚Ä¢ncols feature\nThe number of columns.\n‚Ä¢nholes\nThe averaged number of white runs not touching the\nborder.

RBF kernel was used as the kernel func-\ntion of SVM, and this was automatically estimated from the\nresult of a preliminary experiment. CART Algorithm was\nused as underlying classiÔ¨Åers for all the ensemble classiÔ¨Åers\nand the other parameters were set as default.\nTable 2 shows the result of 10-fold cross-validation. The\nbest accuracy for two-class classiÔ¨Åcation was 89.95% ob-\ntained by random forest. This accuracy seems signiÔ¨Åcant\nconsidering that the classiÔ¨Åcation of Bach‚Äôs handwriting has\nbeen attempted by only a few experts. The eight-class clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation is far more complicated and thus extremely dif-\nÔ¨Åcult even for human experts. The best accuracy 73.82%\nwas achieved by RF for eight-class classiÔ¨Åcation, which is\nin itself remarkable.

The misclas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation of A to B seems to be caused by a small sample\nsize of A compared to B. In Table 4, the misclassiÔ¨Åcation\nof classes such as A D and H into F is noticeable. This\nresult implies that classes with a low sample size tends to\nbe classiÔ¨Åed as the class with a large sample size such as\nF. It is interesting that class G is classiÔ¨Åed with fairly high\naccuracy although it has small sample size. This is proba-\nbly because the deviation of the shapes of the C-clefs in G\nis small enough to achieve the high classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy\neven with small sample data.\n4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this study, we proposed a new method to work out the\nchronology of music manuscripts by classifying the shape of\nC-clefs. Applying a battery of techniques to Bach‚Äôs manuscripts\nrevealed the limitation of the current image processing tech-\nniques. The method of classifying C-clefs using 15 features\nand RF produced a result of 89.95% accuracy in two-class\nclassiÔ¨Åcation and 73.82% in eight-class classiÔ¨Åcation.\nThe automatic collection of musical symbols from Bach‚Äôs\nmanuscripts proves to be a challenging task, but is worth in-\nvestigating further. The accuracy of C-clef classiÔ¨Åcation canbe improved by investigating the implementation of musi-\ncal knowledge, and this should be explored in collaboration\nwith musicologists. In this study, we assumed that all the\nclefs from the same page were written in the same period.\nHowever, there is deviation in shape even in the clefs on the\nsame page and sometimes they looked as if they were added\nsubsequently or even possibly by a different hand. For this\nlevel of analysis, it requires more sophisticated image pro-\ncessing techniques that are capable of handling more subtle\nchanges in each music symbol.\nChronological identiÔ¨Åcation is not a straightforward task.\nIn contrast to OMR system, musicologists would take a com-\nplex approach, combining it with chronological, composi-\ntional, and notational information, placing them against the\nhistorical background of the source such as the situation un-\nder which the initial copying and revisions took place, the\ndiplomatic polices that might reveal the purpose for which\nthe score was made, and so on, to verify the initial hypoth-\nesis. It is hoped that quantiÔ¨Åcation and statistical analyses\nsuch as what demonstrated in this paper will be perfected in\nfuture research, and that they are adopted by future musicol-\nogists to discover many more exciting facts hidden deep in\nthe beautiful manuscripts of Johann Sebastian Bach.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThe idea of having a computer perform like human musician\narose more than two decades ago. There have been various\nproposals for making a computer understand the rich expres-\nsion of a performance [2]. Historically, the mainstream ap-\nproach to capturing the nuances of performance has changed\nfrom rule-based methods to learning-based methods. One\nmodel that shows the effectiveness of the latter approach\nis represented by the generative model. Also, there is an-\nother motivation for this kind of research, that is, learning\nwhat makes a performance humanlike; however, there are\nfew initiatives based on such questions. One approach to\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.analyze performance statistically, by capturing the trends of\nthe performance in the acoustic features, has already been\nattempted [3, 8, 10, 11]. These studies are admirable in that\ntheir veriÔ¨Åcation used a large quantity of expressive perfor-\nmance; we also essentially agree that it is desirable to per-\nform the veriÔ¨Åcation with such an approach. However, it\nis difÔ¨Åcult to observe the expressiveness of a performance\nfrom diverse perspectives by these approaches as expres-\nsiveness consists of various factors. We adopt a MIDI-based\napproach to simplify such problems, and consider a variety\nof expressive representations notated on the musical score as\nthe factor that describes how the expressive performance has\nbeen generated. In addition, our method to capture the per-\nformance is based on the idea of a generative model. There-\nfore, our method has the potential to generate an unseen per-\nformance, not merely to analyze an already known one.\nIn the following sections, we propose a method for the\nautomatic analysis of the characteristics of a performance\nbased on various combinations of expressive representations.\nAlso, we observe what kinds of representation constitute the\nhuman quality of the performance by apply them to the data\nmeasured from the real performance to evaluate the validity\nof this method.\n2. METHOD\nIn this section, we propose a method for the automatic clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation of trends of the deviations in performance, so as to\ndescribe the dependencies between score and performance.\nOn the keyboard instrument, a performer‚Äôs key operation,\nin terms of timing and intensity, causes deviations from the\nscore for the purpose of artistic expression. We believe that\nthe performer‚Äôs individuality would occur in the differences\nin the trend of deviations. The occurrence tendencies of\nthese deviations in the performance are not constant, as they\nare affected by various factors such as the differences in mu-\nsical compositions. To capture the characteristics of indi-\nviduals who performed only in terms of deviation from the\naverage trend in the overall performance is difÔ¨Åcult; there-\nfore, it is necessary to handle deviations in each key action,\nspeciÔ¨Åcally and in general. Using this awareness, we have\nbeen studying a method that regards the trends in the de-\nviation as a stochastic model and acquire these trends via\nlearning and instructions on the score.\n531Poster Session 4\nartistic-deviations \nextract amount of\ndeviations for each \ndeviational factor score\nreferred by \nthe performer samples \nmeasured from \nthe performance \n-1/2 -1/4 just 1/4 1/2onset\nbeat-1/2 -1/4 just 1/4 1/2oÔ¨Äset\nbeat\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2gate time \nra/g415o\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2dynamics \nra/g415o0 0.5 1 1.5 2tempo\nra/g415ofrequency Figure 1 .

Extraction of contextual factors\n2.1 Context-dependent model\nIf the performance seems to be personalized, it is considered\nthat the resultant personality is caused by biases in the trends\nof performance. The trend of deviation is observed as a dis-\ntribution with some focus, according to deviations for each\nnote extracted from each note oobserved from the measured\nperformance and the corresponding score (see Figure 1). We\ncan think of the model as a Gaussian probability density\nfunction (PDF) so as to approximate the behavior of devi-\nations; this model is able to cope with complex behaviors\naccording to the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach.\nThe PDF Nof the observation vector ois deÔ¨Åned by\nN(om|¬µm,œÉm)\n=1‚àö\n(2œÄ)DŒ†D\nd=1|œÉmd|exp(\n‚àí1\n2D‚àë\nd=1(od‚àí¬µmd)2\nœÉmd)\n,\n(1)\nwhere ois observed with Ddeviational factors, odis the\ndth dimension for observation vector o,mis the mixture in-\ndex of the MGaussian component densities, ¬µis the mean\nvector, and œÉis the diagonal covariance matrix.\nHowever, the cause of the deviating behavior is not con-\nsidered in this model. The performance of musical instru-\nments consists of playing the sequences of notes according\nto the score. Therefore, it is obvious that the qualities of\neach note have some musical signiÔ¨Åcance. As a general ex-\nample, we consider performing two notes with different rep-\nresentations in terms of dynamics. In this case, the amount\nof deviation between them may be differ not only in the dy-\nnamics, but also in the timing, because of their expressive\nrepresentations. Also, the extent to which the performer de-\nviates from the average for the note with the representation\nis considered to be under the inÔ¨Çuence of some individual-\nity. In the past, there were several studies that attempted to\nestimate the performers‚Äô characteristics by referring to the\namount of deviation in timing and dynamics [5‚Äì7]. How-\never, it is also necessary to consider what kind of representa-\ntion leads to such behavior, using some musical knowledge\nthat supersedes the mixture in the GMM.\nSeveral factors complicate the process of occurrence. We\nmake the following considerations to organize this subject:‚Ä¢The performer obtains information from the musical\nscore, and then creates his/her own interpretation us-\ning that information, thus introducing deviations into\nthe performance.\n‚Ä¢The trend of deviations occurring is also inÔ¨Çuenced by\nunintentional factors such as the performer‚Äôs physical\nlimitations.\nWe believe that the latter factor is not necessary, because it is\nconsidered likely based on relatively simple arguments, and\nthe progress of performance technology is a means to reduce\nthe interference of factors, such as unintentional representa-\ntions. Additionally, factors (such as the former) inÔ¨Çuence\nthe occurrence of this deviation, which is considered signif-\nicant because it is intended to expand the range of expres-\nsion in accordance with technological progress. However,\ncriteria tend to be abstract and difÔ¨Åcult to qualify, even for\nthe performers themselves. Therefore, we do not directly\naddress the interpretation of the music itself. Instead, we\nassociate the trends in the deviation with the expressive rep-\nresentations, which affects the performer‚Äôs musical interpre-\ntation.\nAll the information used here is in the form of unambigu-\nous values that are available in the score, such as pitch, note\nvalue, dynamics, and so on, because we want to eliminate\nany undeÔ¨Åned properties throughout the process. There is\nalso the musical phrase to consider, which has some rela-\ntionship that holds among surrounding notes. We introduce\nthem under the term ‚Äùcontext.‚Äù Models in which context is\napplied are called ‚Äùcontext-dependent,‚Äù because they con-\nstruct a kind of context that contributes to the interpretation.\nThe parameters of the model are the same as the model men-\ntioned above; however, each model has its own combination\nof contexts that is dealt with individually (see Figure 2). The\ndescription of the behavior for each model can be simpliÔ¨Åed\nbecause it is deÔ¨Åned by a number of combinations. There-\nfore, each model is trained using a single Gaussian compo-\nnent density, as shown in Equation (1) .\n2.2 Tree-based clustering\nThe purpose of introducing context is to associate a per-\nformer‚Äôs interpretation of the musical composition with the\ndeviations in the performance.

Example of a decision tree\nsider a variety of contexts. However, with increasing use of\ncontexts, the quantity of combinations of contexts increases\nexponentially. This effect is detrimental to model training,\nbecause the training data for each model will be signiÔ¨Åcantly\nreduced. On the other hand, fragmented information has lit-\ntle meaning by itself. Therefore, it is necessary to classify\na large number of combinations of contexts at a scale that\nmatches the performer‚Äôs signiÔ¨Åcant interpretation. How-\never, it is beyond human power to decide appropriate cri-\nteria for each case of classiÔ¨Åcation. To address these issues,\na method is necessary to reconstruct and decompose models\nefÔ¨Åciently, and to capture the varied expressive representa-\ntions obtained from the score. We use tree-based cluster-\ning [4] to classify the context-dependent models.\nTree-based clustering divides all possible combinations\nof context-dependent model into a countable number of clus-\nters. As a result, a decision tree (a binary tree in which\na question is attached to each node) is obtained. In this\nmethod, each of the questions relates to the contextual fac-\ntors for the preceding, current, and succeeding note. One\ntree is constructed for each deviational factor so as to cluster\nall of the corresponding behaviors of all context-dependent\nmodels. This is done because there are different trends of\nbehavior for each deviational factor. All context-dependent\nmodels in the decision tree are divided into Mnodes by\nclusters S1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, SM, such that one model U(S1,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑, SM)\nis deÔ¨Åned for each leaf node. For example, the tree shown in\nFigure 3 will partition its behaviors into eight subsets with\nthe same number of leaf nodes. The questions and topology\nof the tree are chosen so as to maximize the likelihood of the\ntraining data, given these tied behaviors, by estimating the\nparameters of a Gaussian PDF. Once these trees have been\nconstructed, data with unseen contexts can be classiÔ¨Åed in\nany leaf node by tracing the questions in the tree.\nInitially, all the context-dependent models to be clustered\nare placed at the root node of the tree. The log likelihood\nof the training data is calculated, supposing that all of the\nmodels in that node are tied. Then, this node is divided into\ntwo by Ô¨Ånding a question that divides the model in the par-\nent node such that the log likelihood (maximally) increases.The log likelihood Lfor node Smis given by\nL(Sm) =‚àí1\n2Œìm(K+Klog(2œÄ)Llog|Œ£m|),(2)\nwhere Œìmis the amount of data for training at node Sm.\nThis process is then repeated by dividing the node in a way\nthat creates the maximum increase of log likelihood until\nthe minimum description length (MDL) criterion [9] is met.\nThis step is carried out to optimize the number of clusters\nwithout using external control parameters. In order to opti-\nmize the size of the tree, we use an algorithm with a prag-\nmatic cost of computation. Here, let us assume that node\nSmof model Udivides into two nodes, Smq+andSmq‚àí,\nby answering question q. Then, let ‚àÜm(q)be the difference\nbetween the description length after division and before di-\nvision, that is l(U/prime)‚àíl(U). The description length of model\nU/primeis represented by the following equation:\nI(U/prime) =M‚àë\nm/prime=1,/negationslash=m1\n2Œìm/prime(K+Klog(2œÄ) + log |Œ£m/prime|)\n+1\n2Œìmq+(K+Klog(2œÄ) + log |Œ£mq+|)\n+1\n2Œìmq‚àí(K+Klog(2œÄ) + log |Œ£mq‚àí|)\n+K(M+ 1) log W+C, (3)\nwhere W=‚àëM\nm=1Œìm, and Cis the length of code re-\nquired to choose a model (assumed here to be a constant\nvalue). The number of nodes in U/primeisM+ 1,Œìmq+is the\noccupancy count for node Smq+, and Œìmq‚àíis that of node\nSmq‚àí. The difference ‚àÜm(q)is given by\n‚àÜm(q) =l(U/prime)‚àíl(U)\n=1\n2(Œìmq+log|Œ£mq+|+ Œìmq‚àílog|Œ£mq‚àí|\n‚àíŒìmlog|Œ£m|) +KlogM‚àë\nm=1Œìm.(4)\nWhen dividing models, we Ô¨Årst determine the question\nq/primethat minimizes ‚àÜ0q/primeand that is used at root node S0.\nIf‚àÜ0(q/prime)<0, node S0is divided into two nodes, Sq+\nandSq‚àí, and the same procedure is repeated for each of\nthese two nodes. This process of dividing nodes is car-\nried out until there are no nodes remaining to be divided.\nIf‚àÜ0(q/prime)>0, then no dividing is executed.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we apply the method mentioned above to\nthe real-measured performance data to verify its efÔ¨Åcacy of\nusing expressive representations from the musical score as\npriori information. This information is applied to the issue\nof classifying the trends of the deviational behavior during\nthe musical performance.\n533Poster Session 4\n3.1 Data of real-measured expressive performance\nExperiments in this paper use expressive performance data\nfrom a database ( [1] and original data we collected). These\ncontain information of musical expression on experts‚Äô ex-\npressive piano solo performances of classical Western mu-\nsical compositions. The data of performance used in the\nexperiments are as follows:\n‚Ä¢performers\nPAV. D. Ashkenazy\nPGG. H. Gould\nPPM. J. Pires\nPRS. T.

The current form of our method excludes\nthese notes from the data used to train the model.\n3.2 Design of models\nThe values of deviations and contexts are extracted by com-\nparing the performance and the score, as shown in Figure 1\nand Figure 2. The Ô¨Åve factors in which there could be devi-\nation (shown below) are extracted for each note; therefore,\nthe dimensionality D= 5in Equation (1).\n‚Ä¢Factors that depend on the note:\nonset Timing when striking the key. The amount of\ndeviation is represented relative to a beat. If the\nperformed note is struck one half beat faster, the\ndeviation of onset is ‚àí0.5.\noffset Timing when releasing the key, represented in\nthe same way as the deviation of onset.\ngate time The quotient of the time taken to depress\nthe key in the performance divided by its length\non the score. If both are exactly the same, the\ndeviation of gate time is 1.\ndynamics Strength when striking the key, obtained\nin the same way as the deviation of gate time.\n‚Ä¢Factor that depends on the beat:\ntempo Temporal change of BPM (current beat/average).\nThe contextual factors attached to context-dependent model\nare shown below. They are used for question to construct\ndecision trees. In this experiment, the total number of ques-\ntions used amounted to more than two thousands.‚Ä¢Extracted for {preceding, current, succeeding }notes:\nsyllable Interval name of the note and the tonic, i.e.,\nminor third, perfect Ô¨Åfth, etc.\nstep One of the twelve note names, from C to B.\naccidental Existence and type of accidental.\noctave Rough pitch of the note.\nchord Whether the note belongs to any chord.\ntype Note value of the note.\nstaff Clef and stage on the great staff the note is writ-\nten in.\nbeam Type of the note‚Äôs beams, i.e., begin, continue,\nend, etc.\nlocal The note‚Äôs position on the beat in the bar, rep-\nresented as a percentage.\n‚Ä¢Extracted for current note only:\nglobal The note‚Äôs position in elapsed time in the mu-\nsical composition, represented as a percentage.\nvoice Voice part of the note, deÔ¨Åned by the author of\nthe database.\nnotations Noted signs for the note, such as dynam-\nics, intonation, etc.\n3.3 EfÔ¨Åcacy of tree-based clustering\nThe tree-based clustering itself is an existing method; how-\never, the effect of applying this method to a musical per-\nformance is unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to deter-\nmine whether changes in generative efÔ¨Åciency can be seen\nin the bottom-up clustered model without additional infor-\nmation. To achieve concrete results, we tried to identify the\nperformer from the performance data using the models. The\ndata sets used in this case were SBI and SM3, both of which\nwere performed by PX. The models were trained with the\ndata of the compositions, which amounted to approximately\none quarter of the data set. The tests used each datum of the\nremaining compositions in the same set; the percentage of\nthe right choices for the performer by the trained model was\ncalculated (called the rate of identiÔ¨Åcation). Evaluation of\nresistance to the unseen data was also carried out using this\ntest, as all models were tested with data that is not used to\ntrain the models. We differentiate these methods:\nTree-based clustering The model using the proposed method.\nBottom-up clustering The model trained by GMM with\nthe same number of mixtures Mas the leaves in the\ntrees generated by tree-based clustering, and using the\nsame data set that is used to train the models.\nThe result is shown in Figure 4, and the ratio of accu-\nracy to the average of 20 ordinary human listeners for each\nmethod is also indicated in parentheses. This is a severe con-\ndition, and the most human listeners cannot tell the differ-\nence. However, proposed method can determine such subtle\ndifference with high precision, because the ratio of Tree-\nbased is about 232% for human listeners. Furthermore, the\nratio of Tree-based forBottom-up is about 111%. There-\nfore, it is conÔ¨Årmed that the accuracy can be improved upon\nto generate models that can respond to unseen data by using\nthe clustering with the information from the score.\n53412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n9.399e-02\n2.693e-01 2.668e-025.980e-01 -6.722e-02Is type of currentNote\n shorter than doubleDottedEighth?\nIs voice of currentNote\n 5?yes\nIs octave of succeedingNote\n higher than 1?no\nno\n150\nIs beam of succeedingNote\n begin?yes\nno\n62yes\n24no\n4yes\n74(b)offset for SCN by PA\n1.430e+00 4.232e-01\n1.325e+00 2.568e+00 1.302e+00 1.005e+00Is voice of currentNote\n 5?\nIs octave of succeedingNote\n higher than 3?yes\nIs type of currentNote\n shorter than Whole?no\nno\n60\nIs global of currentNote\n earlier than 3%?yesno\n36\nIs type of currentNote\n longer than Eighth?yes\nno\n13yes\n14no\n144yes\n47 (c)gate time for SCN by PA\n-5.183e-02\n1.390e-03\n5.174e-03 -3.092e-02Is type of currentNote\n shorter than doubleDottedQuarter?\nno\n43\nIs octave of currentNote\n 3?yes\nno\n166\nIs beam of currentNote\n end?yes\nno\n62yes\n43\n(a)onset for SCN by PA\n3.075e-01 2.669e-01 3.341e-01\n3.894e-01 4.521e-01Is staff of succeedingNote\n 1G2?\nIs voice of currentNote\n 4?no\nIs type of succeedingNote\n shorter than DottedQuarter?yes\nno\n90yes\n106no\n29\nIs octave of currentNote\n 5?yes\nno\n40yes\n49 (d)dynamics for SCN by PA\n1.053e+00\n8.427e-01\n9.314e-01 1.128e+00Is local of currentNote\n later than 20%?\nyes\n172\nIs local of succeedingNote\n later than 5%?no\nno\n64\nIs local of precedingNote\n later than 71%?yes\nno\n63yes\n15 (e)tempo for SCN by PA\nFigure 5 .

Results of identiÔ¨Åcation test\n3.4 Observation of decision trees\nNext, we observe the decision trees obtained from the per-\nformance data to verify the kind of questions that divide the\nmodels and the statistical attributes of each model. The set\nof training data used here was SCN, performed by PA. Ex-\namples of the portion of the trees near the root are shown in\nFigure 5. Each node has the content of the question, each\nleaf gives the average deviation, and the number of models\ninvolved in each leaf is indicated by an arrow.\nThe trees of deviational factors belong to the timing ( on-\nset,offset , and gate time ) have afÔ¨Ånities in the kind of ques-\ntions. The tree of dynamics also has the sequence of ques-\ntions with the same contexts as the factors mentioned above;\nhowever, the kind of question on the root node is not seen.\nAlthough they have certain unique points, they have a simi-\nlar structure. On the other hand, the tree of tempo has very\ndifferent trends, both in terms of structure and questions.3.5 Contribution of contextual factors to decision trees\nDue to the limitations of the available data, a more efÔ¨Åcient\nanalysis is needed to understand the trends of these fac-\ntors. We therefore investigated the frequency of any ques-\ntion to Ô¨Ånd the degree of contribution to the trend of de-\nviation caused by each contextual factor. The contribution\nCfor contextual factor Qin a tree with Mleaf nodes is\ncounted by\nCQ=M‚àë\nm=1(Nm\nNall√óRQ)\n, (5)\nwhere Nmis the number of context-dependent models shared\nby the mth leaf node, and Ris the number of nodes related\ntoQin the path from the root node to the mth leaf node. The\ntraining data used here was SBW-by- {PG, and PR }, SCN-\nby-{PA, and PP }, and SM5-by- {PG, and PP }. The results\nfor each composition are shown in Figure 6; we propose that\nthese results show the priorities of performers‚Äô criterion to\ndifferentiate the behavior in the performance.\nThe trend of contextual factors that make a large contri-\nbution is the same in all compositions (e.g., step,octave ,\ntype,local , and syllable ). We consider the essential part of\nthe trees‚Äô construction to depend upon the selection order\nof these factors. On the other hand, the difference between\noffset and gate time is small, as mentioned above; however,\nthese result shows some differences (for example, they are\nfound in step,octave , and type). There is a possibility to\nreveal the diverging points of the deviations with expressive\nrepresentations by observing more detailed classiÔ¨Åcations.\n535Poster Session 4\n0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 onset oÔ¨Äset gate /g415me dynamics tempo average\ncontextual factor rate of frequency [%] (a) average of performances for SBW by PG and PR\n0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 onset oÔ¨Äset gate /g415me dynamics tempo average \ncontextual factor rate of frequency [%] \n(b) average of performances for SCN by PA and PP\n0510 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 onset oÔ¨Äset gate /g415me dynamics tempo average\ncontextual factor rate of frequency [%] \n(c) average of performances for SM5 by PG and PP\nFigure 6 .Frequencies of contextual factors for each composition\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we presented a method for describing the char-\nacteristics of human musical performance. The experimen-\ntal results of performer identiÔ¨Åcation showed the use of the\nexpressive representations from the musical score enables\nthe efÔ¨Åcient acquisition of the model of the performance.\nThe results also showed that the proposed model can cap-\nture the characteristics of the performance from any subtle\ndifferences that cannot be found by most human listeners.\nTherefore, the efÔ¨Åcacy of using expressive representations\nfrom the musical score to describe the characteristics of the\nmusical performance was shown. This method can auto-\nmatically learn the knowledge necessary to describe the tree\nstructure of the model directly from the data of the perfor-mance. We believe that the availability of such objective\nelements from the proposed model is effective for the anal-\nysis of the performance. In the future, we will make compar-\nisons based on more common and more extensive examples,\nin addition to attempting to improve the modeling method.\nFurthermore, this method can be applied to generate unseen\nperformances. We are also making efforts in that direction.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nThe increasing availability of digital music accessible by\nend users is boosting the development of Music Informa-\ntion Retrieval (MIR), a research area devoted to the study\nof methodologies for content- and context-based music ac-\ncess. As it appears from the scientiÔ¨Åc production of the last\ndecades, research on MIR encompasses a wide variety of\ndifferent subjects that go beyond pure retrieval: the deÔ¨Åni-\ntion of novel content descriptors and multidimensional sim-\nilarity measures to generate playlists; the extraction of high\nlevel descriptors ‚Äì e.g. melody, harmony, rhythm, struc-\nture ‚Äì from audio; the automatic identiÔ¨Åcation of artist and\ngenre. As it is well known, the possibility to evaluate the\ndifferent research results using a shared dataset has always\nplayed a central role in the development of information re-\ntrieval methodologies, as it is witnessed by the success of\ninitiatives such as TREC and CLEF, which focus on textual\ndocuments.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.The same need has been perceived in MIR, motivating the\ndevelopment of an important evaluation campaign, the Mu-\nsic Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX).\nMIREX campaigns1are organized since 2005 [4] by the In-\nternational Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation\nLaboratory (IMIRSEL) at the Graduate School of Library\nand Information Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign. Due to the many limitations posed by the mu-\nsic industry, the organizers of the MIREX chose to distribute\nonly publicly available test collections. Participants are in\ncharge to create their own collection and after local experi-\nmentation submit their software that is run by the organizers.\nThis approach has two drawbacks, which have already been\ndebated by the MIR research community: the results of pre-\nvious campaigns cannot be easily replicated and the results\ndepend on the individual training sets and not only on the\nsubmitted algorithms.\nA recent relevant initiative, that aims at overcoming the\nlimitations imposed by not sharing the datasets between re-\nsearchers, is the Million Songs Dataset (MSD). Thanks to\nMSD2, researchers can access a number of features from a\nvery large collection of songs [2]. Unfortunately, the algo-\nrithms used to extract these features are not public, limiting\nthe possibility to carry out research on content description\ntechniques. Another ongoing initiative related to the eval-\nuation of MIR approaches is the Networked Environment\nfor Music Analysis (NEMA), that aims at providing a web-\nbased architecture for the integration of music data and an-\nalytic/evaluative tools3. NEMA builds upon the achieve-\nments of MIREX campaigns regarding the evaluation of MIR\napproaches, with the additional goal of providing tools for\nresource discovery and sharing.\nWithin this scenario, MusiCLEF is an additional bench-\nmarking initiative, that has been proposed in 2011 as part\nof the activities of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum\n(CLEF). CLEF focuses on multilingual and multimodal re-\ntrieval4and gathers researchers in different aspect of in-\nformation retrieval, ranging from plagiarism and intellectual\nproperty rights to image retrieval.\nThe goal of MusiCLEF is to promote the development of\n1http://www.music-ir.org/mirex\n2http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/\n3http://www.music-ir.org/?q=nema/overview\n4http://clef-campaign.org/\n603Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nnovel methodologies for music access and retrieval, which\ncan combine content-based information, automatically ex-\ntracted from music Ô¨Åles, with contextual information, pro-\nvided by users through tags, comments, or reviews. The\ncombination of these two sources of information is still under-\ninvestigated in MIR, although it is well known that content-\nbased information alone is not able to capture all the relevant\nfeatures of a given music piece (for instance, its usage as a\nsoundtrack or the year of release), while contextual informa-\ntion suffers from the typical limitations for new items and\nnew users (also known as cold start).\nAiming at investigating and promoting research on the\ncombination of textual and music information, MusiCLEF\nhas a strong focus on multimodality that, together with mul-\ntilingualism, is the main objective of the CLEF evaluation\nforum. Moreover, the tasks proposed for MusiCLEF 2011\nare motivated by real scenarios, discussed with private and\npublic bodies involved in music access and dissemination. In\nparticular, MIR techniques can be exploited for helping mu-\nsic professionals to describe music collections and for man-\naging a music digital library of digitized analogue record-\nings. To this end, the organizers of MusiCLEF exploited\nthe ongoing collaborations with both a company for music\nbroadcasting services (LaCosa s.r.l.) and a public music li-\nbrary (University of Alicante‚Äôs Fonoteca).\nTwo tasks are proposed within MusiCLEF 2011, and both\nare based on a test collection of thousands of songs in MP3\nformat. To completely overcome copyright issues, only low-\nlevel descriptors will be distributed to participants. Figure 1\ndepicts the tasks workÔ¨Çow of MusiCLEF, which is described\nin more detail in the following sections.\nMusicCLEFnot public\nMusicCLEFpublic web site\n                      Participant                participant pc    .         \nlast.fmwebservice\nMP3 Library\nLow level features\nif(conn  SELEC  WHERE  print   features extractor\n1.read\n<script var a= var xl if(xlsParticipant algorithms\nLow level featurestags\nif(conn  SELEC  WHERE  print   last.fm data\n3. download\n4. read\nresultsResults evaluation\nCampaignParticipant Results\nif(conn  SELEC  WHERE  print   last.fm data\n4. read\n5. produce\n2. produce\n1. http request\n7. publish\n6. submit\nFigure 1 :Task workÔ¨Çow in MusiCLEF.\nIt is important to note that, although the audio Ô¨Åles can-\nnot be distributed, the goal of MusiCLEF is to grant the par-\nticipants with complete access to music features of the test\ncollection. This means that the algorithms used to extractthe music descriptors are public ‚Äì and in particular are based\non the set of tools provided by the MIRToolbox ‚Äì but also\nthat participants can submit their own original algorithm for\nfeature extraction, that will be run locally. Therefore, Musi-\nCLEF goals are to Ô¨Åll the gap between the other important\ninitiatives in MIR evaluation: researchers can test and com-\npare their approaches using a shared number of tasks, as in\nMIREX, while accessing a shared collection of content de-\nscriptors, as in MSD.\n2. APPLICATION SCENARIOS\nAs mentioned in the previous section, a major goal of Musi-\nCLEF is to maintain a tight connection with real application\nscenarios, in order to promote the development of techniques\nthat can be applied to solve issues in music accessing and re-\ntrieval that are faced by professional users. The choice of fo-\ncusing on professional users is motivated by the fact that they\nneed to address a number of real-life issues that are usually\nnot taken into account by music accessing systems aimed at\nthe general public. At the same time, the evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the proposed automatic solution is easier to\nassess, because professional users have a clear idea of what\nare their information needs.\nIn the following we present the two professional partners\nof MusiCLEF, and we also describe the motivations that in-\nduced us to organize the two tasks mentioned in the previous\nsection.\n2.1 LaCosa s.r.l.\nLaCosa was founded as a service provider of the major TV\nbroadcasting ‚Äì public and private ‚Äì companies in Italy with\nthe goal of managing and describing a large music collec-\ntion of songs to be used for TV programs, including jingles,\nbackground and incidental music, and music themes for TV\nshows. LaCosa has a strong cooperation with RTI, a com-\npany that, apart from buying and storing songs issued by\nthe major record companies, produces its own music cata-\nlogue. At present, RTI library contains about 320,000 songs\nof pop-rock, jazz, and classical music. Besides playing the\nrole of music consultant, being one of the biggest private\nmusic repositories in Italy, RTI offers a number of services\nto external companies of music consultants, who can browse\nremotely the repository. Audio features distributed to the\nparticipants are thus extracted remotely, without download-\ning the audio Ô¨Åles.\nThe typical job of a music consultant is to select a list\nof songs that are suitable for a particular application, for in-\nstance a TV commercial, the ‚Äúpromo‚Äù of a new program,\nthe background music for a documentary, and so on. The\navailability of large online collections, such as Last.fm and\nYouTube, is representing an alternative to the services of a\nmusic consultant. For instance, journalists are increasingly\nselecting by themselves the music for their news stories, in-\nstead of asking to music consultants. The goal of LaCosa is\n60412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nthen to provide high quality descriptions, that are tailored to\nthe particular application domain, in order to represent still\na more interesting alternative to free recommendations.\nGiven these considerations, the requirements of LaCosa\ncan be summarized as follows: How to improve the acqui-\nsition process, extracting the maximum amount of informa-\ntion about music recordings from external resources? How\nto provide good suggestion about possible usages of music\nmaterial, minimizing the amount of manual work?\nBecause of the interest on the development of automatic\nsystems for addressing these two requirements, LaCosa de-\ncided to provide at its own expenses a number of assessors\nto create the ground truth for evaluation. The involvement\nof professional users included also the deÔ¨Ånition of a vocab-\nulary of 167 terms describing music genre (terms are orga-\nnized in two levels, genre and subgenre), and of 188 terms\ndescribing the music mood. It is important to note that, in\nthis case, the concept of mood is related to the usage of a\nparticular song within a video production. As explained in\nmore detail in Section 3, only a subset of the mood tags have\nbeen used in the evaluation campaign.\n2.2 University of Alicante‚Äôs Fonoteca\nSome years ago, the local radio broadcast station Radio Al-\nicante Cadena Ser transferred its collection of vinyls to the\nLibrary of the University of Alicante. This collection con-\ntains approximately 40,000 vinyls of an important cultural\nvalue, containing a wide range of genres. The library de-\ncided to digitize the vinyls, sound and covers, to overcome\nthe preservation problems when allowing library users to ac-\ncess the discs and to enable its reproduction embedded in\nthe library‚Äôs Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) with the\nname Fonoteca5.\nThe process was carried out following library cataloguing\ntechniques to make the inventory of the collection. Vinyls\nwere catalogued using Universal Decimal ClassiÔ¨Åcation, and\nclassiÔ¨Åed into subjects based on the Library of Congress sub-\nject headings. Digitized covers and audio were linked to\nthe corresponding records. The cataloguing data consists of\nthe album‚Äôs title, the name of the discographic company, the\nrelease year, its physic description, several entries for gen-\nres classiÔ¨Åed manually by the cataloguers, and Ô¨Ånally notes\nabout the content. Regarding the sound content, each vinyl\nwas digitized in two Ô¨Åles, one for each side. For 45 rpm\ndiscs each side usually contains only one song, while for 33\nrpm LPs, which are more common in the collection, each\nside contains several tracks.\nHaving catalogued and digitized the material, some draw-\nbacks emerge that strongly limit the browsing capabilities\nin the OPAC. The separation of tracks from a continuous\nstream could be easily solved in most cases just by Ô¨Ånding\nsilences between tracks. However, this may not be the case\nfor live recordings or classical music tracks, where the mu-\nsic itself contains long rests. A related problem is the correct\n5http://www.ua.es/en/bibliotecas/SIBID/fonotecaentitling of the tracks. Although some catalogued albums\ncontain details of the contained tracks, there are many oth-\ners, mainly operas, where the track names are not present.\nAnother common situation is that of Ô¨Ånding two different\nrecordings of the same work whose tracks have been la-\nbeled using two different languages or naming schemes, e.g.,\n‚ÄúSymphony No. 9‚Äù knowns as ‚ÄúNovena Sinfon ¬¥ƒ±a‚Äù as well as\n‚ÄúChoral Symphony‚Äù. Audio Ô¨Ångerprinting techniques can\nhardly be applied to solve this task because of disc age, be-\nsides the fact that some of the discs may not have been reis-\nsued on CD and thus may not have been included in any\naudio Ô¨Ångerprint dataset.\nBesides these drawbacks, the staff of the library demands\nsome features that cannot be implemented given the current\nstructure of the data. For example, given an album, Ô¨Ånd it\nin music sites like Last.fm orGrooveshark . Similarly, Ô¨Ånd a\ngiven song/track and its different recordings in those music\nsites and inside the library regardless of language or naming\nschemes. In order to locate music, they want the users to be\nable to query the library given metadata not contained in the\ncatalog, like the lyrics of the songs.\n3. CATEGORIZATION OF POP/ROCK MUSIC\nThe goal of the Ô¨Årst task is to exploit both automatically\nextracted information about the content and user generated\ninformation about the context to carry out categorization.\nThe task is based on a real application scenario: songs of\na ‚Äúcommercial music library‚Äù need to be categorized ac-\ncording to their possible usage in TV and radio broadcasts\nor Web streaming (commercials, soundtracks, jingles). Ac-\ncording to experts in the Ô¨Åeld, it is common practice to use\ndifferent sources of information to assess the relevance of a\ngiven song to a particular usage. At Ô¨Årst candidate songs are\nselected depending on the result of Web searches and on the\nanalysis of user-generated tags. Since these sources of infor-\nmation are usually very noisy, experts make the Ô¨Ånal choice\ndepending on the actual music content.\nIn order to simulate this scenario, participants of Musi-\nCLEF are provided with three different sources of informa-\ntion: content descriptors, user tags, and related Web pages.\nSince CLEF campaigns aim at promoting multilingualism,\ntags and Web pages are in different languages. It was not\nmandatory, at least for MusiCLEF 2011, neither to use all\nthe different languages nor to exploit all the source of infor-\nmation. In general, participants are free to select the descrip-\ntors that better Ô¨Åt the approach they want to test. To this end,\nthe possibility of creating a baseline of individual sources of\ninformation is considered of interest for future MusiCLEF\ncampaigns.\nThe dataset made available to participants includes mostly\nsongs of pop and rock genres, which are the more often used\nin TV broadcasts. As mentioned in Section 2.1 a number of\nmusic professionals from LaCosa s.r.l. provided the catego-\nrization for the complete dataset of 1355 songs, which has\nbeen divided in a training set of 975 song and test set of the\n605Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nremaining 380 songs. Being the Ô¨Årst year, the ground truth\nis available for a limited number of songs but it is envisaged\nthat the continuation of MusiCLEF over the years will create\na shared background for evaluation.\nThe participants were asked to assign to each song in the\ntest set the correct tags. Results were evaluated against the\nground truth.\n3.1 DeÔ¨Ånition of the Dataset\nThe task of music categorization can be considered an auto-\ntagging task, that is the automatic assignment of relevant de-\nscriptive semantic words to a set of songs. In the literature,\nseveral scalable approaches have been proposed for labeling\nmusic with semantics including social tagging, Web mining,\ntag propagation from similar songs, and content-based au-\ntomatic strategies [3]. Regardless of the approach used, the\noutput of a tagging system is generally a vector of tag scores,\nwhich measures the strength of the relationships tag-song for\neach tag of a semantic vocabulary (i.e. semantic weights ).\nThe dataset built to carry out the auto-tagging evaluation\ncampaign is composed of 1355 different songs, played by\n218 different artists; each song has a duration between 2 and\n6 minutes. One of the goals of the task is to have participants\nthat may exploit, beyond content-based audio features, also\nother music descriptors (e.g. social and Web mined tags).\nFor this reason we built the dataset using only well-known\nartists; this allowed us to gather a big amount of Web-based\ndescriptors (i.e. the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù) for most of the\nsongs in the dataset. We collected the songs starting from\nthe ‚ÄúRolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time‚Äù list6,\nwhich was the cover story of a special issue of Rolling Stone\n(no. 963 of December 9 2004 ‚Äì updated in May 2010). The\nsong list was chosen based on votes by 172 musicians, crit-\nics, and music-industry professionals, and is almost entirely\ncomposed of English-speaking artists. Table 1 reports the\ntop 10 positions of this rank list.\nStarting from this list, we considered all the different artists\nas seeds to query a larger music database for gathering all the\nsongs associated to every artist, excluding live versions that\nare usually of little interest for TV broadcasts. From this\npool we randomly retained at most 8 songs per-artist, in or-\nder to fairly uniformly distribute songs between the different\nartist. As result, we had 161 artists associated with about 8\nsongs in the Ô¨Ånal collection.\nEach song in the dataset has been manually annotated by\nmusic professionals from LaCosa. The vocabulary of tags\ndeÔ¨Åned by the experts was initially composed of 355 tags\ndivided in two categories ‚Äì genre (167) and usage (288) ‚Äì\nloosely inspired by the Music Genome Project7.\nAfter that, all the songs have been tagged by the human\nexperts with at least one tag for genre and Ô¨Åve tags for mood.\nAt the end, we discarded all the tags that were assigned to\n6http://www.metrolyrics.com/rs/ (as in May 2011)\n7http://www.pandora.comRank Title Artist\n1 Like a rolling stone Bob Dylan\n2 (I can‚Äôt get no) Satisfaction Rolling Stones\n3 Imagine John Lennon\n4 What‚Äôs going on Marvin Gaye\n5 Respect Aretha Franklin\n6 Good Vibrations Beach Boys\n7 Johnny B.

In particular,\nwe precomputed timbre descriptors (Mel-Frequency Cep-\nstral CoefÔ¨Åcients) that are directly available to participants.\nFeature sets have been computed using the MIRToolbox [7]\nalgorithms, which are publicly available. Moreover, partici-\npants can request the extraction of additional descriptors. In\norder to let participants perform their own feature extraction,\nwe plan to make available also more general features in fu-\nture years. In particular, we plan to provide the output of\nthe triangular Ô¨Ålterbanks before computing the log and the\ncosine transform of MFCCs. The rhythm based descriptors\nprovided by the MIRToolbox will be precomputed as well.\nWe also provide social tags gathered from Last.fm as avail-\nable on May 2011. For each song of the corpus, we used\nthe Last.fm audio Ô¨Ångerprint service8and public data shar-\ning AudioScrobbler website9to associate our music Ô¨Åles to\ntheir songs and collect social tags for each song. Therefore,\nwe release the list of social tags together with their associ-\nated score.\nCategory Tags\nGenrebossanova, country rock, hymn, orches-\ntral pop, slide blues\nMoodalarm, awards, danger, glamour, mili-\ntary, scary, trance\nTable 2 :A sample of the tags proposed to the music professionals\nfor annotating the songs of the auto-tagging dataset.\n8http://blog.last.fm/2010/07/09/\nfingerprint-api-and-app-updated /\n9http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/\n60612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3.3 Web-mining\nWeb pages covering music-related topics have been used\nsuccessfully as data source for various MIR tasks, in partic-\nular, for information extraction (e.g., band membership [5],\nartist recommendation [1], and similarity measurement [6,\n8]. The text-based features extracted from such Web pages\nare often referred to as cultural or community metadata since\nthey typically capture the knowledge or opinions of a large\nnumber of people or institutions. They therefore represent a\nkind of contextual data.\nWe Ô¨Årst queried Google to retrieve up to 100 URLs for\neach artist in the collection. Subsequently, we fetch the Web\ncontent available at these URLs. Since usually the resulting\npages typically contain a lot of unrelated documents, we al-\nleviate this issue by adding further keywords to the search\nquery, with an approach similar to [8]. We crawled various\nsets of Web pages in six different languages ‚Äì English, Ger-\nman, Swedish, French, Italian, and Spanish ‚Äì employing the\nfollowing query scheme:\n\"artist name\" (+music|+musik|+musique|+musica)\nFor MusiCLEF a total of 127,133pages have been fetched.\nThe resulting information enables participants who would\nlike to make use of structural information to derive corre-\nsponding features from the raw Web pages. In addition to\nthese sets of Web pages, we provide precomputed term weight\nvectors. Taking into account the Ô¨Åndings of a large scale\nstudy on modeling term weight vectors from artist-related\nWeb pages [6], we Ô¨Årst describe each artist as a virtual doc-\nument, which is the concatenation of the HTML documents\nretrieved for the artist. We then compute per virtual artist\ndocument the term frequencies (tf) in absolute numbers.\nFurther providing the inverse document frequency (id f) scores\nfor the Web page set of each language will allow participants\nto easily build a simple t f¬∑id frepresentation or apply more\nelaborate information fusion techniques. In summary, for\nthe term vector representation of the dataset, we offer the\nfollowing pieces of information:\n‚Ä¢t fweights per virtual document of each artist\n‚Ä¢global id fscores for each language\n‚Ä¢corresponding lists of terms for each language\nThe twofold representation of the datasets (Web pages\nand generic term weights) leaves much room for various\ndirections of experimentation. For example, Web structure\nmining and structural analysis techniques can be applied to\nthe Web pages, while the provided term weight representa-\ntion will certainly beneÔ¨Åt from term selection, length nor-\nmalization, and experimentation with different formulations\nfort fandid f.\n4. IDENTIFICATION OF CLASSICAL MUSIC\nThe task of automatically identifying an audio recording is\na typical MIR task, consisting of the clustering in the samegroup recordings of different performances of a composi-\ntion. Also in this case, a real-life application scenario has\nbeen considered: loosely labeled digital acquisition of old\nanalogue recordings of classical music should be automat-\nically annotated with metadata (composer, title, movement,\nexcerpt). Although systems for automatic music identiÔ¨Åca-\ntion already give good results, the combination of segmen-\ntation and identiÔ¨Åcation of continuous recordings is not well\ninvestigated yet. The participants are provided by a set of\ndigital acquisitions of vinyls made by the Fonoteca, that has\nto be segmented and labeled.\nAn important aspect addressed by this task is the scalabil-\nity of the approaches. To this end, we encourage participants\nto test the performance on the same task with a reference col-\nlection of increasing size, up to about 6,700 MP3s. This is\nachieved by providing additional information on the record-\ning that can help Ô¨Åltering out part of the dataset. In par-\nticular, the additional information is consistent with the one\nfounded in the real LP covers ‚Äì author, performer, short title\n‚Äì and is the sole information that is reported by the Fonoteca\ncatalogue. For this task, relevance judgments are provided\nautomatically using available metadata and listening directly\nto the recordings.\nParticipants are provided with content descriptors of the\ncomplete dataset of 6680 single music Ô¨Åles and with 22 ad-\nditional digital acquisitions of 11 LPs (thus a total of 22 LP\nsides is available on individual MP3s). There are two differ-\nent goal: to identify the songs belonging to the same group\n(for single Ô¨Åles) and to match the content of the LP record-\nings with the corresponding songs.\n4.1 DeÔ¨Ånition of the Dataset\nMusic identiÔ¨Åcation usually focuses on pop music (hence\nits common designation as cover song identiÔ¨Åcation). The\nreason for that might be attributed to the disproportion in\ncommercial interests for the pop music market with respect\nto other genres. Nonetheless the need for the application of\nsuch technology to other styles is often felt by many music\nlibraries and archives that, especially in Europe, aim at the\npreservation and dissemination of classical music.\nThe collection that we propose was created starting from\nthe database of a broadcasting company consisting of about\n320,000 music recordings in MP3 format (see Section 2.1).\nOur primary aim was to extract from it the largest possible\nsub-collection of classical music in order to build a shared\ndataset for the classical music identiÔ¨Åcation task. We se-\nlected 2,671 such recordings, associated to works that are\nrepresented at least twice in the database. These recordings\nform 945 cover sets10; the distribution of the set cardinal-\nities follows a power law, and is represented in Figure 2.\nThe distribution of the recordings with respect to the works‚Äô\nauthors is depicted in Figure 3. The collection was Ô¨Ånally\n10The phrase ‚Äúcover set‚Äù denotes a set of different recordings of the same\nunderlying piece of music.\n607Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nFigure 2 :Distribution of cover set cardinalities for the classical music cover identiÔ¨Åcation task.\n100 300\nBACH\nBEETHOVEN\nBRAHMS\nCHOPIN\nDEBUSSY\nDVORAK\nGRIEG\nHAENDEL\nHAYDN\nLISZT\nMONTEVERDI\nMOZART\nRA VEL\nROSSINI\nSCHUMANN\nSCRIABIN\nSTRAUSS J.

In particular, we\nprecomputed audio descriptors (chroma vectors) that are di-\nrectly available to participants. Chroma vectors have been\ncomputed at different temporal and frequency resolutions.\nAlso in this case, feature sets have been computed using\nthe MIRToolbox [7] algorithms, which are publicly avail-\nable. Moreover, participants can request the extraction of\nadditional descriptors (which may include also additional\nchroma vectors computed with different algorithms). It is\nimportant to note that datasets of any size can be processed\nthanks to implicit memory management mechanisms devel-\noped in MIRtoolbox.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper introduces MusiCLEF, a new benchmarking ac-\ntivity that aims at fostering content- and context-based anal-\nysis techniques to improve music information retrieval tasks,\nwith a special focus on multimodal approaches. A one-day\nMusiCLEF workshop is to be held in 2011 in Amsterdam aspart of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) con-\nference, where participants can share their approaches and\ncontribute to the future organization of MusiCLEF.\n6.

This paper presents a particle Ô¨Ålter-\nbased audio-to-score alignment method with a Ô¨Çexible ob-\nservation model based on latent harmonic allocation. Our\nmethod adapts to the harmonic structure for the audio-to-\nscore matching based on the observation of the audio signal\nthrough Bayesian inference. Experimental results with 20\npolyphonic songs reveal that our method is effective when\nmore number of instruments are involved in the ensemble.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMusic information retrieval tasks require a robust inference\nunder the uncertainty in musical audio signals. For example,\na polyphonic or multi-instrument aspect encumbers the fun-\ndamental frequency estimation [10, 15] or instrument iden-\ntiÔ¨Åcation [9]. Overcoming the uncertainty in musical audio\nsignals is a key factor in the machine comprehension of mu-\nsical information. The audio-to-score alignment technology\nshares this uncertainty problem in that an audio signal per-\nformed by human musicians has a wide range of varieties\ngiven a symbolic score due to the musicians‚Äô expressive-\nness.

Score: \n1. fixed harmonic structures \n2. equal mixture ratio Figure 1 . The issue: uncertainty in the audio and Ô¨Åxed har-\nmonic templates from the score\nor pitch Ô¨Çuctuations affect the resulting audio signals.\nIncremental audio-to-score alignment, also known as score\nfollowing , methods are essential to automatic accompani-\nment systems [5], intelligent score viewers [2], and robot\nmusicians [13] because the alignment synchronizes these\nsystems with human performances. We need a probabilis-\ntic framework for the audio-to-score alignment problem in\norder to cope with the uncertainty in the audio signal gener-\nated from the score in a symbolic representation.\nExisting methods tend to fail the alignment when mul-\ntiple musical notes are played by multiple musical instru-\nments. That is, the audio signal contains various timbres and\nthe volume ratio of each musical note is unsure. Figure 1\nillustrates this issue. The observed pitched audio signal in-\ncludes equally-spaced peaks in frequency domain called a\nharmonic structure. The observed audio is matched with\nharmonic structure templates generated from the score. Mu-\nsical notes written in the score is played with arbitrary musi-\ncal instruments. The resulting audio harmonic structures can\nvary from instrument to instrument whereas the templates of\nthe score have been set in advance using some heuristics or\na parameter learning [4]. In Figure 1, harmonic structures\nof a guitar and a violin is shown in blue and red lines, re-\nspectively. Furthermore, the mixture ratio of each note in\nthe audio is unknown until the observation while the ratio in\nthe template is Ô¨Åxed, typically equal.\nThus, the variety of the audio signal causes a mismatch\n525Poster Session 4\nFrequency  xAmplitude Amplitude \nAmplitude \nFrequency  xProbability distribution Frequency  x l¬µl¬µ2lm¬µL1lŒ∏\n2lŒ∏\nlm Œ∏1‚àíŒõlMharmonics \nN\nLdGMMs dl œÄFigure 2 .

We need a Ô¨Çexible harmonic struc-\nture model to robustly match the audio and score since the\naudio signal is almost unknown until we observe it.\nOur idea is to employ a Bayesian harmonic structure model\ncalled latent harmonic allocation (LHA) [15]. This model\nallows us to form harmonic structure templates reÔ¨Çecting\nthe observed audio with the prior knowledge written in the\nscore, e.g., fundamental frequencies of musical notes.\n1.1 Related work\nTwo important aspects reside in modeling audio-to-score\nalignment: (1) a temporal model of musical notes and (2)\nan observation model of the input audio signal from the\ncorresponding score. Although improvements are made re-\npeatedly for the temporal model, misalignments are often\ncaused by static and Ô¨Åxed audio observation models. The\naudio observation model used in the methods introduced in\nthis section uses static features such as chroma vectors or\nÔ¨Åxed harmonic structure templates based on Gaussian mix-\nture model (GMM). These features are often heuristically\ndesigned and therefore lose robustness against uncertain sit-\nuations in which many instruments are involved and the au-\ndio is polyphonic.\nMost audio-to-score alignment methods employ dynamic\ntime warping (DTW) [2,6], hidden Markov models (HMM) [4,\n12], or particle Ô¨Ålters [7, 11, 13]. DTW or HMM-based\nmethods sometimes fails the alignment since the length of\nmusical notes is less constrained in the decoding.\nThe note length corresponds to the length of a state se-\nquence in the HMM. Cont‚Äôs method [3] uses a hidden semi-\nMarkov model (HSMM) to control state lengths. The HSMM\nrestricts the duration of a stay at one state so that the state\nlength is limited. While the model refrains from delayed\nstate transitions, this has no restriction on fast transitions.\nAs a result, the HSMM tends to estimate the audio signal\nfaster than it is.Some methods estimate not only the score position but\nalso the tempo, i.e., the speed of the music for the tempo-\nral accuracy. Raphael‚Äôs method includes the tempo of the\nmusic as a state [14] to accurately decode the note lengths.\nOtsuka et al. [13] propose a particle Ô¨Ålter-based method for\ntheir simultaneous estimation. While Raphael‚Äôs method ob-\nserves only harmonic structures as pitch information, Ot-\nsuka et al.‚Äôs method observes the periodicity of the onsets to\ndirectly estimate the tempo.\n2. AUDIO OBSERVATION MODEL\nThis Section describes how the audio is generated in terms\nof LHA. We focus on harmonic structures to associate an\naudio signal with a symbolic score. The LHA model Ô¨Çexibly\nÔ¨Åts the shape of harmonic structures given an audio signal\nobservation using variational Bayes inference.\nThe harmonic peaks are often modeled as a Gaussian\nmixture model (GMM) by regarding each peak as a sin-\ngle Gaussian [3, 13, 14]. The black lines in Figure 1 are\nthe GMM curves. These methods use Kullback-Leibler di-\nvergence (KL-div) as a matching function between the au-\ndio harmonics and the GMM template harmonics generated\nfrom the score by regarding the harmonic structure as a prob-\nability distribution. The mean value of each Gaussian peak\nis determined by a pitch speciÔ¨Åed in the score.\nLHA [15] is a generative model for harmonic structures\nof pitched sounds. A graphical model for LHA is depicted\nin Figure 3. In the LHA model, the amplitude of audio har-\nmonics is regarded as a histogram over the frequency bins.\nFigures 2 and 3 explain how a mixture of harmonic struc-\ntures is generated. Variables in a circle are random variables\nwhile those without a circle are parameters. Double circled\nxnmeans an observed variable. For each segment d,Nd,\nfrequencies xnare observed. The audio spectrogram is seg-\nmented into dby chords, which are sets of musical notes. To\nsample each xn, aLdM-dimensional multinomial latent vari-\nable znis sampled as follows.

Variables œÄand\nŒ∏are conjugate priors for Z, and the precision of Gaussian\nharmonics Œõis a conjugate prior for X. Here, Œ±0,Œ≤0,a0, and\nb0are hyperparameters for each distribution. Œ±0= [Œ±0l]Ld\nl=1\nis set as Œ±0l=1, and Œ≤0= [Œ≤0m]M\nm=1is set as Œ≤0m=1 be-\ncause the mixture ratio of each musical note and the height\nof each harmonic are unknown. A ‚ÄúÔ¨Çat‚Äù prior knowledge\nabout these parameters is preferred to reÔ¨Çect our ignorance.\nThe hyperparameters of the gamma distribution are empir-\nically set as a0=1 and b0=2.4 by considering the width\nof harmonics determined by the window function of a short-\ntime Fourier transform (STFT).\nThe LHA is originally designed for multi-pitch analy-\nsis [15], and therefore the fundamental frequency ¬µlis a\nrandom variable. However, in our audio-to-score alignment\nframework, ¬µlis treated as a parameter because fundamen-\ntal frequencies are given by the score as musical notes. This\nis why ¬µlis not in a circle in Figure 3.\nIn general, too Ô¨Çexible model can cause an over-Ô¨Åtting\nproblem. LHA is Ô¨Çexible in terms of the mixture ratio œÄand\nharmonic heights Œ∏. To limit the model complexity, we Ô¨Åx\nthe harmonic heights Œ∏and only consider the mixture ratio\nœÄas in Figure 4. We refer to the former model in Figure 3\nasfull LHA , and the latter in Figure 4 as mixture LHA .3. AUDIO-TO-SCORE ALIGNMENT USING\nPARTICLE FILTER\nThis section presents the problem setting and procedures of\nour method. The problem is speciÔ¨Åed as follows:\n\u0013 \u0010\nInputs: incremental audio signal and the correspond-\ning whole score\nOutputs: the current score position and tempo\nAssumptions: (1) The score includes musical notes\nand the approximate tempos of the music. (2) Musical\nnotes are pairs of their pitch and length, e.g., a quar-\nter note, (3) Approximate tempos are speciÔ¨Åed as the\nrange of a tempo, e.g., 90‚Äì110 beats per minute (bpm).\n\u0012 \u0011\nNo prior knowledge about musical instruments is assumed.\n3.1 Method overview\nLetkbe the index of Ô¨Åltering steps and At,fbe the ampli-\ntude of the input audio signal in the time-frequency domain.\nHere, tandfdenote the time (sec) and the frequency (Hz),\nrespectively. Our system is implemented at a sampling rate\nof 44100 (Hz), a window length of 2048 (pt), and a hop size\nof 441 (pt). ¬ØAt,fdenotes a quantized integer amplitude given\nby¬ØAt,f=‚åäAt,f/‚àÜA‚åã, where ‚àÜAis the quantization factor,\nand‚åä¬∑‚åãis the Ô¨Çooring function. ‚àÜA=3.0 in our implemen-\ntation. This value should be so small that the shape of the\nspectrum is preserved after the quantization and that sufÔ¨Å-\ncient observations are provided for the Bayesian inference\nin the LHA. Let p(beat) be the score position. The score is\ndivided into frames whose lengths are equal to 1 /12 of one\nbeat, namely, a quarter note1. Musical notes are denoted by\n¬µp= [¬µ1\np...¬µLp\np]T, where Lpis the number of notes at p, and\n¬µis the fundamental frequency of the note.\nFigure 5 illustrates the procedures. At every ‚àÜT(sec), the\nparticle Ô¨Åltering [1] proceeds as: (a) move particles in accor-\ndance with elapsed ‚àÜT(sec) by drawing particles from the\nproposal distribution, (b) calculate the weight of each parti-\ncle, (c) report the point estimation of the score position and\nbeat interval, and resample the particles. Each particle has\n1pis discretized at 1/12 interval in (beat).\n527Poster Session 4\nscore frame p\nonset frames Figure 6 . Score position proposal.

The poste-\nrior distribution is approximated using many particles as in\np(sk|Ak) =‚àëI\ni=1wi\nkŒ¥(si\nk‚àísk), where Iis the number of par-\nticles, and si\nk= [pi\nk,bi\nk]denotes the state of the ith particle.2\nThe weight of each particle wi\nkis calculated as:\nwi\nk‚àùp(si\nk|si\nk‚àí1)p(Ak|si\nk)\nq(si\nk|si\nk‚àí1,Ak), (5)\nwhere p(si\nk|si\nk‚àí1)andp(Ak|si\nk)in the numerator are the state\ntransition model and observation model, respectively. New\nscore position and beat interval values are drawn at each step\nfrom the proposal distribution q(si\nk|si\nk‚àí1,Ak).\n3.2 Drawing particles from the proposal distribution\nParticles are drawn from the proposal distribution in Eq. (6).\nFirst, a new beat interval bi\nkis drawn, then a new score po-\nsition pi\nkis drawn depending on the drawn bi\nk. The proposal\nis designed to draw (1) a beat interval that lies in the tempo\nrange provided by the score and that matches the intervals\namong audio onsets and (2) a score position that matches the\nincrease of the audio amplitude with the score onset frame.\nsi\nk‚àºq(b,p|si\nk‚àí1,Ak)\n‚àùR(b;Ak)Œ®(b;Àúb)√óQ(p;b,Ak,si\nk‚àí1).

Q(p;b,Ak,si\nk‚àí1)\ndenotes the onset matching function.Detailed equations are\nexplained in [13].\nThe onset matching function Q(p;b,Ak,si\nk‚àí1)in Eq. (6)\nrepresents how well the audio and score are aligned in terms\nof the onsets. Figure 6 explains the design. The top case in\n2Œ¥(x) =1 iffx=0, otherwise Œ¥(x) =0.which audio frames with a peak power is aligned with score\nonsets results in the larger Q, where as the bottom case Qis\na small value since the onsets are misaligned. The detailed\nmathematical expressions are presented in [13].\n3.3 Weight calculation\nThe weight for each particle is calculated with the sampled\nvalue si\nkin Eq. (5) by using the state transition model,\np(si\nk|si\nk‚àí1) = N(pi\nk|ÀÜpi\nk,œÉ2\np)√óN(bi\nk|bi\nk‚àí1,œÉ2\nb),(7)\nand the observation model,\np(Ak|si\nk)‚àùp(Ak|pi\nk)√óR(bi\nk;Ak). (8)\nThe score position transition conforms to a linear Gaussian\nmodel with the transition ÀÜ pi\nk=pi\nk‚àí1+‚àÜT/bi\nk‚àí1and the vari-\nanceœÉ2\np(beat2). The beat interval transition is a random\nwalk model with the variance œÉ2\nb(sec2/beat2). The variances\nare empirically set as œÉ2\np=0.25 and œÉ2\nb=0.1, respectively.\nFor the observation of the beat interval, the normalized\ncross-correlation of the audio spectrogram, R(bi\nk;Ak), is again\nused in Eq. (8). The other factor p(Ak|pi\nk)is the likeli-\nhood corresponding to the pitch information. As explained\nin Section 2, the GMM-based harmonic structures are used\nto match the audio and score. First, the matching with KL-\ndiv is presented as a baseline where all the GMM parame-\nters, the chord mixture ratio œÄor harmonic heights Œ∏, and\nthe Gaussian width Œª, are Ô¨Åxed. Then, we explain two types\nof LHA-based audio-to-score matchings, the full LHA and\nmixture LHA, where the GMM parameters are probability\nvariables that Ô¨Çexibly adapt to the observed audio harmonic\nstructure. Full LHA adapts all œÄ,Œ∏, and Œªwhereas mixture\nLHA adapts only œÄandŒªto the audio. Further discussion\nof the difference is in Section 4.\nThe KL-div matching uses a normalized amplitude spec-\ntrogram ¬¥Akwhile the LHA models use the quantized spec-\ntrogram ¬ØAk. To match the buffered audio, the audio spectro-\ngram Akor¬ØAkis aligned with the score shown as Figure 7.\nAs the time k‚àÜTis assigned to pi\nkwith the beat interval bi\nk,\nthe audio frame œÑis linearly assigned to the score frame as\ngiven by\nÀúp(œÑ) = pi\nk‚àí(k‚àÜT‚àíœÑ)/bi\nk.

The ratio of each note is equally\nset as œÄl=1/Lp. The height of the mth harmonic is set\nasŒ∏m=0.2m‚àí1. The variance is set as œÉ2\nKL=2.4, derived\nfrom the window function used in STFT.

The\nsubscript ¬∑means a summation over the replaced index.\nHere, the audio likelihood using KL-div is deÔ¨Åned as\nlogp(Ak|si\nk) = ‚àí‚àë\nœÑ‚ààTk‚àë\nf¬¥AœÑ,flog¬¥AœÑ,f\nÀÜAÀúp(œÑ),f,(11)\nwhere ¬¥AœÑ,f=AœÑ,f/AœÑ,¬∑is the normalized amplitude. The\nright-hand side of Eq. (11) is a negative KL-div between the\naudio harmonic structure and the GMM harmonic template.\n3.3.2 LHA-based likelihood calculation\nWe Ô¨Årst explain how LHA is used as the likelihood, then\nshow the iterations for both full and mixture LHA infer-\nences. The quantized amplitudes ¬ØAkare regarded as a his-\ntogram of amplitudes over frequency bins Xillustrated as\ngray bars in Figure 2. The rigorous likelihood in Eq. (5) is\np(X|si\nk) =‚àë\nZ‚à´‚à´‚à´\np(X,Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ|pi\nk,¬µ)dœÄdŒ∏dŒõ.(12)\nSince this analytical summation over Zis intractable3, we\ninfer the latent variables Z,œÄ,Œ∏, andŒõby variational Bayes\n(VB) method under the factorization assumption q(Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ) =\nq(Z)q(œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ). We use the variational lower bound for the\nweight calculation as an approximate observation model in-\nstead of Eq. (12),\nlogp(X|si\nk)‚âàL(q) =EZ,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ[\nlogp(X,Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ|pi\nk,¬µ)\nq(Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ)]\n,(13)\nwhere EZ,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ[¬∑]denotes an expectation over q(Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ).\nFor the inference of LHA, the audio is segmented by the\nchord in the score as shown in Figure 8. This segmentation\ndis made on the basis of the alignment by Eq. (9).\nThe variational lower bound in Eq. (13) is maximized\nwith the following variational posteriors:\nq(Z) =‚àè\ndnlmŒ≥zdnlm\ndnlm,q(œÄ) =‚àè\ndDir(œÄd|Œ±d),\nq(Œ∏) =‚àè\nlDir(Œ∏l|Œ≤l),q(Œõ) =‚àè\nlGam (Œõl|al,bl),\nthe parameters of which are updated as\nŒ≥dnlm =œÅdnlm/œÅdn¬∑¬∑, (14)\nlogœÅdnlm=œà(Œ±dl)‚àíœà(Œ±d¬∑) +œà(Œ≤lm)‚àíœà(Œ≤l¬∑)\n+œà(al)/2‚àí(logbl)/2‚àí(xn‚àím¬µl)2al/2bl,(15)\n3The integration over œÄ,Œ∏, andŒõis tractable thanks to their conjugacy.Œ±dl=Œ±0l+Œ≥d¬∑l¬∑,Œ≤lm=Œ≤0m+Œ≥¬∑¬∑lm,\nal=a0+Œ≥¬∑¬∑l¬∑\n2,bl=b0+‚àëdnmŒ≥dnlm(xdn‚àím¬µl)2\n2,(16)\nwhere œà(¬∑)in Eq. (15) denotes the digamma function. Eqs. (14,15)\nand Eqs. (16) are iteratively calculated until the lower bound\nin Eq. (13) converges. Note that Eq. (14) is the normaliza-\ntion of œÅover indices landm.\nMixture LHA update : In the update for the mixture LHA\nmodel, the harmonic height parameter is set as Œ∏lm=0.2m‚àí1.\nThus, the update equations are modiÔ¨Åed as:\nlogœÅdnlm=œà(Œ±dl)‚àíœà(Œ±d¬∑) +logŒ∏lm\nœà(al)/2‚àí(logbl)/2‚àí(xn‚àím¬µl)2al/2bl,(17)\nŒ±dl=Œ±0l+Œ≥d¬∑l¬∑,\nal=a0+Œ≥¬∑¬∑l¬∑\n2,bl=b0+‚àëdnmŒ≥dnlm(xdn‚àím¬µl)2\n2.(18)\nRelationship with the KL-div likelihood : Remember the\nnegative KL-div is used as the log-likelihood in Eq. (11).\nThe following equation always holds during the iterations:\nL(q) +KL(q||p) =logp(X|si\nk) (const wrt .q).\nThe KL-div is deÔ¨Åned between the approximate distribu-\ntionq(Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ)and the true posterior p(Z,œÄ,Œ∏,Œõ|X,pi\nk,¬µ).\nNote that maximizing L(q)is equivalent to minimizing KL-\ndiv, namely, maximizing the negative KL-div due to the\nequation above. Thus, the LHA-based likelihood is inter-\npreted as an extension of Eq. (11) in that the harmonic tem-\nplates adapt to the audio observation to minimize the KL-div\nand maximize the log-likelihood.\n3.4 Point estimation and efÔ¨Åcient computing\nAfter the weights of all particles are calculated, the point\nestimation is reported as ÀÜsk=‚àëI\ni=1wi\nksi\nk/\n‚àëI\ni=1wi\nk. Particles\nare resampled after the point estimation procedure to elimi-\nnate zero-weight particles. The resampling probability is in\nproportion to the weight of each particle [1].\n4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThis section presents the alignment error of three observa-\ntion models; conventional KL-div [13], full LHA, and mix-\nture LHA. Twenty songs from RWC Jazz music database [8]\nis used for this experiment. This test set includes various\ncompositions of musical instruments from solo performance\nto big band ensembles. Our system is implemented on Linux\nOS and a 2.4 (GHz) processor. Experiments are carried out\nwith the following parameter settings; the Ô¨Åltering interval\n‚àÜT=0.5 (sec), the window length for the audio processing\nW=1.5 (sec), and the number of particles I=300.\nFigure 9 shows the error percentiles of 20 songs for three\nmethods. Black, red, and blue bars represent the percentiles\nof KL-div, full LHA, and mixture LHA, respectively. The\ndarkest bars are the 50% percentiles, middle bars are the\n75%, and the lightest segments are the 100% percentiles.\nThe less values indicate the better performance.

Error percentiles for 20 songs\nLHA-based methods outperform the KL-div for 10 songs,\nand either full or mixture LHA shows less errors than KL-\ndiv for 3 songs. In particular, LHA-based methods tend to\nreport less errors when the song consists of a larger number\nof instruments (larger ID songs). This is what we expect\nfrom the LHA models.\nTwo major reasons are given why LHA-based observa-\ntion models still accumulate the alignment error. First, LHA\nis vulnerable to rest notes where no musical note is speci-\nÔ¨Åed. This is because the LHA model penalizes unspeciÔ¨Åed\nharmonic peaks. When the score provides a rest, LHA pe-\nnalizes any audio observation. The error caused by these rest\nnotes is seen in songs 2, 5, 8, and 9, where we have more\nchances to have rest notes because the number of musical\ninstruments is relatively small. The second reason is the\nnon-harmonic feature of percussions and drums. Because\ndrum sounds are loud and outstanding in the ensemble, these\nsounds interfere the harmonic structures of pitched sounds\nassumed by LHA. This case applies in songs 11, 16, and 17\nwhere drums are included in the ensemble.\nHere we discuss the difference between the full and mix-\nture LHAs. Since mixture LHA has less variables to in-\nfer, we can expect more accurate inference as long as the\nÔ¨Åxed parameters Œ∏Ô¨Åt the observation. The Ô¨Åxed Œ∏declines\nas the frequency becomes larger. This descending height is\nwell observed in stringed instruments such as guitar or piano\ndominantly used in songs 1-6; whereas wind instruments\nsuch as saxophone or Ô¨Çute or bowed instruments such as vi-\nolin show rather different peaks. When these instruments\nare dominant in a song, e.g., songs 16 and 17 which are in a\nbig band style, the full LHA will be the better choice.\n5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS\nThe experiment has shown that LHA is especially effec-\ntive in a large-ensemble situation where more musical notes\nare simultaneously performed. However, LHA-based audio\nobservation models is disturbed by (1) rest notes and (2)\ndrum sounds. To make the best use of the LHA model, one\npromising solution is to examine the musical score in ad-\nvance of the alignment whether the expecting audio signal\nis suitable for LHA. The development of this top-level deci-sion making process will be one of the future works.\nAnother future work includes an accelerated calculation\nof LHA iterations for such real-time applications as auto-\nmatic accompaniment systems.

INTRODUCTION\nA music signal carries a highly structured information at\nseveral levels. At the lowest level, a structure is deÔ¨Åned\nby the individual notes, their timbral characteristics, as well\nas their pitch and time intervals. At an intermediate level,\nthe notes build relatively longer structures, such as melodic\nphrases, chords, and chord progressions. At the highest\nlevel, the structural description of an entire music recording\n(i.e., its musical form) emerges at the time scale of music\nsections, such as intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro [16,\n17].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc‚Éù2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.The musical form of a recording is a high-level informa-\ntion that can be exploited in several music information re-\ntrieval (MIR) tasks, including music thumbnailing and sum-\nmarization [3], chord transcription [12], music semantics\nlearning and music annotation [1], song segment retrieval\n[1], and remixing [9]. Consequently, the interest in the au-\ntomatic music form extraction orstructure analysis has in-\ncreased as is manifested by the considerably amount of re-\nsearch that has been done so far [1,9,10,16,19]. For a com-\nprehensive review the interested reader is referred to [6, 17]\n(and the references therein). The majority of methods tested\nfor automatic music structure analysis applies a signal pro-\ncessing stage followed by a representation stage. In the Ô¨Årst\nstage, low-level feature sequences are extracted from the au-\ndio signal in order to model its timbral, melodic, and rhyth-\nmic content [17]. This is consistent with the Ô¨Åndings of\nBruderer et al. , who state that the perception of structural\nboundaries in popular music is mainly inÔ¨Çuenced by the\ncombination of changes in timbre, tonality, and rhythm over\nthe music piece [2]. At the representation stage, a recur-\nrence plot or a similarity matrix is analyzed in order to iden-\ntify repetitive patterns in the feature sequences by employ-\ning hidden Markov models, clustering methods, etc. [6, 17].\nIn this paper, an unsupervised approach for automatic\nmusic structure analysis is proposed. To begin with, each\naudio recording is represented by a sequence of audio fea-\ntures capturing the variations between the different music\nsegments. Since the music structure is strongly determined\nby repetition, a similarity matrix should be constructed, that\nwill be analyzed next. Here, the similarity matrix is built\nby adopting an one-to-all sparse reconstruction rather than\none-to-one (i.e., pairwise) comparisons. To this end, the\n‚Ñì1-graph [5] is constructed in order to capture relationships\namong the feature vectors. The segmentation of audio fea-\ntures is obtained by applying spectral clustering to the ‚Ñì1-\ngraph. Apart from the conventional mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefÔ¨Åcients andchroma features, frequently employed in mu-\nsic structure analysis, the auditory temporal modulations\nare also tested here. The performance of the proposed ap-\nproach is assessed by conducting experiments on two man-\n495Poster Session 4\nually annotated benchmark datasets, namely the PopMu-\nsic [10] and the UPF Beatles. The experimental results val-\nidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in music\nstructure analysis reaching the performance of the state-of-\nthe-art music structure analysis methods.\nThe remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2,\nthe audio features employed are brieÔ¨Çy described. The ‚Ñì1-\ngraph based music structural analysis framework is detailed\nin Section 3. Datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental\nresults are presented in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn\nand future research directions are indicated in Section 5.\n2. AUDIO FEATURE REPRESENTATION\nEach 22.050-Hz sampled monaural waveform is parameter-\nized by employing three audio features in order to capture\nthe variations between different music segments. The fea-\nture set includes the auditory temporal modulations (ATMs),\nthemel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs), and the\nchroma features.\n1) Auditory temporal modulations: ATMs are obtained\nby modeling the path of human auditory processing. They\ncarry important time-varying information of the music sig-\nnal [15]. First, by modeling the early auditory system, the\nacoustic signal is converted into a time-frequency distribu-\ntion along a logarithmic frequency axis, the so-called au-\nditory spectrogram . In this paper, the early auditory sys-\ntem is modeled by employing the Lyons‚Äô passive ear model\n[11]. The derived auditory spectrogram consists of 96fre-\nquency channels ranging from 62Hz to 11kHz. The audi-\ntory spectrogram is then downsampled along the time axis\nby a factor of 150ms, which allows to focus on a more\nmeaningful time-scale for music structural analysis. The\nunderlying temporal modulations of the music signal are de-\nrived by applying a wavelet Ô¨Ålter along each temporal row\nof the auditory spectrogram for a set of 8discrete rates r\n‚àà {2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256}Hz ranging from slow to\nfast temporal rates [15]. Consequently, the entire auditory\nspectrogram is modeled by a three-dimensional representa-\ntion of frequency, rate, and time, which is then unfolded\nalong the time-mode in order to obtain a sequence of two-\ndimensional ATM features.\n2) Mel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients: MFCCs param-\neterize the rough shape of spectral envelope [13] and thus\nencode the timbral properties of the music signal, which\nare closely related to the perception of music structure [2].\nFollowing [16], the MFCCs calculation employs frames of\nduration 92.9ms with a hope size of 46.45ms, and a 42-\nband Ô¨Ålter bank. The correlation between frequency bands\nis reduced by applying the discrete cosine transform along\nthe log-energies of the bands. The lowest coefÔ¨Åcient (i.e.,\nzero-th order) is discarded and the subsequent 12coefÔ¨Å-\ncients form the feature vector that undergoes a zero-meannormalization.\n3) Chroma: Chroma features are adept in characteriz-\ning the harmonic content of the music signal by projecting\nthe entire spectrum onto 12bins representing the 12 distinct\nsemitones (or chroma) of a musical octave [13]. They are\ncalculated using 92.9ms frames with a hope size of 23.22\nms as follows. First, the salience for different fundamental\nfrequencies in the range 80‚àí640Hz is calculated. The lin-\near frequency scale is transformed into a musical one by se-\nlecting the maximum salience value in each frequency range\ncorresponding to one semitone. Finally, the octave equiva-\nlence classes are summed over the whole pitch range to yield\na12-dimensional chroma vector.\nAll the aforementioned features are averaged over the\nbeat (i.e., the basic unit of time in music) frames by em-\nploying the beat tracking algorithm described in [8]. Thus a\nsequence of beat-synchronous feature vectors is obtained.\n3. MUSIC STRUCTURE SEGMENTATION BASED\nON THE ‚Ñì1-GRAPH\nSince repetition governs the music structure, a common strat-\negy employed is to compare each feature vector of the music\nrecording with all other vectors in order to detect similari-\nties. Let a given audio recording be represented by a feature\nsequence of Nbeat frames, i.e., {x1,x2, . . . ,xN}. The\nsimilarity between the feature vectors is frequently mea-\nsured by constructing the self-similarity matrix (SDM) D‚àà\nRN√óNwith elements dij=d(xi,xj),i, j‚àà {i,2, . . . , N },\nwhere d(¬∑,¬∑)is a suitable distance metric [9, 16, 17]. Com-\nmon distance metrics are the Euclidean, dE(xi,xj) =‚à•xi‚àí\nxj‚à•2and the cosine distance, dC(xi,xj) = 0 .5(1‚àíxT\nixj\n‚à•xi‚à•2‚à•xj‚à•2,\nwhere ‚à•.‚à•2denotes the ‚Ñì2vector norm. However, the afore-\nmentioned approach suffers from two drawbacks: 1) It is\nvery sensitive to noise, since the employed distance metrics\nare not robust to noise. 2) The resulting SDM is dense and\nthus it cannot provide the locality information (i.e., to re-\nveal the relationships among neighbor feature vectors that\nbelong to the same segment class), which is valuable in the\nproblem under study.\nIn order to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks, we\npropose to measure the similarities between the feature vec-\ntors in an one-to-all sparse reconstruction manner rather\nthan to employ the conventional one-to-one distance appro-\nach by exploiting recent Ô¨Åndings in sparse subspace cluster-\ning [7].\nFormally, let a given audio recording of Kmusic seg-\nments be represented by a sequence of Naudio feature vec-\ntors of size M, i.e.,X= [x1|x2|. . .|xN]‚ààRM√óN. By\nassuming that the feature vectors belonging to the same mu-\nsic segment lie into the same subspace, the columns of X\nare drawn from a union of Kindependent linear subspaces\nof unknown dimensions. It has been proved that if a feature\n49612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nvector stems from a union of independent linear subspaces,\nit admits a sparse representation with respect to a dictio-\nnary formed by all other feature vectors with the nonzero\ncoefÔ¨Åcients associated to vectors drawn from its own sub-\nspace [7]. Therefore, by seeking the sparsest linear combi-\nnation, the relationship with the other vectors lying in the\nsame subspace is revealed automatically. A similarity graph\nbuilt from this sparse representation, the so-called ‚Ñì1-graph\n[5] is used then in order to segment the columns of Xinto\nKclusters by applying spectral clustering.\nLetXi= [x1|x2|. . .|xi‚àí1|xi+1|. . .|xN]‚ààRM√ó(N‚àí1).\nThe sparsest solution of xi=Xiccan be found by solving\nthe optimization problem:\nargmin\nc‚à•c‚à•0subject to xi=Xic, (1)\nwhere ‚à•.‚à•0is the ‚Ñì0quasi-norm returning the number of the\nnon-zero entries of a vector. Finding the solution to the opti-\nmization problem (1) is NP-hard due to the nature of the un-\nderlying combinational optimization. An approximate solu-\ntion to the problem (1) can be obtained by replacing the ‚Ñì0\nnorm with the ‚Ñì1norm as follows:\nargmin\nc‚à•c‚à•1subject to xi=Xic, (2)\nwhere ‚à•.‚à•1denotes the ‚Ñì1norm of a vector. It is well known\nthat if the solution is sparse enough and M << (N‚àí\n1), then the solution of (1) is equivalent to the solution of\n(2). The optimization problem (2) can be solved in poly-\nnomial time by standard linear programming methods [4].\nThe well-posedness of (2) relies on the condition M <<\n(N‚àí1), i.e., the sample size must be much larger than the\nfeature dimension. If the ATMs are used to represent au-\ndio, the sample size (i.e., the number of beats) is not much\nlarger than the feature vector dimension and thus the just-\nmentioned condition is violated, because M= 768 and\nN‚âà500on average in the experiments conducted. Ac-\ncordingly, cis no longer sparse. To alleviate this problem,\nit has been proposed to augment Xiby an M√óMidentity\nmatrix and to solve:\nargmin\nc‚à•c‚à•1subject to xi=Bc, (3)\ninstead of (2), where B= [Xi|I]‚ààRM√ó((N‚àí1)+M)[20].\nSince the sparse coefÔ¨Åcient vector creveals the relation-\nships among xiand the feature vectors in Xi, the overall\nsparse representation of the whole feature sequence Xcan\nbe summarized by constructing the weight matrix Wusing\nAlgorithm 1. Wcan be used to deÔ¨Åne the so-called ‚Ñì1-graph\n[5]. The ‚Ñì1-graph is a directed graph G= (V,E), where\nthe vertices of graph Vare the Naudio feature vectors and\nan edge (ui, uj)‚ààEexists, whenever xjparticipates in\nthe sparse representation of xi. Accordingly, the adjacencyAlgorithm 1 ‚Ñì1-Graph Construction [5].\nInput: Audio feature sequence X‚ààRM√óN.\nOutput: Weight matrix W‚ààRN√óN.\n1:fori= 1‚ÜíNdo\n2:B= [Xi|I].\n3: argminc‚à•c‚à•1subject to xi=Bc.\n4: forj= 1‚ÜíNdo\n5: ifj < i then\n6: wij=cj.\n7: else\n8: wij=cj‚àí1.\n9: end if\n10: end for\n11:end for\nmatrix of GisW. Unlike the conventional SDM, the adja-\ncency matrix Wis robust to noise. The ‚Ñì1-graphGis an un-\nbalanced digraph. A balanced graph ÀÜGcan be built with ad-\njacency matrix ÀÜWwith elements ÀÜwij= 0.5 (|wij|+|wji|),\nwhere |.|denotes the absolute value. ÀÜWis still a valid rep-\nresentation of the similarity between the features vectors,\nsince if xican be expressed as a compact linear combina-\ntion of some feature vectors including xj(all from the same\nsubspace or music segment here), then xjcan also be ex-\npressed as a compact linear combination of feature vectors\nin the same subspace including xi[7]. In Figure 1, the ÀÜWis\ndepicted for the three features tested. It can be seen that ÀÜW\nhas a block structure for the ATMs, while it is unstructured\nand more dense for the MFCCs and the Chroma features.\nThis observation validates that the main assumptions made\nin the paper hold here for the ATMs, but not for the MFCCs\nand the Chroma features.\nThe segmentation of the audio feature vectors can be ob-\ntained by spectral clustering algorithms, such as the normal-\nized cuts [18] as illustrated in Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2 Music Segmentation via ‚Ñì1-Graph.\nInputs: Audio feature sequence X‚ààRM√óNand number\nof segments K.\nOutput: Audio feature sequence segmentation.\n1:Obtain the adjacency matrix Wof‚Ñì1-graph by\nAlgorithm 1.\n2:Build the symmetric adjacency matrix of the ‚Ñì1-graph\nÀÜG:ÀÜW= 0.5¬∑(|W|+|WT|).\n3:Employ normalized cuts [18] to segment the vertices of\nÀÜGintoKclusters.\n497Poster Session 4\nFigure 1 .

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nThe performance of the proposed music structure analysis\napproach is assessed by conducting experiments on two man-\nually annotated datasets of Western popular music pieces.\nSeveral evaluation metrics are employed to assess system\nperformance from different points of view.\n4.1 Datasets\nPopMusic dataset [10]: The dataset consists of 60music\nrecordings of rock, pop, hip-hop, and jazz. Half of the\nrecordings originate from a variety of well-known artists\nappeared the past 40years, including Britney Spears, Em-\ninem, Madonna, Nirvana, etc. This subset is abbreviated as\nRecent hereafter. The remaining 30music recordings are by\nThe Beatles. The ground-truth segmentation of each song\ncontains between 2and15different segments classes. The\nnumber of classes is 6, while each recording is found to con-\ntain11segments on average [1,10]. The subset contains the\nBeatles recordings is referred ta as Beatles .\nUPF Beatles dataset :1The dataset consists of 174\nsongs by The Beatles that are annotated by the musicolo-\ngist Alan W. Pollack. Segmentation time stamps were in-\nserted at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) as well. Each\nmusic recording contains on average 10segments from 5\nunique classes [19]. Since all the recordings are from the\nsame band, there is less variation in the music style and the\ntimbral characteristics than the other datasets.\n4.2 Evaluation Metrics\nFollowing [1,9,10,16,19], the segment labels are evaluated\nby employing the pairwise F-measure, which is one of the\nstandard metrics of clustering quality. It compares pairs of\n1http://www.dtic.upf.edu/ perfe/annotations/sections/license.htmlbeats, which are assigned to the same cluster by music struc-\nture analysis against the reference segmentation. Let FAbe\nthe set of similarly labeled pairs of beats in a recording ac-\ncording to the music structure analysis algorithm and FHbe\nthe set of similarly labeled pairs in the human reference seg-\nmentation. The pairwise precision, Ppairwise , the pairwise\nrecall, Rpairwise , and the pairwise F-measure, Fpairwise ,\nare deÔ¨Åned as follows: Ppairwise =|FA‚à©FH|\n|FA|,Rpairwise =\n|FA‚à©FH|\n|FH|, and Fpairwise = 2¬∑Ppairwise ¬∑Rpairwise\nPpairwise +Rpairwise, where |.|\ndenotes the set cardinality. The average number of segments\nper song in each dataset is reported as well.\nThe segment boundary detection is evaluated separately\nby employing the standard precision, recall, and F-measure.\nFollowing [1, 10, 16], a boundary detected by the proposed\napproach is considered correct, if it falls within some Ô¨Åxed\nsmall distance Œ¥away from the reference boundary. Each\nreference boundary can be retrieved by at most one out-\nput boundary. Let BAandBHdenote the sets of segment\nboundaries according to the music structure analysis algo-\nrithm and the human reference, respectively. Then, P=\n|BA‚à©BH|\n|BA|,R=|BA‚à©BH|\n|BH|, and F= 2¬∑P¬∑R\nP+R. The parameter Œ¥\nis set to 3s in our experiments as was also done in [1,10,16].\n4.3 Experimental Results\nThe structural segmentation is obtained by applying the pro-\nposed approach to various feature sequences. Following the\nexperimental setup employed in [1,9,10,16,19], the number\nof clusters Kwas set to 6for the PopMusic dataset, while\nK= 4 for the UPF Beatles dataset. For comparison pur-\nposes, experiments are conducted by applying the normal-\nized cuts [18] apart from the ‚Ñì1-graph and the SDM with the\nEuclidean distance computed for the three audio features.\nThe segment-type labeling performance for the PopMusic\nand the UPF Beatles datasets is summarized in Table 1 and\n49812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTable 2, respectively.\nMethod/Reference Dataset Fpairwise Av.

Segment-type labeling performance on the Pop-\nMusic dataset.\nBy inspecting Tables 1 and 2, it is clear that the ‚Ñì1-graph\nbased segmentation outperforms the SDM based segmenta-\ntion in terms of pairwise F-measure for all the audio fea-\ntures employed in both datasets. Moreover, the ATMs offer\na parsimonious representation for the task of music struc-\nture analysis, especially when employed in the construction\nof the ‚Ñì1-graph.\nThe best results reported for segment-type labeling on\nthe PopMusic dataset are obtained here, when the ATMs are\nemployed for audio representation and the segmentation is\nperformed on the ‚Ñì1-graph deÔ¨Åned by them. These results\nare comparable to the best reported results by Levy and San-\ndler [10], while inferior to those reported by Barrington et\nal.[1]. It is worth noting that the clustering is performed\nwithout any constraints in the proposed approach, which is\nnot the case for the best results reported in [1, 10].

The reported\nresults are comparable to those obtained by the state-of-the-\nart music structure analysis on this dataset [16, 19]. The\nproposed approach is not directly comparable to that in [9]\ndue to the use of slightly different reference segmentations.\nThe average number of segments detected by our ap-\nproach is 11.86and8.52, when according to the ground-\ntruth the actual average number of segments is 11and10\nfor the PopMusic and the UPF Beatles dataset, respectively.\nThis result is worth noting since no constraints have been\nenforced during clustering.\nThe performance of the proposed approach deteriorates\nwhen either the MFCCs or the chroma features are employed\nfor music representation. The low pairwise F-measure and\nthe over-segmentation can be be attributed to the fact that\nthe underlying assumptions set in Section 3 do not hold for\nsuch representations.\nSince the performance of our approach is clearly inferior\nwhen MFCCs or chroma features are used for music rep-\nresentation, only the ATMs are employed in the segment-\nboundary detection task. The boundary detection results are\nsummarized in Table 3 for both the PopMusic and the UPF\nBeatles datasets. EchoNest refers to the commercial online\nmusic boundary detection service provided by The Echon-\nest and evaluated in [1]. By inspecting Table 3 the pro-\nposed approach is clearly inferior to the system proposed\nby Levy and Sandler [10] for music boundary detection on\nboth datasets. The success of the latter approach can be at-\ntributed to the constraints imposed during clustering. Con-\nsequently, the results obtained by the proposed approach in\nmusic boundary detection could be considered as accept-\nable, since the performance of our system is rated above\nthat reported for many other state-of-the-art systems with or\nwithout constraints (e.g., the EchoNest online service). It\nis worth mentioning that neither of the methods appearing\nin Table 3 reaches the accuracy of the specialized bound-\n499Poster Session 4\nary detection methods (e.g., that in [14]) which achieves a\nboundary F-measure of 0.75on a test set similar to the Bea-\ntles subset of the PopMusic dataset. However, such bound-\nary detection methods, do not model the music structure\nand provide no characterization of the segments between the\nboundaries as the proposed approach as well as the methods\nin [1, 9, 10, 16, 19] do.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nA novel unsupervised music structure analysis approach has\nbeen proposed. This framework resorts to ATMs for mu-\nsic representation, while the segmentation is performed by\napplying spectral clustering on the ‚Ñì1-graph. The perfor-\nmance of the proposed approach is assessed by conducting\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets. The experimental\nresults on music structure analysis are comparable to those\nreported by other state-of-the-art music structure analysis\nsystems. Moreover, promising results on music boundary\ndetection are reported. It is believed that by imposing con-\nstraints during clustering in the proposed approach both the\nmusic structure analysis and the music boundary detection\nwill be considerably improved. This point will be investi-\ngated in the future. Another future research direction is to\nautomatically detect the number of music segments.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research has been co-Ô¨Ånanced by the European Union\n(European Social Fund - ESF) and Greek national funds\nthrough the Operational Program ‚ÄúEducation and Lifelong\nLearning‚Äù of the National Strategic Reference Framework\n(NSRF) - Research Funding Program: Heraclitus II.

INTRODUCTION\nWe propose in this paper a new approach for structured\nsparsedecompositionofamusicsignalinanovercomplete\ntime-frequencydictionary. Startingfromexistingmethod s\nthat arebasedonphysicalsignalproperties,we proposeto\nincorporatemusicalpriorsinordertobuiltsignalreprese n-\ntations that are more suitable to music. For this, we take\nadvantageoftherecentworksthathavebeendoneonchord\nestimationinthe contextofmusiccontentprocessing.\nThe problem of representing an audio signal using a\ntime-frequency dictionary has been given a lot of atten-\ntion these last few years. The speciÔ¨Åcity of music audio\nsignalsisthat, veryoften,severaltypesof componentsare\nsuperimposed, as for instance tonal components (the par-\ntials of the notes) and transients (the attacks of the notes) .\nThese various components may have signiÔ¨Åcantly differ-\nent behaviors. For instance fast varying transient require\nshort analysis window whereas low varyingtonals require\nlongwindows. Thus,theycannotberepresentedwithinthe\nsame basis. This is why hybridmodels allowing a simul-\ntaneous representation of different components have been\nproposed[4,12,17,22].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom useis granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnotmadeordistributed forproÔ¨Åtorcommercialadvantagean dthatcopies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.Among the various existing transforms, the modiÔ¨Åed\ndiscretecosinetransform(MDCT)[15]isastandardchoice\nfor the bases[6,14]. Followingthese approaches,we con-\nsider in this work a dictionary built as the union of two\nMDCTbaseswithdifferenttime-frequencyresolutions. The\nnarrow band basis - with long time resolution - is used to\nestimate the tonal parts of the signal, and the wide band\nbasis - with short time resolution - is used to estimate the\ntransient parts. Such a dictionary is chosen overcomplete,\nand thus the expansion of the signal with respect to the\ndictionary is not unique. Sparsitymay be used as a selec-\ntion criterion for Ô¨Ånding the expansion coefÔ¨Åcients, in the\nsense that only a few coefÔ¨Åcients of the decomposition of\nthe signal on the bases are signiÔ¨Åcantly nonzero. The sig-\nnal can thus be well approximatedby a limited numberof\ncoefÔ¨Åcients. This problem is often referred to as sparse\nregression .\nA common approach to Ô¨Ånd a sparse expansion of sig-\nnals in overcomplete dictionaries consists of minimizing\nthe‚Ñì1norm of the expansion, and is known as basis pur-\nsuit[1], or LASSO [21]. Various methods have been also\nproposed: they include variational approaches [13], prob-\nabilistic approaches[14], greedy methods, such as match-\ningpursuitalgorithms[2,16],orBayesianformulationsas\nforinstanceEM-basedalgorithms[9]. Intheframeworkof\nBayesianvariableselection,MCMC(MarkovchainMonte\nCarlo)typeapproachesthatconsideradictionaryconstruc ted\nastheunionoftwoorthonormalbaseshavebeenproposed\n[5,7]. One of the main advantages of the MCMC tech-\nniques is their robustness because they scan the whole of\nthe posterior distribution and thus are unlikely to fall int o\nlocalminima. However,thisisdoneattheexpanseofhigh\ncomputationalcost.\nIn order to fully exploit the dual nature of audio music\nsignals mentioned above, some approaches consider de-\npendencies between signiÔ¨Åcant coefÔ¨Åcients. In the time-\nfrequencyplane,thepartialsofthenoteswillgeneratehor -\nizontal lineslocalizedin frequency,whereasthe attackso f\nthe notes and the percussive sounds will generate vertical\nlineslocalized in time. Ideally,this structureshouldbe r e-\nÔ¨Çectedinthesignaldecomposition. Thisiswhywearein-\nterested in Ô¨Ånding a signal approximation that is not only\nsparse, but also structured. Previous approaches that use\nunstructured priors, such as Bernoulli models have shown\n687Poster Session 6\nthat they generate isolated coefÔ¨Åcients with high ampli-\ntude in both bases [7,14]. These componentsdo not have\nany musical meaning and are usually perceived as ‚Äúmusi-\ncal artifacts‚Äù or ‚Äúmusical noise‚Äù in the reconstructed sig-\nnal. ConsideringdependenciesbetweenatomscoefÔ¨Åcients\nand using structuredpriors allows reducing the numberof\nsuch undesirable components. Various approaches have\nbeen proposed for introducing dependencies between co-\nefÔ¨Åcients in the time-frequency domain. Structures can\nbemodeleddirectlyinthecoefÔ¨Åcientsthemselves,suchas\nin[13]. However,dependenciesareoftenintroducedinthe\ntime-frequency indices, rather than directly in the coefÔ¨Å-\ncients themselves. Amongexisting approaches,frequency\npersistencypropertiesofthetransientlayercanbemodele d\nusing structuredBernouilli models[14]; persistencyalon g\nthe frequency axis is favored using Markov models [17];\nin [8], structural constraints on the coefÔ¨Åcients that rely\non physical properties of the signal are imposed for both\nlayers, using two types of Markov chains. It results in a\n‚Äúhorizontal structure‚Äù for the tonal layer and a ‚Äúvertical\nstructure‚Äù for the transient layer. Up to now, additional\nstructure constraints that have been added rely on physi-\ncal propertiesof the signal. The originality of our work is\nthatweproposetoincorporatepriorsthatarebasedonmu-\nsical information. Relying on the model presented in [8]\nwithinaBayesianframework,webuildastructuredmodel\nfor sparse signal decomposition that incorporates musical\npriors for tonal layer modeling. Our model is particularly\nwell adapted to the tonal structure of signals and Ô¨Åts the\nintrinsicnatureofWestern tonalmusic.\nSparse representations of signals have recently proved\nto be useful fora wide rangeof applicationsin signal pro-\ncessing,suchasdenoising[6],codingandcompression[3,\n20]orsourceseparation[7].

Let us assume that we know\nthe score corresponding to the musical excerpt and that,\nfor each frame q‚àà {1, . . ., n ton}, we know which notes\nthesignal iscomposedof.\nHere, we want to work directlyon audio. However,the\nsymbolic transcription (the score) of a piece of music is\nnotalwaysavailable,especiallyinmusicssuchasjazzmu-\nsic wherethereisa largepartdevotedto improvisation. In\naddition,algorithmsthatextractatranscriptionfromana u-\ndiosignal,suchasmulti-f0estimationalgorithms[24],ar e\nstill limitedandcostly. However,numbersofrecentworks\nhave shown that it is possible to accurately extract robust\nmid-level representation of the music, such as the chord\nprogression[18].\nWeproposetogiveamusicalpriortotheindicatorvari-\nables using musical information obtained from the chord\nprogression. The output of a chord estimation algorithm\nconsists in a progression of chords chosen among a given\nchord lexicon. Each chord may be characterized by the\nsemitone pitch classes or chroma that correspond to the\nnotes it is composed of. Since their introduction in 1999,\nPitch Class ProÔ¨Åles [10] orchroma-based representations\n[23]havebecomecommonfeaturesforestimatingchords.\nThey are traditionally 12-dimensional vectors, with each\ndimension corresponding to the intensity associated with\noneofthe12semitonepitchclasses(chroma)oftheWest-\nerntonalmusicscale,regardlessofoctave. Thesuccession\nofchromavectorsovertimeisknownas chromagram .\nIn general, the chord lexicon does not distinguish be-\ntweenanypossiblecombinationofsimultaneousnotesbut\nis typically reducedto a set of chordsof 3 or 4 notes. The\nnumberof notescomposingthe chordswill be denotedby\nNcin the following. Here, we limit our chord lexicon to\nthe24major and minor triads ( Nc= 3). The method we\nproposecouldbeextendedto largerdictionaries.\nThe chord progression does not provide an exact tran-\nscription of the music. For instance, passing notes are\nin general ignored, missing notes in the harmony may be\nadded. Moreover, the chords are estimated regardless of\noctave. However,experimentsshow that theprovidedmu-\nsical information is sufÔ¨Åcient enough to build musically\nmeaningfulpriors.\nGiven a Ô¨Åxed frame index q, let{pc\nk}k=1,...,N cdenote\nthe semitone pitch-classes (chroma) corresponding to the\nestimated chord cq.

In practice, the value ptonwill be close to\n1(in our experiments, pton= 0.9) so that atoms corre-\nsponding to the notes that are played are given high prior.\nThe signiÔ¨Åcant map for the tonal layer corresponding to\ntheGlockenspiel audio signals of our test-set is illustrated\nin Fig. 1.

RESULTS ANDDISCUSSION\nThe aim of this section is to analyze the performances of\ntheproposedapproachforthetaskofaudiodenoising. For\nthe sake of simplicity, we Ô¨Årst focusin details on a mono-\nphonic signal, the Glockenspiel . We also provide addi-\ntional numerical results and examples on short extracts of\npolyphonic music. The impact of the various parameters\n(tuning,harmonics,andpriorssettings)isalso studied.\n4.1 ExperimentalSetup\nIn this article, we present results assuming that the tran-\nscriptionisknown(notesforthemonophonicsignal,chords\nfor the polyphonic signals).

CONCLUSIONAND FUTUREWORKS\nIn this article, we have presented a method for sparse de-\ncomposition of audio signals of music on overcomplete\ndictionaries made as union of two MDCT bases. We rely\nonpreviousworksthatconsiderdependenciesbetweensig-\nniÔ¨Åcant coefÔ¨Åcients of the expansion. The originality of\nour approach is that we incorporate musical priors in the\nmodel. Our approach provides results whose quality cor-\nresponds to state-of-the-art approaches for the denoising\ntask, and which show that our model that is adequate to\nfairly represent audio signals of music. The main contri-\nbutionofthearticleistoshowthatthemusicalpriorbased\non musical knowledge performs as well as more sophisti-\ncate prioras HMM and appearsto be more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. The\nsigniÔ¨Åcancemapcorrespondingtothetonallayeriscoher-\nentwith theintrinsiccontentofmusicaudio.\nFuturework will concentrateonfully integratingin the\nmodelchordestimationinaninteractivefashion. Thechro-\nmagramcouldbeupdatedwiththeotherparametersduring\nMCMC inference in order to possibly improve the chord\nestimation. The prior we propose has a great potential of\nimprovement in the future (for example, by using a time\nsegmentation,a largerchordlexiconetc.)\nAsfarasweknow,theintroductionofmusicalpriorsin\nhybrid models for spare decomposition is novel. The use\nof mid-levelrepresentationof audio- such as the chroma-\ngram, as proposed in this paper - or scores, if available,\ncouldbeextendedtomanyapplicationssuchasdenoising,source separation, compression, coding and many others.\nUsually, only physicaland mathematical criteria are taken\ninto account. We believe that the use of musical informa-\ntionopensnewinterestingperspectives.\n6. ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authorswould like to thank C.

In contrast to audio, suc h\nscore-like representations allow music tobe searched, com -\npared, transformed, and analyzed in many ways, as with\ntext data. The need for these libraries is particularly acut e\nfor ‚Äúclassical‚Äù music, where the symbolic score has been\nregarded, at least historically, as the deÔ¨Ånitive source of a\ncomposition. We believe the most promising pathway to\nlarge-scale symbolic music libraries is through optical mu -\nsicrecognition(OMR).ThepotentialforOMRhasincreased\ndramatically with the rapid rise of the International Music\nScore Library Project (IMSLP), an open library of primar-\nily scanned, public domain, machine-printed mostly classi -\ncal music scores. The IMSLP represents a potential gold\nmineof symbolic music data, virtually imploring our com-\nmunity to develop OMR technology capable of harvesting\nthesedata.

Many envision future ‚Äúdigital music stands‚Äù based\non tablet computers. Fueled by symbolic music represen-\ntations, such devices could support a wide range of appli-\ncations in addition to the basic presentation of music, in-\ncludingpedagogicalsystemsofferingperformanceanalysi s,\nregistration of scores with music audio and video, musical\naccompanimentsystems,automaticÔ¨Ångeringsystems,nota-\ntion, automatic arranging and transcription programs. Sym -\nbolic music forms the basis of many ISMIR foci, such as\nmusic information retrieval as well as harmonic, motivic,\nstructural,andSchenkerianmusicanalyses. And,ofcourse ,\nlarge-scale symbolic music collections will be transforma -\ntive for music libraries, allowing universal access to publ ic\ndomain music.\nOMR has seen various research efforts over the last sev-\neral decades, such as [2] [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9], [8] to\nnameonlyafew. Fujinaga[1]givesarathercompletebibli-\nographyofmorethan500differentpapers,theses,andtech-\nnical reports. Given the importance of this problem, we be-\nlieveithasbeenunderrepresentedintheISMIRcommunity,\nperhaps due to the many difÔ¨Åculties of deÔ¨Åningthe prob-\nlem, such as stating goals, scope, and evaluation metrics\nthat are relevant to in vivorecognition situations. Our work\ndiffers from most the we know in OMR, through its ori-\nentation toward model-based top-down recognition. These\nideas have some precursors in OMR, such as [9], which in-\ntroduces Markov Source Models to OMR and performs a\nproofofconceptinasimpliÔ¨Åeddomain,and[8],whichalso\narguesformodel-drivenrecognition,evenoftheexperimen -\ntal aspect remains undeveloped. Model-based approaches\nare, of course, commonplace in the larger document recog-\nnitioncommunity,aswellasincomputervision,thoughthe\nconnectionsherearebeyondthescopeofourpresenteffort.\nThe state of OMR remains somewhat undeveloped, es-\npecially when compared to its optical character recognitio n\n(OCR) cousin, simply because OMR is much harder. The\nmost powerful ideas from the OCR literature are the one-\ndimensional modeling and processing techniques, such as\nhidden Markov models (HMM) and dynamic programming\n(DP), in recognizing lines of text. These techniques allow\nfor Ô¨Çexible top-down modeling, training, and computation\nto be integrated into the same framework. DP- and HMM-\n305Oral Session 3: Symbolic Music, OMR\nbasedapproachesallow simultaneous segmentationandrecog-\nnition, in which symbols are segmented notthrough local\ntopology, but by Ô¨Ånding divisions that allow the pieces to\nbe identiÔ¨Åed as meaningful ‚Äústand-alone‚Äù quantities. It is\ndifÔ¨Åcult to apply these ideas to OMR due to the fundamen-\ntallytwo-dimensional layout ofprintedmusic. Instead, pa st\napproaches have primarily worked bottom-up , usually per-\nformingcrucialimagesegmentation beforerecognition,and\noften in peril of constructing meaningless recognition hy-\npotheses, (e.g. Ô¨Ånding ‚Äúorphan‚Äù accidentals that do not be-\nlong tonote heads).\nOur approach compromises between our idealistic zeal\nfor top-down recognition and the computational and practi-\ncal demands of the challenging problem at hand. We be-\ngin by identifying page structure as described in Section\n2.2. Our main focus is the recognition of the individual\nmeasures identiÔ¨Åed through the page structure decomposi-\ntion. Weemploy model-based recognition fortheimportant\n‚Äúcompositesymbol‚Äùsub-problems: isolatedchords(Sectio n\n2.3.1) and beamed groups (Section 2.3.2). This guarantees\nthattheexampleswerecognizemakesyntacticsenseandare\n‚Äúoptimal‚Äù in some limited sense. We aggregate these over-\nlapping and conÔ¨Çicting candidates into measure hypotheses\ninSection2.3.3,throughanoptimizationproblemthatseek s\nmeaningful non-overlapping ‚Äúversions‚Äù of the recognized\nmeasure components through constrained optimization.\n2. SCIENTIFIC APPROACH\n2.1 The Data Model\nAt a conceptual level nearly all music notation is binary,\nwith each image location, x, either‚Äúblack‚Äù (containing ink)\nor ‚Äúwhite‚Äù (no ink). Of course this binary nature is only\napproximately captured by the actual pixel intensity values,\ng(x). Inpractice,thedistributionofintensityvaluesisnearl y\nalways bimodal, but often containing values that could be-\nlong to either category. We model these intensities proba-\nbilistically, with pBandpWthe black and white pixel dis-\ntributions.\nA recognition hypothesis, such as the identiÔ¨Åcation of a\nsingle symbol, partitions the image domain into three sub-\nsets: the locations assumed to black, B; a small ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù of\npresumably white pixels surrounding the black pixels, W,\naccountingfortheseparationofsymbols;andtheremaining\nlocations which have not yet been considered, U.

We Ô¨Ånd this representation by Ô¨Årst identify -\ning staves and then grouping the staves into systems using\nthe common bar line positions exhibited in a system. The\nsystems and measures are identiÔ¨Åed by Ô¨Årst Ô¨Ånding the best\nconÔ¨Åguration of shared bar lines for each potential system,\nandthenidentifyingthebestpartitionofstavesintosyste ms,\nboth using DP. This approach is phrased as an optimization\nof Eqn. , essentially seeking the conÔ¨Åguration of bar lines\nand systems that explains the maximal amount of black in\ntheimage. Weomitthedetailsofourapproachbecausethis\nislikely theleast challenging aspect of OMR, whileourap-\nproach has similaritieswithanumberof others.\n2.3 Measure Recognition\nMeasures are composed of two kinds of symbols we call\nrigidandcomposite . Rigidsymbols,suchasrestsandclefs,\nconsistofasingleglyphofknownscale,whosepossiblelo-\ncations may have partial constraints (e.g. the vertical po-\nsition of most clefs and rests). In contrast, the compos-\nitesymbols,mostimportantlychords(includingsingle-no te\n‚Äúchords‚Äù) andbeamed groups, arecomposed ofhighlycon-\nstrainedarrangementsofprimitivesymbols(noteheads,le d-\nger lines, stems, Ô¨Çags, beams, accidentals, augmentation\n30612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndotsetc.). Whentherigidandcompositesymbolscanbeor-\nderedleft-to-rightinameasure(e.g.amonophonicorhomo-\nphonic line), almost anyordering of symbols makes sense,\nas long as the time signature constraint is obeyed. As a\nconsequence, it seems that a generative model for the mea-\nsure symbols, such as a Ô¨Ånite-state machine, is not likely\nto be powerful or useful. In contrast, chords and beamed\ngroups are natural candidates for top-down model-based,\nÔ¨Ånite-state-machine-directedrecognition. Theresultis ahy-\nbrid approach to measure recognition, combining both top-\ndown and bottom-up approaches.\nWe begin by identifying candidates for the composite\nsymbols: potentialbeamcornersforthebeamedgroupsand\npotential stem beginnings for the chords. These candidates\nareexploredthroughprincipledmodel-basedrecognitions tra-\ntegies, as described in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

In\nÔ¨Ånding these oriented candidates we err on the side of false\npositives,sincestemsofisolatedchordsmissedatthissta ge\ncan never be recovered. We now discuss how we identify\nthe best chord beginning from one of these candidate loca-\ntions. If the score, (Eqn. 2.2), of this best chord is less tha n\n0, we donot considerthecandidate further.\nA chord arranges a collection of note heads on a stem,\ndrawing ledger lines for the notes lying off the staff, with\nthe constraint that note heads on the same side of the stem\nmust differ by at least one staff line or staff space. Figure 1\nshowsagenerativemodelforthesomewhatsimplerscenario\nin which the chord is known to be stem-up, there are no\nnotesbelowthestaff,andallnoteheadsareontherightside\nof the stem.

These two\nsequencesmustsatisfyseveralconstraints. Forinstance, the\ninitial stem must exceed some minimum length, thus con-\nstraining the associated interval. Furthermore, we knowthe\nlocation of the staff lines, so each state corresponding to a\nnote head or space on the staff must be associated with an\ninterval that spans the correct region.

Such a situation could arise, for\ninstance, when the single note on the right tries to explain\nthe rightmost note head of the beamed group as an acciden-\ntal. We resolve this conÔ¨Çict by running the two recognizers\nagain, now disallowing the use of Cin their recognized re-\nsults. Such constraints are simple to incorporate into our\nrecognizers, and come with little additional cost over the\ninitial computation. Suppose that s1ands2are the uncon-\nstrained scores of the two recognizers, while s‚Ä≤\n1ands‚Ä≤\n2are\nthe constrained scores. Here we choose max(s1+s‚Ä≤\n2,s‚Ä≤\n1+\ns2)asouroptimalscore,thusallocatingthecontestedregion\ntothe betterÔ¨Åtting jointmodel.\nThis general idea applies equally well to more complex\nsituations, as in the right panel of Figure 3, showing sev-\neralregions of conÔ¨Çict. Here we view the network of con-\nÔ¨Çicts as a graph, with the recognized regions representing\nnodesand the conÔ¨Çicts as edges. When this graph structure\nis a tree, we can still compute the optimal assignment of\nthe contested regions to the original hypotheses, thus pro-\nducing a non-overlapping joint hypothesis. To do this, we\nrecognize each region subject to all possible conÔ¨Çict sub-\nsets. Thus, for example, the 3 conÔ¨Çicts involving region B\nin Figure 3 would require 8 possible constrained solutions.\nWith the constrained solutions in place, it is a simple mat-\nter to optimally allocate the regions of conÔ¨Çict to the origi -\nnalhypothesesusingfamiliar‚Äúmaxpropagation‚Äùideasfrom\ngraphical models. In fact, this approach can be extended to\ngraphs containing cycles by an appropriate triangulation o f\nthegraph,ortosituationswherethemorethantwohypothe-\nses claim aregion.\nThis notion of conÔ¨Çict resolution also plays a role in our\nrecognition of beamed groups. After having recognized a\nbeamed group in the manner of Section 2.3.2, we proceedtolookforbothaccidentalsandaugmentationdotsthat‚Äúbe-\nlong‚Äù to the identiÔ¨Åed note heads. Frequently, this intro-\nduces conÔ¨Çicts into the result when these note head ‚Äúdeco-\nrations‚Äù overlap each other or previously recognized parts\nof the beamed group. In such a case, it is possible foreither\nthe newly recognized decoration, or the original interpret a-\ntionoftheconÔ¨Çictregiontobecorrect. Weresolvesuchsit-\nuations though pairwise conÔ¨Çict resolution, performing th e\nentire recognition of beamed group and decorations subject\nto constraints that ‚Äúallocate‚Äù the region of conÔ¨Çict. We re-\nsolve conÔ¨Çicts sequentially, moving left to right in the rec -\nognized structure. While the result is not optimal, at least i t\nprovides an interpretation that obeys the grammatical con-\nstraintsofthebeamedgroupandensuresthatallrecognized\ndecorations belong torecognized note heads.\n3.

INTRODUCTION\nFor the past decade, digital music collections have been grow-\ning enormously in volume, due to advances in technologies,\nsuch as storage capacity, network transmission, data com-\npression, information retrieval, etc. The rapid rise in music\ndownloading has created a major shift in the music indus-\ntry away from physical media formats to electronic distri-\nbutions. Large on-line music providers now offer millions\nof music catalogs. At present, these catalogs are commonly\nclassiÔ¨Åed and accessed through textual meta-data , such as\ngenre ,style,mood ,artist , etc. This classiÔ¨Åcation scheme\nis referred to as music tag annotation and relies on human\nexperts as well as amateurs to annotate the music [18].\nWhile this meta-data is rich and descriptive, it is difÔ¨Åcult\nto maintain and in many cases is not comprehensive, due\nto the ambiguity and subjectivity that is introduced in the\nannotation process [7]. Moreover, annotation by human ex-\nperts is an involved process, in terms of Ô¨Ånancial and labor\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.costs [4]. Therefore, manual annotation is insufÔ¨Åcient and\nineffective when facing large volumes of music. In Music\nInformation Retrieval (MIR), automatic music tag annota-\ntion is an emerging area that aims to help automate the anno-\ntation process. The task of music tag annotation can be de-\nÔ¨Åned as follows [6]. Given a set of tags T={t1, t2, ..., t A}\nand a set of music pieces M={m1, m2, ..., m R}, pre-\ndict for each music piece mj‚ààMa tag annotation vector\nA= (a1, a2, ..., a A), where ai>0if tag tihas been as-\nsociated with the piece, and ai= 0, otherwise. These ai\ndescribe the strength of the semantic associations between\ntags and the music piece and are typically referred to as se-\nmantic weights . Although these weights can be valuable in\nsome applications, we focus on the binary association where\na tag is either relevant to a music piece or not, i.e., its weight\nis mapped to{0,1}and can be interpreted as a class label. It\nis easy to see that a music piece can have multiple tags and\ntherefore music tag annotation can be modeled as a multi-\nlabel classiÔ¨Åcation process [6].\nIn our work, we study the problem of automatic mu-\nsic tag annotation by attempting to learn a relationship be-\ntween acoustic features and music tags. We conduct a se-\nries of experiments on a set of multi-label classiÔ¨Åers which\nhave shown promising results in other application domains\nincluding document classiÔ¨Åcation, video annotation, func-\ntional genomics, etc. We demonstrate which classiÔ¨Åers are\nmore suitable for music tag annotation using a set of eval-\nuation measures. While some of these classiÔ¨Åers have been\nused for multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation of music into emotions [13]\nand genres [9], we believe that it would be beneÔ¨Åcial to ex-\nplore their application in music tag annotation.\n2. RELATED WORK\nAutomatic music tag annotation is an important problem in\nMIR with numerous applications, including music search,\nrecommendation, organization, etc. It has received consid-\nerable attention as of recently and many related techniques\nhave been proposed. One of the most important contribu-\n717Poster Session 6\ntions to the problem is the work of Turnbull et al. [16], who\npropose, along with a dataset called CAL500 , one of the Ô¨Årst\ntag annotation systems based on a generative probabilistic\nmodel. This dataset has become a de facto benchmark for\nevaluating the performance of music tag annotation systems.\nHoffman et al. [5] present another probabilistic model,\nreferred to as the Codeword Bernoulli Average , which at-\ntempts to predict the probability that a tag applies to a music\npiece. It is claimed that this model outperforms the one from\nTurnbull et al. [16] on the CAL500 dataset. In addition,\nBertin-Mahieux et al. [2] propose Autotagger , a model that\nuses advanced ensemble learning schemes to combine the\ndiscriminative power of different classiÔ¨Åers. Ness et al. [6]\ndescribe how stacked generalization of the probabilistic out-\nputs of a Support Vector Machine (SVM ) can be used to im-\nprove the performance of automatic tag annotation.\nMore recently, Shen et al. [11] propose a framework called\nMMTagger that combines advanced feature extraction tech-\nniques and high-level semantic concept modeling for mu-\nsic tag annotation. The proposed framework uses a mul-\ntilayer architecture that gathers multiple Gaussian mixture\nmodels and SVMs. In addition, Zhao et al. [21] introduce a\nlarge-scale music tag recommender using Explicit Multiple\nAttributes based on tag semantic similarity and music con-\ntent. Experiment results in the work show that the proposed\nrecommender is more effective than existing ones and is at\nleast as effective as other SVM-based approaches.\n3. MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION\nDifferent from traditional single-label classiÔ¨Åcation where\neach object belongs to only one class, multi-label classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion deals with the problem where an object may belong to\none or multiple classes simultaneously, i.e., objects are as-\nsociated with a set of labels Y‚äÜL, where L(|L|>1) is a\nset of disjoint class labels [14].\nIn our work, we evaluate the following multi-label classi-\nÔ¨Åers for tag annotation. Random k-Labelsets (RAkEL),Cal-\nibrated Label Ranking (CLR),Multi-label k-Nearest Neigh-\nbor(MLkNN),Backpropagation for Multi-Label Learning\n(BPMLL ),Hierarchy of Multi-label ClassiÔ¨Åers (HOMER ),\nInstance Based Logistic Regression (IBLR ), and an adapta-\ntion of kNNusing Binary Relevance ( BRkNN). Moreover,\nwe use a Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine\n(SVM ) as base-level learning algorithms for CLR, RA kEL,\nand HOMER. A total of 10 multi-label classiÔ¨Åers are eval-\nuated. For the sake of space and due to the nature of our\nwork, we will not digress into the details of these classiÔ¨Åers.\nThe interested reader is referred to [3, 12, 14, 15, 19].\nIn order to evaluate the performance of multi-label clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers, a variety of evaluation measures are typically em-\nployed. However, as automatic music tag classiÔ¨Åcation is\nrelatively new in MIR, the evaluation measures used varysigniÔ¨Åcantly. Furthermore, different classiÔ¨Åers may perform\nbetter under different evaluation measures. Therefore, it is\ndesirable that multiple and contrasting evaluation measures\nare used in any multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation experiment. We\nmake use of the following measures which are commonly\nused in the multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation literature: Hamming\nLoss (HL),Average Precision (AP),Coverage (CO),Rank-\ning Loss (RL),One-Error (OE),Macro F-Measure (F1),Macro\nPrecision (Precision ), and Macro Recall (Recall ). The inter-\nested reader is referred to [14, 20] for details on them.\n4. EXPERIMENT SETUP\nIn our experiments, the Mulan1open source library for multi-\nlabel learning is used to train and evaluate each of the 10\nclassiÔ¨Åers using default parameters, e.g., the number of neigh-\nbors is set to 10 for MLkNN andIBLR , a linear kernel is\nused to train the SVM.\n4.1 Dataset Selection\nOur experiments are conducted on two publicly available\ndatasets. The Computer Audition Lab 500 dataset ( CAL500 )\n[16] is a collection of 500 Western songs recorded by 500\ndifferent artists. Each song is manually annotated with a\nsubset of 174 tags, which are distributed across 6 attributes:\nMood, Genre, Instrument, Song, Usage, and V ocal. All tags\nare manually generated under controlled experimental con-\nditions and are therefore believed to be of high quality. For\nour experiments, we use the ‚Äúhard‚Äù annotations provided\nwith the CAL500 dataset which gives a binary value for all\nsongs and tags indicating whether a tag applies to a song.\nMagnatagatune is a collection of approximately 21,000\nclips of music, each annotated with a combination of 188\ndifferent tags. The annotations are collected through an on-\nline game, referred to as ‚ÄúTagATune‚Äù, developed to collect\ntags for music and sound clips. Each clip, 29 seconds in\nlength, is an excerpt of music provided by Magnatune.com\nand FreeSound.org. All of the tags in the collection have\nbeen veriÔ¨Åed, i.e. a tag is associated with a clip only if it is\ngenerated independently by more than two players. More-\nover, only those tags that are associated with more than 50\nclips are included in the collection. As discussed by Seyer-\nlehner et al. [10], Magnatagatune is rather difÔ¨Åcult to handle\ndue to its size and skewed tag distribution and and has not\nbeen used as widely as CAL500.\n4.2 Feature Sets and Extraction\nPrior to classiÔ¨Åcation, the music pieces must be parameter-\nized based on a set of features and their changes over time.\nHowever, it is widely known that there is no accepted cri-\nteria as which features are best for music classiÔ¨Åcation [1].\n1http://mulan.sourceforge.net.\n71812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTherefore, we experiment with three different feature sets,\nto be described below, which are commonly used for music\nclassiÔ¨Åcation. The Marsyas2audio processing framework\nis used for the computation of the features.\nTheSpectral feature set, denoted FSs, consists of spectral\nfeatures, including Spectral Flatness Measure, Spectral Cen-\ntroid, Spectral Crest Factor, Spectral Rolloff and Spectral\nFlux.\nTheTimbral feature set, denoted FSt, consists of a combi-\nnation of spectral, temporal and cepstral features. The fol-\nlowing features are included: Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral\nCentroid, Spectral Rolloff, Spectral Flux, MFCC, Chroma.\nTheBeat feature set, denoted FSb, extends FStby includ-\ning rhythmic features that are derived by extracting periodic\nchanges from a beat histogram.\nFollowing a general practice in MIR [8], we model the\naudio signal as the statistical distribution of audio features\ncomputed on individual, short segments. This process yields\na large number of feature vectors. Therefore, the feature\nvectors are then aggregated together using statistical meth-\nods. Although more elaborate representations have been\nproposed in the literature, the simplicity of using a single\nvector for classiÔ¨Åcation is appealing [6]. Frame-level fea-\ntures in our experiment are compressed into a single set of\nsong-level features by computing the mean and standard de-\nviation across the feature vectors [6]. Furthermore, we in-\nvestigate the effects of frame size on multi-label classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion. For each <feature set ,classiÔ¨Åer >pair, we examine the\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance as we adjust the frame size, fr,\nrepresented as the number of samples collected during a cer-\ntain time period, where fr‚àà{256,512,1024,2048,4096}\nwith a 50% frame overlap [8].\n5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nIn this section, we present the results from our experiments.\nFollowing the practices used in [2,5,16], 10-fold cross vali-\ndation is employed during the evaluation process.\n5.1 CAL500\nIn the Ô¨Årst set of experiments, we evaluate the multi-label\nclassiÔ¨Åers using the CAL500 dataset. We Ô¨Ånd that for all\nfeature sets, the Calibrated Label Ranking classiÔ¨Åer using\na Support Vector Machine, CLR SVM, outperforms the other\nclassiÔ¨Åers when fr‚àà{1024,2048,4096}. Furthermore, we\nobserve that CLR DT,BPMLL ,MLkNN andBRkNN\nalso perform well over all of the frame sizes and feature\nsets.\n2http://marsyas.sness.net.When we analyze the performance of each classiÔ¨Åer over\nthe individual frame sizes, we Ô¨Ånd it difÔ¨Åcult to select one\nthat performs well for all of the classiÔ¨Åers. More specif-\nically, we observe that the performance of each classiÔ¨Åers\nis not signiÔ¨Åcantly affected by the variation in frame size.\nDespite this, we Ô¨Ånd that CLR SVMperforms the best when\nfr= 4096 . Table 1 shows a comparison of 5 classiÔ¨Åers,\nevaluated by HL, for the three feature sets when fr= 4096 ;\nthe value following ¬±gives the standard deviation.\nNote that in the following tables, ( ‚Üì) indicates better per-\nformance when the number is smaller while ( ‚Üë) indicates\nbetter performance when the number is bigger.\nFSs FSt FSb\nCLR SVM 0.125¬±0.004 0.127¬±0.004 0.128¬±0.004\nBPMLL 0.211¬±0.009 0.218¬±0.008 0.217¬±0.010\nBRkNN 0.130¬±0.004 0.134¬±0.003 0.136¬±0.004\nRAkEL DT 0.152¬±0.003 0.153¬±0.004 0.156¬±0.004\nMLkNN 0.129¬±0.004 0.133¬±0.003 0.135¬±0.003\nTable 1 .

This is also observed for the other\nevaluation measures. Table 2 presents the performance of\nCLR SVMfor each of the feature sets as evaluated by HL, OE,\nCO, and AP; the best result for each measure is shown in\nbold face. We Ô¨Ånd that CLR SVMperforms the best, for a ma-\njority of the evaluation measures, when FSsis used. While\nspectral features have shown promising results in various\nMIR classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, the inclusion of rhythmic features\nhas been shown to increase classiÔ¨Åcation performance [17].\nFurther investigation into this result would be desirable.\nHL‚Üì OE‚Üì CO‚Üì AP‚Üë\nFSs0.125¬±0.004 0.102¬±0.037 116.7¬±2.814 0.586¬±0.016\nFSt0.127¬±0.004 0.094¬±0.047 119.7¬±3.659 0.576¬±0.014\nFSb0.128¬±0.004 0.088¬±0.035 121.6¬±4.018 0.567¬±0.013\nTable 2 .

This result is discussed\nfurther in Section 5.3.\nTable 3 reports the experiment results of the top 5 multi-\nlabel classiÔ¨Åer using FSsandfr= 4096 on CAL500. To\nmake a clearer view of the relative performance between\neach classiÔ¨Åer, a partial order ‚Äú /follows‚Äù can be deÔ¨Åned on the\nset of all classiÔ¨Åers for each evaluation measure, where A1\n719Poster Session 6\nHL‚Üì OE‚Üì CO‚Üì RL‚Üì AP‚Üë F1‚Üë Precision‚Üë Recall‚Üë\nCLR SVM 0.125¬±0.004 0.102¬±0.037 116.736¬±2.814 0.140¬±0.006 0.586¬±0.016 0.497¬±0.027 0.642¬±0.059 0.124¬±0.009\nCLR DT 0.126¬±0.003 0.106¬±0.024 117.417¬±2.970 0.143¬±0.005 0.578¬±0.014 0.445¬±0.027 0.611¬±0.039 0.124¬±0.013\nBPMLL 0.211¬±0.009 0.130¬±0.051 119.878¬±3.880 0.144¬±0.007 0.570¬±0.016 0.479¬±0.016 0.294¬±0.039 0.469¬±0.026\nBRkNN 0.130¬±0.004 0.184¬±0.054 143.503¬±2.834 0.189¬±0.008 0.534¬±0.016 0.429¬±0.017 0.543¬±0.043 0.131¬±0.011\nMLkNN 0.129¬±0.004 0.132¬±0.054 126.082¬±2.994 0.159¬±0.005 0.550¬±0.011 0.476¬±0.014 0.587¬±0.047 0.118¬±0.010\nTable 3 . ClassiÔ¨Åcation performance (mean ¬±std) on CAL500 for FSswhere fr= 4096 .\n/followsA2 means that the performance of classiÔ¨Åer A1 is statis-\ntically better than that of classiÔ¨Åer A2 on the speciÔ¨Åed mea-\nsure. Following the practice used by Zhang and Zhou [20],\na two-tailed paired t-test at 5% signiÔ¨Åcance level is used to\nperform the comparison.\nNote that the partial order ‚Äú /follows‚Äù only measures the rela-\ntive performance between two classiÔ¨Åers A1 and A2 for a\nsingle evaluation measure. It is possible that A1 performs\nbetter than A2 in terms of some measure but worse than A2\nin terms of other ones. In this case, it is hard to judge which\nclassiÔ¨Åer is superior. Therefore, in order to give an overall\nperformance assessment of a classiÔ¨Åer, a score is assigned\nto it which takes into account its relative performance with\nother classiÔ¨Åers on all evaluation measures. For each mea-\nsure, for each possible pair of classiÔ¨Åers A1 and A2, if A1\n/followsA2 holds, then A1 is rewarded by a positive score +1 and\nA2 is penalized by a negative score -1. Based on the accu-\nmulated score of each classiÔ¨Åer on all evaluation measures,\na total order ‚Äú >‚Äù is deÔ¨Åned on the set of all classiÔ¨Åers [20].\nTable 4 presents an example of this process; the accumu-\nlated score for each classiÔ¨Åer is shown in parentheses.\nMulti-label ClassiÔ¨Åer\nA1-BPMLL ; A2-CLR DT; A3-CLR SVM; A4-MLkNN\nHamming Loss A2 /followsA1, A3/followsA1, A3/followsA4, A4/followsA1\nCoverage A1 /followsA4, A2/followsA4, A3/followsA4\nRanking Loss A1 /followsA4, A2/followsA4, A3/followsA4\nAverage Precision A1 /followsA4, A2/followsA4, A3/followsA1, A3/followsA4\nTotal Order A3(6) >A2(4) >A1(-1) >A4(-9)\nTable 4 . Relative performance between four multi-label\nclassiÔ¨Åcation algorithms on the CAL500 dataset.\nThe total order of all 10 multi-label classiÔ¨Åers on CAL500\nis as follows: CLR SVM(42)> CLR DT(31)> BPMLL\n(25)> MLkNN (20)> BRkNN (-1)> RAkEL SVM(-7)\n> HOMER SVM(-9)> RAkEL DT(-13)> HOMER DT(-\n35)> IBLR (-53). It can be seen that CLR SVMoutperforms\nall the other classiÔ¨Åers on the CAL500 dataset. Furthermore,\nCLR DT,BPMLL ,MLkNN , and BRkNN demonstrate\ngood performance and outperform the remaining classiÔ¨Åers.\n5.2 Magnatagatune\nFor the second set of experiments we evaluate the classiÔ¨Åers\nusing the Magnatagatune dataset. We Ô¨Ånd that for all fea-ture sets, CLR SVMoutperforms all the other classiÔ¨Åers when\nfr‚àà { 1024,2048,4096}. Furthermore, we observe that\nCLR DT,BPMLL ,MLkNN , and BRkNN , offer com-\nparable performance over all of the frame sizes and feature\nsets.\nFSs FSt FSb\nCLR SVM 0.022¬±0.002 0.021¬±0.002 0.021¬±0.001\nBPMLL 0.073¬±0.003 0.074¬±0.002 0.022¬±0.002\nBRkNN 0.021¬±0.002 0.021¬±0.002 0.022¬±0.002\nRAkEL DT 0.023¬±0.002 0.023¬±0.001 0.023¬±0.001\nMLkNN 0.021¬±0.002 0.021¬±0.002 0.022¬±0.002\nTable 5 . Hamming Loss ( ‚Üì) of the classiÔ¨Åers for the three\nfeature sets, FSs,FSt, andFSb, when fr= 2048 .\nOnce again, it is difÔ¨Åcult to select a frame size that works\nwell for all of the classiÔ¨Åers. We observe that each classiÔ¨Åer\nperforms differently, for each feature set, over the differ-\nent frame sizes. In spite of this, CLR SVMperforms the best\nwhen fr= 2048 . Table 5 shows a comparison of 5 multi-\nlabel classiÔ¨Åers, as evaluated by HL, for the three feature\nsets when fr= 2048 . From the table, we Ô¨Ånd that HL is bet-\nter for a majority of the classiÔ¨Åers when FStis used. It can\nbe seen that HL of CLR SVMandBPMLL is better when\nFSbis used. If we extend our analysis to include additional\nevaluation measures, we Ô¨Ånd that, on average, performance\nimproves with the use of FStfor a majority of classiÔ¨Åers.\nTable 6 presents the performance of CLR SVMfor each fea-\nture set.\nHL‚Üì OE‚Üì CO‚Üì AP‚Üë\nFSs0.022¬±0.002 0.423¬±0.028 40.6¬±4.709 0.479¬±0.017\nFSt0.021¬±0.002 0.403¬±0.050 38.9¬±4.687 0.505¬±0.027\nFSb0.021¬±0.002 0.413¬±0.037 40.7¬±5.031 0.495¬±0.024\nTable 6 .

This result is observed for\nboth of the datasets. Table 8 reports the experimental results\nofCLR ,RAkEL , and HOMER on the CAL500 dataset\nusing a SVM and DT as base classiÔ¨Åers.

ClassiÔ¨Åcation performance (mean ¬±std) of CLR ,\nRAkEL , andHOMER on CAL500 using a SVM and DT\nas base classiÔ¨Åers.\nFeature Set : We Ô¨Ånd it interesting that, on average, classi-\nÔ¨Åcation using FSsandFSttends to demonstrate good per-\nformance when fr‚àà{1024,2048,4096}while using FSb\nresults in better performance when fr‚àà{256,512,1024}.\nThis might be explained by the notion that the smaller frame\ncaptures better rhythmic information over the entire music\npiece. Furthermore, a large frame may be more likely tocapture the long-term nature of the music, including melodic,\nand harmonic composition, which could lead to improved\nclassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. While we Ô¨Ånd small improvements\nin classiÔ¨Åcation performance using different frame sizes, we\nobserve large differences in performance between the best\nfeature set and worst feature set for a selection of evalua-\ntion measures and classiÔ¨Åers. For example, the performance\nofBPMLL on Magnatagatune, as evaluated by AP, varies\nfrom 0.04% using FSbto 37% using FSt. In addition, we\nÔ¨Ånd that the best classiÔ¨Åcation performance is achieved on\nCAL500 and Magnatagatune using FSsandFSt, respec-\ntively. However, it is important to note that there is no ac-\ncepted criteria as which features are best for music classi-\nÔ¨Åcation [1]. Therefore, our observation in the experiments\nreported in this work may not be conclusive.\nDatasets : For a majority of the evaluation measures, it can\nbe seen that the classiÔ¨Åers perform better on Magnatagatune,\ncompared to CAL500. For example, CLR SVMachieves a\nHamming Loss of 0.0211 on the former and 0.1247 on the\nlatter. One possible explanation for this observation is that\nthe average number of tags for each instance in Magnata-\ngatune is less than CAL500, i.e., each music piece in Mag-\nnatagatune is annotated with approximately 3 tags while each\nmusic piece in CAL500 is annotated with approximately\n26 tags. We also observe that classiÔ¨Åcation performance\nvaries for each dataset depending on individual feature sets.\nFor instance, classiÔ¨Åcation using FSsperforms the best on\nCAL500 while using FStdemonstrates the best performance\non Magnatagatune; we note that using FSsshows the worst\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance on Magnatagatune. This leads\nus to believing that the spectral features used in our exper-\niment tend to give rise to better performance over longer\npieces of music while using timbral features performs bet-\nter on shorter music. Whether this is true in general needs\nfurther investigation.\n6. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we present our initial attempts on automatic\nmusic tag annotation. In our work, we conduct a series of\nexperiments, on a set of multi-label classiÔ¨Åers, exploring\nthe effects of different feature sets and frame sizes on tag\nannotation. The results offer insight into which classiÔ¨Åers\nand features are more suitable for this task. We Ô¨Ånd that\n721Poster Session 6\nthe Calibrated Label Ranking (CLR) classiÔ¨Åer consistently\nperforms well for a selection of evaluation measures when\nusing spectral and timbral features.\nFurther investigation is needed into the selection of clas-\nsiÔ¨Åer parameters. Recall that each classiÔ¨Åer is trained using\ndefault parameters. It would be interesting to explore the in-\nÔ¨Çuence of these parameters on tag annotation performance.\nIn addition, it would be interesting and beneÔ¨Åcial to com-\npare our results to existing results in the literature based on\na set of common measures.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic structure is one of the properties which contributes to\nthe characterization of a music piece. It describes its tem-\nporal organization at a high level, by means of segments\nlabeled according to their musical content and their rela-\ntionships with one another. The automatic structural seg-\nmentation of songs is generally addressed by analyzing the\nhomogeneity and the repetitiveness of the musical content\nover time (timbre, harmony, rhythm, melody).\nRecent work [2] proposes a single-level deÔ¨Ånition of the\nstructure of a music piece based on a regularity assump-\ntion. It implies the prevalence of one (or a few) typical\nsegment duration(s) within each song, i.e.structural pulsa-\ntion period(s). Indeed, a large part of western popular music\nis built on musical patterns (rhythmic cells, chord progres-\nsions, melodies...) which show cyclic behaviors and which\nare fully or partly repeated over time. This induces some\nsort of regularity in the structure of songs.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.The present work is based on this regularity assumption\nin music. We introduce a general segmentation framework,\nwhich consists of an optimization method to Ô¨Ånd the best\nsegmentation combining the similarities and/or the contrasts\nin musical content and the regularity of the segments. An\nimplementation of this method is proposed by means of a\nViterbi algorithm.\nA similar segmental Viterbi algorithm was brieÔ¨Çy\nsketched in [10] in the context of a probabilistic model\n(segmental HMM). In this paper, we make it more explicit\nand we extend it to any type of cost function. This makes\nit possible to exploit combinations of clustering-based and\nsimilarity-matrix-based approaches and to a wider variety of\nsituations outside the probabilistic framework. We also dis-\ncuss the importance of the regularity cost in the estimation\nof the segment boundaries, and provide experimental results\nwith several choices for the two terms of the segmentation\ncost.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2\nwe present the general music segmentation method, with-\nout considering a particular musical feature or temporal\nscale. Section 3 describes its implementation by means of a\nViterbi algorithm, and discusses the expression of segmen-\ntation costs. In section 4, after brieÔ¨Çy reviewing former\nwork on music structure, we apply the proposed segmen-\ntation method to this particular problem. We then present\ntwo structural segmentation systems based on the algorithm\ndeveloped above. Section 5 evaluates the effect of the incor-\nporation of regularity constraints thanks to the evaluation of\nthese systems on the RWC popular music database [6].\n2. GENERAL APPROACH\nThis section presents a general method for the temporal\nsegmentation of music pieces, when regularity assumptions\ncan be hypothesized on the segment length. It consists of\nan optimization process where the optimal segmentation is\nsearched simultaneously considering the properties of the\ndata and the regularity of the segmentation.\nA music piece Xcan be described as a sequence of N\nfeatures{xt}1‚â§t‚â§Nalong a particular temporal scale ( e.g.\n483Poster Session 4\nframes, or beats...). We denote Xtj\nti={xt}ti‚â§t<t jthe se-\nquence of features associated to the temporal interval [ti,tj[.\nLet us deÔ¨Åne a segmentation S={sk}1‚â§k‚â§nofXas a\nsequence of nintervalssk= [tk,tk+1[, with the following\nconventions :\n‚Ä¢t1= 1<...<tk<...<tn<tn+1=N+ 1,\n‚Ä¢s0= [t0,t1[= [0,1[, for the algorithm initialization,\n‚Ä¢mk=tk+1‚àítkis the length of sk.\nWe aim at Ô¨Ånding the optimal segmentation, by minimiz-\ning a certain cost function.\nWe assume that the cost function Ccan be written as\nC(S) =n/summationdisplay\nk=1Œì(sk) (1)\nwith\nŒì(sk) = Œ¶(sk) +Œª(œÑ)Œ®(sk) +/epsilon1 (2)\nwhere\n‚Ä¢Œ¶(sk)is a content-based segmentation cost, which\ntakes low values when the sequence of features in sk\nis likely to correspond to a structural segment. This\ncost can be described according to different families\nof functions, like change detection functions or sim-\nilarity functions. It can also, for instance, be derived\nfrom a probabilistic function P(sk), as‚àílogP(sk).\n‚Ä¢Œ®(sk)is a regularity cost. We consider that the reg-\nularity of a segmentation depends on the deviation of\nthe length of its segments to a prior reference length\nœÑcalled the structural pulsation period (as a conse-\nquence, Œ®(sk)decreases as mkapproachesœÑ). Note\nthat, if the values of mkare expected to follow a par-\nticular distribution œÄ(mk)aroundœÑ,Œ®(sk)can be set\nasŒ®(sk) =‚àílog(œÄ(mk)).\n‚Ä¢Œª(œÑ)is a balance parameter between these two costs.\n‚Ä¢In practice, we add a small constant /epsilon1 >0to give a\nslight advantage to longer segments in the case where\nŒ¶andŒ®would be equivalent for several segmenta-\ntions.\n3. IMPLEMENTATION\nThis section presents an implementation of the approach\npresented above, and describes possible choices of cost\nfunctions Œ¶,Œ®and parameter Œª.\nFigure 1 .

Segmentations with lower costs are ex-\npected to consist of segments built on the same musical pat-\nterns. Different families of functions can be considered, like\nabrupt change detection criteria or similarity functions.\nAbrupt change detection criteria assign a low cost to\nsegments associated to probable boundaries. In automatic\nstructure inference, [3] uses for example a ‚Äúnovelty func-\ntion‚Äù based on the analysis of the local homogeneity of the\nsong over time.\nSimilarity functions aim to assign a low cost to segments\nmade of sequences of features repeated elsewhere in the\nsong. We can deÔ¨Åne such a function as\nŒ¶(sk) =minŒ∏‚ààZk{œÜ(Xtk+mk\ntk,XŒ∏+mk\nŒ∏)}. (3)\nThe lowest dissimilarity œÜis taken between the sequence\nof featuresXtk+mk\ntkfromsk(of lengthmk) and any other\nsequence of the same length contained in a portion ZkofX.\nIn particular, Œ¶(sk) = 0 when the sequence of features of sk\nis exactly repeated elsewhere in Zk,Œ¶(sk)>0otherwise.\nZk= [1,tk‚àímk]‚à™[tk+mk,N]can be chosen to avoid\nintra-segment comparisons. In the case of a binary dissimi-\nlarity, where a song is described as a sequence of symbolic\nfeatures, the following function can be chosen :\nœÜ(Xtk+mk\ntk,XŒ∏+mk\nŒ∏) =mk‚àí1/summationdisplay\np=01‚àíŒ¥(xtk+p,xŒ∏+p),(4)\nwhereŒ¥is Kronecker‚Äôs delta (equals 1 when arguments have\nthe same value, 0 otherwise). More generally any non-\nbinary function can be used in equation (3).\n3.2.2 Regularity cost Œ®\nThe regularity cost Œ®of a segmentation is based on the mea-\nsure of the deviation between the length of its segments from\na reference length œÑ. It can show the following properties :\n1.Œ®(œÑ) = 0 ,\n2.Œ®(mk)>0, taking higher values as the segment\nlengthmkmoves away from œÑ.\nA lot of functions can satisfy these properties. We consider\ntwo categories of functions : convex and non-convex func-\ntions. As non-convex functions verify the property :\nŒ®(œÑ) + Œ®(œÑ+ ‚àÜ)<Œ®(œÑ+ ‚àÜ 1) + Œ®(œÑ+ ‚àÜ 2) (5)\nwith\n‚àÜ = ‚àÜ 1+ ‚àÜ 2, (6)\nFigure 2 . Examples of regularity costs Œ®Œ±for\nŒ±={0.5,1,2}andœÑ= 32\n‚àÜ1>0and‚àÜ2>0 (7)\nthey favor segmentations made of fewer irregular segments.\nBy contrast, convex functions tend to favor segmentations\nwith irregularities spread across several segments.\nAs an illustration, we consider the following family of\nsymmetric functions derived from the lŒ±norm :\nŒ®Œ±(mk) =|mk\nœÑ‚àí1|Œ±(8)\nmkis the length of interval sk, andŒ±controls the convexity\nof the function (we have a non-convex function if 0<Œ±<\n1, and a convex one if Œ±‚â•1). Figure 2 shows Œ®Œ±for\nŒ±={0.5,1,2}.\n3.3 Balance parameter Œª\nWe consider that Œªdepends onœÑas the probability of having\nirregular segments grows with the number of segments, and\ntherefore with the inverse of œÑ. We choose the linear relation\nŒª(œÑ) =ŒªœÑ, whereŒªis a constant parameter to be tuned.\n4. APPLICATION TO THE STRUCTURAL\nSEGMENTATION OF SONGS\nThe work presented in section 3 is primarily intended to the\nstructural segmentation of songs. Automatic music structure\ninference is a difÔ¨Åcult task, because the problem to be solved\nis usually ill-posed. Moreover, it requires the analysis and\nthe complex combination of features and criteria through the\ndevelopment of sophisticated metrics and algorithms. In this\nsection, we review brieÔ¨Çy the main state-of-the-art methods\nfor automatic structural segmentation of songs, before de-\nscribing two structural segmentation systems implemented\nfrom the proposed method.\n4.1 State-of-the-art\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to the problem of\nautomatic structure inference. They generally use acous-\ntic features, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients\n(MFCCs) and Chroma vectors, which characterize the in-\nstrumental timbre and the harmonic content respectively.\nOther features are described in [17], [1], and [8]. Struc-\ntural segments are assumed to show stable instrumentation\n485Poster Session 4\n(often associated to homogeneous timbre) and therefore to\nappear as blocks with speciÔ¨Åc textures in similarity matri-\nces [3,12], or sequences of similar states in Hidden Markov\nModels (HMMs) [11].\nRepeated harmonic progressions can be detected by lo-\ncalizing the sequences of high similarity coefÔ¨Åcients in sub-\ndiagonals of the chroma-based similarity matrix [4]. Other\napproaches, like HMMs [10,14], or more recently Non neg-\native Matrix Factorization [20] are also used for the recogni-\ntion of repeated harmonic patterns. Some methods use dy-\nnamic programming : Shiu et al. interpret the chroma-based\nsimilarity matrix as a time-state representation and use the\nViterbi algorithm to Ô¨Ånd the path with the highest score in\nterms of similarity through it [15]. A constraint is set to give\npriority to the diagonal direction for the path, and implicitly\ninÔ¨Çuence the length of the estimated structural segments.\nSome other approaches combine these content-based\nmethods by means of optimization problems, as in [8, 12].\nA more detailed state of the art is available in [13].\nIn the following section, we present two systems that in-\nfer the structural segmentation of a song, incorporating the\nidea of ‚Äùstructural pulsation period‚Äù2.\n4.2 Presentation of the systems\nThese systems perform a structural segmentation of songs\ncombining content-based segmentation under a regularity\nconstraint by means of the Viterbi algorithm presented in\nsection 3.1. System 1 uses acoustic features to compute\nchange detection criteria and estimates the main structural\npulsation period œÑfrom the audio. System 2 analyzes sym-\nbolic features, uses a similarity function and prior knowl-\nedge ofœÑ(Ô¨Åxed at 32 beats). As features are considered\nat the beat scale, a beat detection system is needed. We\nevaluate for these 2 systems the impact of incorporating a\nregularity constraint on the relative performance of the seg-\nmentation.\n4.2.1 System 1 : combination of change detection criteria\non acoustic features\nThe system we consider is the one described in [16]. In\nthis paper, we consider variants of this system both with\nand without the regularity constraint in order to analyze its\nimpact on structural segmentation inference. The content-\nbased segmentation cost is based on 3 statistical criteria\nwhich measure for each temporal index the likelihood ratio\nof a structural segment boundary. This criterion combines\ninstrumental changes, short events and contrastive patterns\nover time.\nThe criteria are combined in a weighted sum to form\nwhat we name here the content-based segmentation cost. A\n2This can be seen as a way to constrain the ill-posed problem of struc-\ntural segmentation towards a well-deÔ¨Åned solution.linear regularity cost function is used to perform the Viterbi\napproach described in section 3.1, to Ô¨Ånd the segmentation\nwith lowest cost. The main structural pulsation period of the\nsong is estimated by a Fourier transform on the instrumental\nchange criterion.\n4.2.2 System 2 : similarity function on symbolic features\nIt is interesting to consider symbolic features for structure\ninference as other means of music description. The joint\nuse of various features in a global and versatile retrieval sys-\ntem may increase the accuracy of the estimated segmenta-\ntion [19]. The symbols can be obtained for instance from a\nscore of the piece. System 2 uses chords estimations to com-\npute the similarity function described with the equations (3)\nand (4) of section 3.2.1. Each chord class is associated to a\ndifferent symbol, to obtain a quite neutral symbolic descrip-\ntion of the song. The size of the alphabet of symbols we use\nis the number of chord classes used by the chord estimator\n(e.g.24 classes for major and minor chords). Each symbol\ncorresponds to a duration of 2 beats, in order to be consistent\nwith the temporal scale used in [2].\nThe structural pulsation period value œÑis considered as\nprior knowledge and used in the regularity cost Œ®Œ±of equa-\ntion (8), section 3.2.2. The content-based cost and the reg-\nularity cost are then combined using equations (1) and (2)\nfrom section 2, and the segmentation with lower cost is\nfound using Viterbi algorithm from section 3.1.\n5. EV ALUATION\n5.1 Evaluation database\nThe algorithms have been evaluated using the RWC popular\nmusic database [6], and the set of reference annotations pro-\nvided by [2], used in MIREX 2010. This database consists\nof 100 songs written and produced for research purposes.\n5.2 Evaluation metrics\nThe evaluation of the segmentation is done by Precision ( P),\nRecall (R) and F-measure ( F) metrics. Let sRbe the set of\nreference boundaries (annotations) and sEthe set of esti-\nmated ones, they are respectively deÔ¨Åned as :\nP=|sE‚à©sR|\n|sE|;R=|sE‚à©sR|\n|sR|;F=2PR\n(P+R).(9)\nThe matching of reference and estimated boundaries is\nperformed within particular tolerance windows. We con-\nsider 0.5 s and 3 s as in MIREX 2010. Note that each bound-\nary is used only once during the matching process.\n5.3 Feature extraction and algorithm parametrization\nSystem 1 (which uses change detection criteria) uses 20\nMFCCs (including the 0th coefÔ¨Åcient), extracted from\n48612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTolerance window = 0.5 sec.\nsystemŒ±ŒªP(%)R(%)F(%)\n1 - 0 10.1 53.6 17.0\n10.5 23.9 24.3 23.8\nTolerance window = 3 sec.\nsystemŒ±ŒªP(%)R(%)F(%)\n1 - 0 16.8 89.3 28.2\n10.5 61.2 63.0 61.4\nTable 1 .

Chroma vectors (12 coefÔ¨Åcients) are extracted\nfrom frames of length 92.9 ms, and a hop size of 23.2 ms.\nChroma vectors and beats estimation are computed thanks\nto LabRosa scripts4.\nSystem 2 (based on a similarity function) inputs the\nchords transcriptions obtained by the algorithm from Ueda\net al. , described in [18], and uses the downbeat annota-\ntions available with the RWC database5. The reference\nannotations show that more than 80% of the songs have\na main structural pulsation of 32 beats. We will then use\nœÑ= 32 beats as prior knowledge for our evaluation, and\nH= 3œÑas the maximal number of admissible predecessors\nfor each temporal unit.\nA preliminary study on a subset of RWC popular was car-\nried out to identify reasonable values of Œªwhich fall within\nthe interval [0, 1]. Three values of Œ±are chosen to con-\nsider regularity costs functions with different convexities :\na non-convex regularity cost function ( Œ±= 0.5), a convex\nregularity cost function ( Œ±= 2), and the intermediate case\nŒ±= 1.\n5.4 Results\nThe values gathered in Tables 1 and 2 for System 1 and\n2 show that the overall mean F-measures increase signiÔ¨Å-\ncantly when the regularity cost is introduced.\nFigure 3 shows the average F-measure obtained with Sys-\ntem 2 for the 3 regularity costs mentioned in 5.3. The values\nofŒªcorresponding to optimal performance appear in Table\n2 for each case. The value of Œ±has an impact on the accu-\nracy of the estimated boundaries : it can be seen that, for a\nsmall tolerance, a non-convex regularity cost function gives\nbetter boundary accuracy than a convex one. This can be\nexplained by the fact previously mentioned, that the convex\ncase (Œ±= 2) tends to spread structural irregularities (devi-\n3http://www.ofai.at/elias.pampalk/ma/documentation.html\n4http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/coversongs/\n5http://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/RWC-MDB/Tolerance window = 0.5 sec.\nsystemŒ±ŒªP(%)R(%)F(%)\n2 - 0 17.9 31.9 22.0\n0.5 0.30 37.7 34.8 35.6\n1 0.30 34.7 32.3 33.0\n2 0.95 29.3 26.8 27.5\nTolerance window = 3 sec.\nsystemŒ±ŒªP(%)R(%)F(%)\n2 - 0 36.1 64.7 44.5\n0.5 0.15 63.1 63.1 62.0\n1 0.15 63.4 64.1 62.7\n2 0.60 64.5 60.0 61.2\nTable 2 .

On the contrary, the\nnon-convex case ( Œ±= 0.5) tends to concentrate them on a\nfew segments. These results therefore show not only the ad-\nvantage of the regularity constraint but also the importance\nof the Ô¨Åne properties of the corresponding cost function.\nAs a point of comparison, the best system in struc-\ntural segmentation at MIREX 20106(MND1) obtained F-\nmeasures of 35.9% and 60.5% (for tolerance windows of\n0.5 s and 3 s respectively) on the same database. Note\nhowever that System 2 relies on a manual annotation of the\ndownbeats.\n6. CONCLUSION\nThe work presented in this paper has highlighted the rele-\nvance of incorporating a regularity constraint in the task of\nstructural segmentation. Even with very basic cost func-\ntions as the ones considered in the present work, the very\nexistence of the regularity constraint favors the retrieval of\na well-deÔ¨Åned solution. The Viterbi implementation, which\nwe have detailed, allows a fast calculation of the optimal so-\nlution, and it can be applied in a generic way to any type of\ncost function.\nThe corresponding Matlab code will be made available to\nthe MIR community7for enabling further experimental in-\nvestigation within diverse structural segmentation systems\nand possibly for other tasks in MIR where the regularity\nconstraint can be meaningful.\n6http://nema.lis.illinois.edu/nema out/mirex2010/results/struct/mirex10\n/summary.html\n7http://www.irisa.fr/metiss/logiciel/\n487Poster Session 4\nFigure 3 .

MOTIVATION AND CONTEXT\nTerm weighting techniques such as TF¬∑IDFandBM25\nhavebeenusedintenselyforvarioustextretrievaltasks. A l-\nthough a wealth of approaches to model the term vector\nspace [21] on the Web has been proposed throughout the\nlast years, e.g., [6,12,20,30], IR-related research inter est\nin the relatively novel Ô¨Åeld of microblog mining has been\nratherlimitedsofar.\nMicroblogginghasencounteredaremarkablegaininpop-\nularityduringthepast coupleofyears. Beingthemostpop-\nular microblogging service, Twitter has more than 100\nmillion registered users [31]. Millions of Twitter users\npost ‚Äútweets‚Äù that reveal what they are doing, what is on\ntheirmind,orwhatiscurrentlyimportantforthem. Accord-\ning to [7], the number of tweets per day surpassed 50mil-\nlions in early 2010. Twitter thus represents a rich data\nsourcefortext-basedIEandIR.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage an d that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.The work at hand was inspired by [32], where the au-\nthors thoroughly evaluate various choices related to con-\nstructingtextfeaturevectorsforIRpurposes,e.g.,termf re-\nquency (TF), term weights ( IDF), and normalization ap-\nproaches. They analyze the inÔ¨Çuence of these decisions on\nretrieval behavior. Similarly, we present a systematic lar ge-\nscale study on the inÔ¨Çuence of a multitude of decisions on\nmusicartistsimilarityestimation,usingreal-worlddata col-\nlections. To this end, we analyze several thousand com-\nbinations of the following single aspects: term frequency,\ninverse document frequency, normalization with respect to\nlength,similarityfunction,indextermset,andquerysche me.\nElaboratingmusicalsimilarity measuresthat are capable\nofcapturingaspectsrelatingtoperceivedsimilarityison eof\nthe main challenges in MIR. Such measures enable various\nmusic applications, for example, automatic playlist gener -\nators [1], music recommender systems [4], music informa-\ntion systems [23], semantic music search engines [11], and\nintelligentuserinterfaces[17]tomusiccollections.\nSimilaritymeasuresbasedontermproÔ¨Ålesextractedfrom\nartists‚ÄôWebpageshavebeenstudiedinMIRforalongtime,\ne.g., [3,10,30]. In contrast, microblogs have not been har-\nvested to a large extent so far for this purpose. To the best\nofourknowledge,theonlyworkconsideringmicroblogsfor\nsimilaritymeasurementofmusicartistsis[24]. Theauthor s\nof the aforementionedpublications,however,usually sele ct\none (or a few) variant(s) of the TF¬∑IDFterm weight-\ning measure and apply it to documents retrieved for music\nartists. The individual choices involved in selecting a spe -\nciÔ¨ÅcTF¬∑IDFvariant and similarity function, however,\ndo not seem to be the result of detailed assessments. In the\nwork at hand, by contrast, we present a thoroughinvestiga-\ntion of several dimensions for modeling the music-related\ntermvectorspaceonthemicro-blogosphere.\n2. MODELING THEMICROBLOG\nTERM VECTOR SPACE\nSimilarly to the large scale experiments presented in [32],\nwe aim at analyzing if speciÔ¨Åc combinations of the inves-\ntigated algorithmic choices perform considerably better o r\nworsethanothers,whereperformanceismeasuredinasim-\nilarity classiÔ¨Åcation task amongtermvectorrepresentati ons\noftweets, cf.Section3.\nTable 1 contains an overview of the denominationsused in\n323Oral Session 4: Web\nDset of documents\nNnumber of documents\nfd,tnumber of occurrences of term tindocument d\nftnumber of documents containing term t\nFttotalnumber of occurrences of tinthe collection\nTdset of distinctterms indocument d\nfm\ndlargestfd,tof all terms tind\nfmlargestftinthe collection\nrd,tterm frequency (cf.Table 3)\nwtinverse document frequency (cf.Table 4)\nWddocument length of d\nTable 1. Denominations used in term weighting functions\nandsimilaritymeasures.\nthe different term weighting formulations (Tables 3 and 4)\nandsimilaritymeasures(Table5).\n2.1 QueryScheme\nWe decided to assess two schemes to query Twitter as\npreviouswork on Web-MIR [26,30]has shown that adding\nmusic-related key terms to a search request generally im-\nproves the quality of feature vectors in terms of similarity -\nbased classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. In Web-MIR, common terms\nused as additional key words are ‚Äúmusic review‚Äù or ‚Äúmu-\nsic genre style‚Äù. Taking into account the 140-character-\nlimitation of tweets, we decided to include only ‚Äúmusic‚Äù\nas additional query term ( QSM) or query without any ad-\nditional key terms, i.e., use only the artist name ( QSA) as\nexactphrase.\n2.2 Index Term Set\nEarlier work in text-based music artist modeling [9,16,29]\nshows that a crucial choice in deÔ¨Åning the representation\nof an artist is that of the used index terms. For the work\nat hand, we hence investigatedvariousterm sets, which are\nsummarizedinTable2. Set TSAcontainsalltermsfoundin\nthe corpus(after casefolding,stopping, and stemming). Se t\nTSSis the entire term dictionary of SCOWL[28], which\nis an aggregation of several spell checker dictionaries for\nvarious English languages and dialects. Set TSNencom-\npassesallartistnamespresentinthedataset. Previouswor k\nhas shown that the corresponding co-occurrence approach\nto music artist similarity estimation yields remarkable re -\nsults, cf. [26]. Term set TSDis a manually created dic-\ntionary of music-related terms that resembles the one used\nin [16]. It contains, for example, descriptors of genre, in-\nstruments, geographic locations, epochs, moods, and musi-\ncological terms. Set TSLrepresents the most popular tags\nutilized by users of last.fm . SetTSFcomprisesthe ag-\ngregated data set for the data types musical genre ,musical\ninstrument ,andemotion,extractedfrom Freebase [8].\nTo build the inverted word-level index [33], we use a\nmodiÔ¨Åed version of the open source indexer Lucene [14],\nwhichweextendedtorepresent Twitter posts. Theexten-\nsions will be made available through our CoMIRVA frame-\nwork [5,25]. When creating the indexes for the different\nterm sets, we commonly employ casefolding and stopping,e.g. [2]. Stemming, in contrast, is only performed for the\nterm sets for which it seems reasonable, i.e., for term sets\nTSAandTSS.\n2.3 TF andIDF: Term Weighting\nEven though our experimental setting is guided by Zobel\nand Moffat‚Äôs [32], we decided to extend the TF¬∑IDF\nformulationsinvestigatedbythemwith BM25-likeformula-\ntions.BM25is an alternative term weighting scheme, used\nintheOkapiframeworkfortext-basedprobabilisticretrieval\n[19]. The BM25model includes a priori class knowledge.\nSinceincorporatinggenreinformationintothetermweight -\ningfunctionwouldbiastheresultsofthegenreclassiÔ¨Åcati on\nexperiments,we includedan adaptedformulationin the ex-\nperiments, cf. variants TFGandIDFJin Tables 3 and 4,\nrespectively.\n2.4 VirtualDocumentsand Normalization\nWhencreatingatermproÔ¨ÅlefromWebpagesretrievedfora\nnamedentity(amusicartistinourcase),itiscommontoag-\ngregatethepagesassociatedwith aparticularentityto for m\na ‚Äúvirtual document‚Äù, e.g. [3,10]. This procedure not only\nfacilitates handling small or empty pages, it is also more\nintuitive since the item of interest is the entity under con-\nsideration, not a Web page. Latest work [27] further shows\nthatcalculatingtermweightsonthelevelofindividualWeb\npages before aggregating the resulting feature vector per-\nforms inferior for the task of similarity calculation than u s-\ning ‚Äúvirtual documents‚Äù.

Although genre taxonomies are often inconsistent\nand erroneous[15], it is commonplacein MIR to use genre\nas a proxy for artist similarity. The evaluated retrieval ta sk\nconsists of determining kartists similar to a given query\nartist.

TheÔ¨Årst one,referred\nto asC224a, consists of 224well-known artists and has a\nuniform genre distribution ( 14genres1,16artists each). It\nhas been frequently used to evaluate Web-/text-based MIR\napproaches.\nThe second data set C3kaconsists of 3,000music artists,\nrepresentingareal-worldcollection.

Since last.fm ‚Äôs\ndata is proneto misspellingsdueto its collaborativenatur e,\nwe cleaned the data set by matching each artist name with\nthe database of the expert-based music information system\nallmusic.com , from which we also extracted genre in-\nformation.

It is noteworthy, however, that the good\nperformanceof TSAandTSScomesat the price of much\nhighercomputationalcomplexity(cf.Table2). Hence,when\nperformanceis crucial, the results suggest using other ter m\nsets. A particularly good choice seems to be TSN, the list\nof artist names, as it is the set that most frequently occurs\namong the top-ranked variants ( 32.5%). Another interest-\ning Ô¨Ånding is that the music dictionary TSD, despite its\ngood performancefor artist clustering based on Web pages ,\ncf.[16],occursÔ¨Årst onlyat rank 1,112.

INTRODUCTION\nThe development of content-based systems for the predic-\ntion of emotion (mood) in music continues to be a topic of\nincreasing attention in the Music-IR community, but thus\nfar most approaches apply only a singular rating to a song\nor clip [1]. Such generalizations belie the time-varying na-\nture of music and make emotion-based recommendation dif-\nÔ¨Åcult, as it is very common for emotion to vary temporally\nthroughout a song.

Furthermore, the system\nprovides a model of both the relationships between acous-\ntic data and emotion space parameters and also how those\nrelationships evolve over time.\nHuman judgements are necessary for deriving emotion\nlabels and associations, but perceptions of the emotional\ncontent of a given song or musical excerpt are bound to vary\nand reÔ¨Çect some degree of disagreement between listeners.\nFollowing from our previous work, we model human emo-\ntion responses to music in the arousal-valence (A-V) repre-\nsentation of emotion [2‚Äì4], where valence indicates positive\nvs. negative emotions and arousal reÔ¨Çects emotional inten-\nsity [5]. In our prior approaches, we modeled our emotion\nspace distribution as a single two-dimensional Gaussian dis-\ntribution, and trained multivariate regression systems to pre-\ndict the parameters of the distribution directly from acoustic\nfeatures [3, 4]. Using that representation, we found model-\ning the dynamics of the continuous parameter space to be a\nvery challenging problem. We considered a Kalman Ô¨Ålter-\ning approach, but while this technique provided smooth es-\ntimates over time, the limited model complexity was unable\nto cover a wide variance in emotion space dynamics [4].\nIn applying CRFs to the problem of predicting emotion\nin music, instead of modeling the ambiguity of emotion a-\npriori and representing the distribution of our emotion space\nparameters as the ground truth, we present the training algo-\nrithm with the individual user label sequences, thus allow-\ning the model to learn the range of emotion responses to a\ngiven piece. In our application of the CRF we must also as-\nsign emotion space meanings to the states of the model, and\nin doing so we discretize each label in our sequences to an\n11√ó11grid. While this is a signiÔ¨Åcant simpliÔ¨Åcation, our\nÔ¨Åndings indicate that it provides sufÔ¨Åcient granularity. Fur-\nthermore, our trained models are fully connected, and can\n777Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\nbe used to model complex distributions in emotion as an A-\nV heatmap. These heatmaps can model arbitrary modes and\ndistributions, in contrast to our previous approach, which\nconstructed uni-modal Gaussian A-V predictions.\n2. BACKGROUND\nThe general approach to implementing automatic mood de-\ntection from audio has been to use supervised machine\nlearning to train statistical models based on acoustic fea-\ntures [1]. Chan et al. recently investigated modeling emo-\ntion as a distribution [6]. Their approach investigated mod-\neling the ground truth as a Gaussian distribution as well as a\nheatmap and used support vector regression for the distribu-\ntion prediction. However, their corpus was limited to only\n60 songs, and the work only focused on applying a singular\nrating to an entire clip.\nConditional random Ô¨Åelds have only just begun to gain\nattention as a tool for content-based audio prediction. Re-\ncently, Joder et al. successfully applied them to the task\nof audio-to-score matching, detecting more than 95% of the\nnote onset locations to within 100 ms [7].\n3. GROUND TRUTH DATA COLLECTION\nIn prior work, we developed an online collaborative annota-\ntion activity based on the two-dimensional A-V model [8].\nIn the activity, participants used a graphical interface to in-\ndicate a dynamic position within the A-V space to anno-\ntate 30-second music clips. Each subject provided a check\nagainst the other, reducing the probability of nonsense la-\nbels. The song clips used were drawn from the ‚Äúuspop2002‚Äù\ndatabase.1Using initial game data, we constructed a cor-\npus of 240 15-second music clips, which were selected to\napproximate an even distribution across the four primary\nquadrants of the A-V space.\nIn more recent work we have developed a Mechanical\nTurk (MTurk) activity to collect annotations on the same\ndataset [9]. The purpose of the MTurk activity was to pro-\nvide a dataset collected through more traditional means to\nassess the effectiveness of the game to determine any biases\ninduced though collaborative labeling. Overall, the datasets\nwere shown to be highly correlated, with arousal r=0.712,\nand a valence r=0.846. This new dataset has been made\navailable to the research community,2and is well anno-\ntated, containing 16.93¬±2.690ratings per song and 4,064\nlabel sequences. In this work we demonstrate the applica-\ntion of this densely annotated corpus for training our condi-\ntional random Ô¨Åelds.\n1http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/musicsim/uspop2002.html\n2http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/emotion/moodswingsturk3.1 Statistical Analysis\nIn applying relational learning methods to data, we gain the\nability to model statistical dependencies from one observa-\ntion to the next. To verify that our data collection exhibits\nsuch dependencies, we compute the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients\nof our label sequences from one frame to the next and from\nthe Ô¨Årst frame of each sequence to the last. In these cases,\nwe treat the individual discretized user labels as variables,\nand each second as observations of those variables. Statis-\ntics of the squared correlation coefÔ¨Åcients ( r2) are provided\nfor the full dataset in Table 1.\nDimension r2Frame-Frame r2First-Last Frame\nArousal 0.944¬±0.093 0 .507¬±0.242\nValence 0.951¬±0.097 0 .524¬±0.235\nTable 1 . Statistics of ground truth squared correlation co-\nefÔ¨Åcient (r2) from one second to the next and from the Ô¨Årst\nsecond to the last.\nOverall, the dataset shows high correlation from one\nframe to the next, and lower correlation between the Ô¨Årst\nframe and last frame. In other words, the current emotion\nis highly dependent upon the emotion of the prior second,\nand on average each sequence exhibits a signiÔ¨Åcant change\nin emotion from beginning to end. As a result, the dataset is\na good match for graphical modeling techniques.\n4. ACOUSTIC FEATURE COLLECTION\nIn previous work we have found there to be no single domi-\nnant feature, but rather many that play a role (e.g., loudness,\ntimbre, harmony) in determining the emotional content of\nmusic [2,3]. Since our experiments focus on the tracking of\nemotion over time, we chose to focus solely on time-varying\nfeatures. Our collection (Table 2) consists of the two high-\nest performing features in prior work, Spectral Contrast and\nMFCCs [2, 3], as well as the Echo Nest Timbre (ENT) fea-\ntures.\nFeature Description\nSpectral Contrast\n[10]Rough representation of the harmonic\ncontent in the frequency domain.\nMel-frequency\ncepstral coefÔ¨Åcients\n(MFCCs) [11]Low-dimensional representation of\nthe spectrum warped according to the\nmel-scale. 20 dimensions used.\nEcho Nest Timbre\nfeatures (ENTs)3Proprietary 12-dimensional beat-\nsynchronous timbre feature\nTable 2 .

CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELDS\nIn this section we give a brief overview of conditional ran-\ndom Ô¨Åelds (CRFs), mainly focused on practical considera-\ntions in implementation. The interested reader is directed\nto [12, 13] for further details.\n5.1 Overview\nTraditional approaches for graphical modeling (e.g. hid-\nden Markov models) seek to represent the joint probability\np(x,y)between sets of features xand labels y. But in forc-\ning our features into a generative model p(x)we discard\nthe rich local subtleties present in the data. Furthermore, in\ndeveloping models for audio classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, our acous-\ntic features are naturally deterministic. With CRFs, as with\nlogistic regression, we seek to model the conditional proba-\nbilityp(y|x).\nCRFs are trained on sequences, and in the process of\nlearning them we present the classiÔ¨Åcation system with the\nindividual user ratings (as opposed to statistics of all users)\nrecorded in the MTurk task. Using a fully connected model,\nwe are able to learn a set of transition probabilities from\neach class to all others. This means that at each stage in a\ntesting sequence we can display the transition probabilities\nin the form of a heatmap as shown in Figure 1.\nArousalArousalValence\nFigure 1 . Heatmap visualization of CRF transition proba-\nbilities. Actual discretization is 11√ó11.\n5.2 Feature Functions\nCRFs require the speciÔ¨Åcation of feature functions, which\nare used to specify the degree of compatibility between the\nfeatures xand labels y. These functions are deÔ¨Åned over\nall examples, and for a single example are non-zero only\nfor the labeled class. We train our CRFs using CRF++,5\na highly efÔ¨Åcient general purpose CRF toolkit written in\n4http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/\n5http://crfpp.sourceforge.net/C++. CRF++ allows the deÔ¨Ånition of both unigram and\nbigram features, where unigram features are related to the\nprediction of a single observation in a sequence (Ô¨Årst order\nMarkov) and bigram features are related to the prediction\nof pairs of observations (second order Markov). Unigram\nfeatures generate a total of L √óN distinct features, where\nL is the number of output classes and N is the number of\nunique features. Bigram features generate L √óL√óN distinct\nfeatures.\n6. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nIn the following experiments, we investigate the use of con-\nditional random Ô¨Åelds for the prediction of musical emo-\ntion. As a baseline for comparing performance of the CRF\nin modeling the time-dependencies of our data, we addi-\ntionally provide the performance for the CRF when trained\non independent observations as opposed to sequences. Fur-\nthermore, to provide a baseline for comparison to our prior\nwork [3, 4], we provide the prediction accuracy of multiple\nlinear regression (MLR). To compute the heatmap represen-\ntations for MLR, we Ô¨Årst predict the mean and covariance\nof an emotion-space Gaussian density using multivariate re-\ngression, and then integrate the probability density function\nunder each square of our heatmap.\nIn all experiments, to avoid the well-known ‚Äúalbum-\neffect,‚Äù we ensure that any songs which were recorded on\nthe same album are either placed entirely in the training\nor testing set. Additionally, each experiment is subject to\n5 cross-validations, varying the distribution of training and\ntesting data sets which are split 70%/30%, respectively.\n6.1 Acoustic Feature Representation\nAll features are initially computed using short-time analysis\nwindows at a much higher rate than our 1-second emotion\nlabel windows. In order to reduce their frame rate to that\nof the labels, spectral contrast and MFCCs are simply re-\nwindowed via averaging from their original analysis rate ( ‚àº\n23msec). The ENTs are re-windowed following their non-\nlinear analysis frame start times to take into account their\nbeat-synchronous nature.\nAdditionally, conditional random Ô¨Åelds are highly op-\ntimized to operate on binary features, and given the high\ndimensionality of our data, we found it necessary to con-\nvert our features to such a representation. In doing so, each\nfeature dimension is quantized using 10 equal energy bins,\nwhich for the 14-dimensional case of spectral contrast yields\n140 binary features. In early experiments, we investigated\nthe use of higher discretization levels as well as combining\nrepresentations from multiple discretization levels (e.g. 5,\n10, 20), but overall found 10 levels to offer the best perfor-\nmance.\n779Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\n6.2 Training Sequence Label Jittering\nIn discretizing our original label sequences to the 11√ó11\ngrid representation, our CRF models are trained on vector-\nized version of that space by assigning 121 classes. As a\nresult, the neighbor-relationship of the heatmap grid-cells is\nlost in the vector-wise representation, and we therefore in-\nvestigate how to improve the models ability to learn such\nrelationships.\nIn order to ensure that the CRF learns the spatial rela-\ntionships of each class, we train it on additional ‚Äújittered‚Äù\nversions of each label sequence. This has two beneÔ¨Åts: it\nincreases the overall size of our dataset, and it helps the\nmodel to learn the spatial relationships between the differ-\nent classes. In applying our jitter we increase the size of our\ndataset by a factor of 10, creating 9 additional sequences for\neach sequence in our dataset. Each jittered sequence is cre-\nated by adding a small amount of zero mean Gaussian noise,\nbiasing the whole sequence by a single point. In initial ex-\nperiments we modiÔ¨Åed the number of jittered sequences at\nmultiple levels between 0 and 50, but found 10 to offer the\nbest performance.\n6.3 CRF Parameterization\nAs previously discussed, the training of CRFs requires the\nselection of feature functions. In our experiments, we elect\nto use three different types of features: a simple unigram\nnode feature for each acoustic feature dimension, a unigram\nedge feature that models the change in each feature dimen-\nsion between nodes, and a simple bigram (second order) fea-\nture that models the joint probability of the next two states\nfor arbitrary input. The total number of binary CRF features\nfor a selected training set is described in Table 3.\nAdditionally, in the case of the CRF trained on indepen-\ndent observations, we remove all but node features, so as\nto avoid an artiÔ¨Åcial decrease in performance. When pre-\nsenting the training algorithm with independent examples\ninstead of sequences, feature functions that encode time de-\npendencies that cannot be modeled lead to large decreases\nin performance.\nThe training of graphical models such as CRFs tends to\nhave a very high computational cost. We ran our experi-\nments on Amazon‚Äôs Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)6using\nHigh-CPU Extra Large Instances (c1.xlarge) which provide\naccess to a 64-bit platform with 8 virtual cores. Shown in\nTable 3 is the computation time for each feature domain the\nCRF was trained on as well as the number of binary features\ncreated using the speciÔ¨Åed feature functions.\n6http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/Feature # CRF Features Compute Time (hrs)\nContrast 210,782 11 .49¬±1.245\nMFCC 300,927 11 .81¬±1.515\nENT 185,009 12 .04¬±0.461\nTable 3 . Computing time analysis for CRF training on each\ncross-validation set.\n6.4 Evaluating CRF Performance\nWe begin our analysis by attempting to predict a singular\nA-V point at each second in our sequences. These predic-\ntions are taken as the means of the CRF heatmaps, which we\ncompare to the means of the MLR Gaussian distributions. In\nthe second stage of analysis we investigate the accuracy of\nthe CRF heatmaps, which we compare to MLR Gaussian\nheatmaps.\n6.4.1 A-V Mean Prediction\nWe compute the heatmap mean as the sum of the weighted\nA-V coordinate values of each bin center. For each two-\ndimensional heatmap we compute,\n¬µa=/summationdisplay\nya,yvP(ya,yv|x)ya,\n¬µv=/summationdisplay\nya,yvP(ya,yv|x)yv. (1)\nwhereyaandyvare the arousal and valence coordinates of\neach bin center. The mean values for the ground truth distri-\nbution are computed directly in the continuous A-V space.\nThese results are available in the third column of Table 4.\nOverall we see the best performance (minimum mean /lscript2er-\nror) of 0.122using the CRF with MFCCs, which is signif-\nicantly improved over the best result with MLR, which is\nspectral contrast at 0.140.\n6.4.2 Heatmap Prediction Evaluation\nAs previously stated, because the CRF is a fully connected\nmodel, we can use the transition probabilities to construct an\nA-V heatmap. But the ground truth heatmap must be esti-\nmated empirically as a two dimensional histogram, which is\na difÔ¨Åcult task. In traditional generative estimation the goal\nis to Ô¨Åt a probabilistic model to data, and derive a smooth\nfunction, even with a small dataset. But with histograms, a\nsmall amount of data can lead to sparse, blocky estimates,\nand a massive amount of data is needed to achieve the true\nsmooth distribution.\nAs a result of this we have chosen the earth mover‚Äôs dis-\ntance (EMD) [14] to be our primary metric for comparing\nthese histograms, which can be thought of as the minimum\ncost of transforming one heatmap into the other. Using this\nmetric we can take into account the weight of adjacent bins,\nwhich overall provides a more accurate comparison of the\n78012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nAcoustic Prediction A-V Mean Heatmap Earth Heatmap Error Heatmap Error Heatmap Error\nFeature Method /lscript2Error Mover‚Äôs Distance Unsmoothed (√ó10‚àí2)Smoothed G.T.

These results are in the fourth column of Ta-\nble 4, where we Ô¨Ånd the CRF to be the best performer with\nan EMD of 0.173, which is signiÔ¨Åcantly better than the CRF\ntrained on independent samples at 0.186and MLR at 0.213.\nBut we also investigate the absolute pixel error between\nthe predicted and ground truth heatmaps. These results are\nshown in the Ô¨Åfth column of Table 4, and we Ô¨Ånd that MLR\nappears to be performing slightly better than the CRF. This\nresult is not surprising given the sparsity that our ground\ntruth heatmaps exhibit, which is to be expected with 121\nhistogram bins computed from an average of 16.93rat-\nings. The MLR method which predicts Gaussian distribu-\ntions guarantees a smooth distribution, which will produce a\nlower pixel error if the ground truth is sparse or blocky than\nthe CRF which takes arbitrary shapes. But it can be easily\ndemonstrated that the CRF is more accurate by applying a\nsimple smoothing function to the ground truth.\nTo smooth out the blocking artifacts from sparsity we ap-\nply a simple 2-d Gaussian Ô¨Ålter. This process applies a light\nsmoothing without altering the mean of the data. These re-\nsults are shown in the sixth column of Table 4. Here the\nCRF performs slightly better, and the performance similar-\nity is most likely because the CRF is producing rough edges\ncompared to the smooth MLR predictions that are computed\nfrom the Gaussian PDF. An interesting result is that the in-\ndependently learned CRFs perform the best here. This is\nmost likely because they produce more uniform transition\nprobabilities due to their training method.\nTo compensate for blocking artifacts in the CRF predic-\ntions, we apply a smoothing Ô¨Ålter to them as well. Initial\nexperiments showed applying the same Ô¨Ålter to the MLR\nheatmaps improved performance there too, so to keep our\nanalysis consistent we apply the Ô¨Ålter them as well. We\nexamine the differences in heatmaps using mean absolute\nerror, and these results are shown in the seventh column of\nTable 4. In these results we see again that the CRF is per-\nforming signiÔ¨Åcantly better than MLR.6.4.3 Visualizing the Results\nShown in Figure 2 are the CRF heatmap predictions for\neight seconds of the song ‚ÄúSomething About You,‚Äù by\nBoston. The colormap of these heatmaps assigns red to ar-\neas of high density, blue to low, and uses the color spec-\ntrum to assign colors in between. This clip was selected be-\ncause of the large change in emotion that occurs at second\n29, where the song transitions from a low-energy, negative-\nemotion introduction into a high-energy, positive-emotion\nhard-rock verse. The system tracks the transition very accu-\nrately, showing a brief amount of uncertainty at second 30\nin terms of positive or negative emotion, and Ô¨Ånally settles\non positive emotion at second 31. Prediction videos using\nthe system are also available online.7\n7. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe have demonstrated conditional random Ô¨Åelds to be a\npowerful tool for modeling time-varying musical emotion.\nThe CRF approach is shown to be superior to MLR both\nat predicting single A-V mean values as well as full emo-\ntion space heatmaps. Overall, the best performing feature\nfor CRF prediction is MFCCs, which differs from our MLR\nmethod, where spectral contrast performs best. This perhaps\nindicates that there is more information to be gained out of\nMFCCs when modeling the temporal evolution of emotion.\nUsing the earth mover‚Äôs distance we are able to better\nanalyze the similarity between heatmaps by also taking into\naccount adjacent bin densities. While the MLR method ap-\npears to perform slightly higher when the ground truth dis-\ntributions are not smoothed, this is a result of blocking ar-\ntifacts in the ground truth. The the Gaussian density is a\nsmooth function, which is much more likely to be similar\nto a sparse ground truth distribution than the CRF predic-\ntions, which take on arbitrary shapes and are not necessarily\n7http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/emotion\n781Oral Session 9: Emotion and Mood\nEmotion Space Heatmap PredictionBoston: Something About You, 25-32 secs Figure 2 .

Overall, the ground truth representation could\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly beneÔ¨Åt from more data.\nIn a future approach, the CRF performance could be im-\nproved by developing a model which can encapsulate the\nA-V spatial relationships between CRF nodes, which could\npotentially produce smoother estimates without any need for\nlabel jittering. In such a model, we could also limit the con-\nnections between local heatmap pixels, thus allowing us the\nability to tradeoff model complexity for the Ô¨Çexibility of our\nemotion space distribution Ô¨Çexibility.\n8.

This reinterpretation aims to correct inconsistencies in the original distance space, like the hub phenomenon. Hubs are objects which appear unwontedly often as nearest neighbors in predominantly high-dimensional spaces. We apply Mutual Proximity to a widely used and standard content-based audio similarity algorithm. The algorithm is known to be negatively affected by the high number of hubs it produces. We show that without a modification of the audio similarity features or inclusion of additional knowledge about the datasets, applying Mutual Proximity leads to a significant increase of retrieval quality: (1) hubs decrease and (2) the k-nearest-neighbor classification rates increase significantly. The results of this paper show that taking the mutual neighborhood of objects into account is an important aspect which should be considered for this class of content-based audio similarity algorithms.",

Hubs are\nobjects which appear unwontedly often as nearest neighbors\nin predominantly high-dimensional spaces.\nWe apply Mutual Proximity to a widely used and stan-\ndard content-based audio similarity algorithm. The algo-\nrithm is known to be negatively affected by the high number\nof hubs it produces. We show that without a modiÔ¨Åcation\nof the audio similarity features or inclusion of additional\nknowledge about the datasets, applying Mutual Proximity\nleads to a signiÔ¨Åcant increase of retrieval quality: (1) hubs\ndecrease and (2) the k-nearest-neighbor classiÔ¨Åcation rates\nincrease signiÔ¨Åcantly.\nThe results of this paper show that taking the mutual\nneighborhood of objects into account is an important aspect\nwhich should be considered for this class of content-based\naudio similarity algorithms.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nA number of audio similarity algorithms which have been\npublished so far are affected by the so called ‚Äúhub prob-\nlem‚Äù [1, 4, 6, 16]. Hubs are over-popular nearest neighbors,\ni.e. the same objects are repeatedly identiÔ¨Åed as nearest\nneighbors. The effect is particularly problematic in algo-\nrithms for similarity search, as the same ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù objects\nare found over and over again. In 2010 Radovanovi ¬¥c et\nal. [19] published an in-depth work about hubs, showing\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.that they are yet another facet of the curse of dimension-\nality. Radovanovi ¬¥c also showed that ‚Äúbad hubs‚Äù (objects\nwhich are a bad retrieval result, in addition to being a hub)\ncan degrade the retrieval quality of algorithms signiÔ¨Åcantly.\nThe work of this paper was inspired by these problems\nand presents a straightforward method to reduce the ‚Äúhub\nproblem‚Äù signiÔ¨Åcantly. In the case of the standard audio\nsimilarity algorithm we use in this work we can show how to\nreduce its number of hubs while simultaneously increasing\nits retrieval quality.\n2. RELATED WORK\nNearest neighbor search (NNS) is a well deÔ¨Åned task: given\nan objectxÔ¨Ånd the most similar object in a collection of\nrelated objects. In the simplest case the problem is solved\nby a linear search, computing a distance/similarity between\nxand all other objects, sorting the distances/similarities to\nreturn the top k-nearest neighbors.\nA natural aspect of nearest neighbor relations is that they\ndo not need to be symmetric: that is, object yis the nearest\nneighbor ofx, but the nearest neighbor of yis another object\na(a/negationslash=x). This behavior is problematic if xandybelong\nto the same class but adoes not, thus it is said aviolates the\npairwise cluster stability [3]. Although ais, in terms of the\ndistance measure, the correct answer to the nearest neighbor\nquery fory, it may be beneÔ¨Åcial to use a distance measure\nenforcing symmetric nearest neighbors. Thus a small dis-\ntance between two objects would be returned only if their\nnearest neighbors concur. Figure 1 illustrates this effect.\nRepairing sometimes contradicting, asymmetric nearest\nneighbor information in a similarity measure was already in-\nvestigated in a number of works. The Ô¨Årst publication which\nexploits common near neighbor information dates back as\nfar as 1973. Jarvis and Patrick [11] propose a ‚ÄúShared Near\nNeighbor‚Äù similarity measure to improve the clustering of\nnon-globular clusters. As the name may suggest the Shared\nNear Neighbor ( SNN ) similarity is based on computing the\n79Poster Session 1\n(a)(a) Original nearest neigh-\nbor relations\n(b)(b) Desired nearest neigh-\nbor relations\nFigure 1 : Schematic plot of two classes (black/white Ô¨Ålled\ncircles).

(1)\nShared Near Neighbor similarity was also used by Ert ¬®oz\net al. [5] to Ô¨Ånd the most representative items in a set of\nobjects. Jin et al. [12] use the Reverse Nearest Neighbor\n(RNN) relation to deÔ¨Åne a general measure for outlier de-\ntection.\nOther work which takes advantage of the asymmetry of\nnearest neighbors to correct the distance space was per-\nformed by Pohle et al., who propose a method named Prox-\nimity VeriÔ¨Åcation (PV) [17]. Two objects are considered\nsimilar if both objects have a low nearest neighbor rank\naccording to their counterpart. An unsupervised technique\nusing the local neighborhood of objects to improve the re-\ntrieval accuracy of cover song detection systems is proposed\nby Lagrange and Serr `a [13].\nAn effect of high dimensionality which affects particu-\nlarly NNS is the hub problem. Berenzweig [4] suspected a\nconnection between the hub problem and the high dimen-\nsionality of the feature space. Radovanovi ¬¥c et al. [19] were\nable to provide more insight by linking the hub problem to\nthe property of distance concentration in high dimensions.\nConcentration is the surprising characteristic of all points in\na high dimensional space to be at almost the same distance\nto all other points in that space. It is usually measured as a\nratio between spread and magnitude, e.g. the ratio between\nthe standard deviation of all distances to an arbitrary refer-\nence point and the mean of these distances. If the standard\ndeviation stays more or less constant with growing dimen-\nsionality while the mean keeps growing, the ratio converges\nto zero with dimensionality going to inÔ¨Ånity. In such a caseit is said that the distances concentrate. This has been stud-\nied for Euclidean spaces and other /lscriptp-norms. Radovanovi ¬¥c\npresented the argument that in the Ô¨Ånite case, some points\nare expected to be closer to the center than other points and\nare at the same time closer, on average, to all other points.\nSuch points closer to the center have a high probability of\nbeing hubs, i.e. of appearing in nearest neighbor lists of\nmany other points.\nHubs were observed in music information retrieval [2],\nimage [9] and text retrieval [19] making this phenomenon a\ngeneral problem for information retrieval and recommenda-\ntion algorithms.\nA music similarity algorithm which is adversely affected\nby the ‚Äúhub problem‚Äù is the method published by Mandel\nand Ellis [15]. The algorithm is widely seen as a standard\nmethod for computing music similarity and its hub prob-\nlems have already been noticed and investigated (for exam-\nple by Flexer et al. [6]). The algorithm uses a timbre model\ncomputed from the audio signal for music similarity. In its\ncore the basic method stores the music similarity informa-\ntion for each music piece in a single multivariate Gaussian,\nwhich is estimated from the Mel Cepstrum Frequency Co-\nefÔ¨Åcients [14] (MFCCs) of the audio signal. To compute the\nsimilarity usually closed form solutions of Kullback-Leibler\nrelated divergences are used.\n3. AUDIO SIMILARITY\nThis work uses the basic algorithm from Mandel and El-\nlis [15] to compute audio similarity. To compute the features\nwe use 25MFCCs for each 46msof audio with a 23mshop\nsize. This corresponds to a window size of 1024 and a hop\nsize of 512audio samples at a sampling rate of 22.05kHz .\nA Gaussian model is estimated from the MFCC represen-\ntation of each song so that Ô¨Ånally a single timbre model is\ndescribed by a 25-dimensional mean vector, and a 25√ó25-\ndimensional covariance matrix. We use the Matlab music\nanalysis (MA) toolbox1to compute the features.\nTo compute the similarity between two timbre models\nwe use a Jensen-Shannon approximation (js), a stable sym-\nmetrized version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence from\nthe multivariate normal (MVN) toolbox2.\n4. THE METHOD\nIn this section we introduce a method that is based on: (i)\ntransforming distances between points xandyinto proba-\nbilities thatyis closest neighbor to xgiven the distribution\nof all distances to xin the data base, (ii) combining these\nprobabilistic distances from xtoyandytoxvia the prod-\nuct rule. The result is a general unsupervised method to\n1http://www.pampalk.at/ma/\n2http://www.ofai.at/~dominik.schnitzer/mvn\n8012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ntransform arbitrary distance matrices to matrices of proba-\nbilistic mutual proximity (MP). The Ô¨Årst step of transforma-\ntion to probabilities re-scales and normalizes the distances\nlike a z-transform. The second step combines the proba-\nbilities to a mutual measure akin to shared near neighbor\napproaches. By supporting symmetric nearest neighbors the\nmethod leads to a natural decrease of asymmetric neighbor-\nhood relations and as a result, to a decrease of hubs.\n4.1 Preliminaries\nGiven a non-empty set Mwithnobjects, each object mx‚àà\nMassigned an index x= 1..n. We deÔ¨Åne MP to be used for\na divergence measure d:M√óM‚ÜíRwith the following\nproperties:\n‚Ä¢ non-negativity: d(mx,my)‚â•0,\n‚Ä¢ identity:d(mx,my) = 0,‚áê‚áímx=my,\n‚Ä¢ symmetry: d(mx,my) =d(my,mx).\nIndividual elements mx‚ààMare referenced in the text by\ntheir indexx. The distance between two elements refer-\nenced by their index is denoted as dx,y.\n4.2 Mutual Proximity (MP)\nIn a Ô¨Årst step for each element xthe average distance ÀÜ¬µx\nand the standard deviation ÀÜœÉxof all its distances dx,i=1..n\ninMis computed, estimating a Gaussian distance distri-\nbutionX/revsimilarN(ÀÜ¬µx,ÀÜœÉx)for each element x(Equation 2).\nThis is based on the assumption that our data is normally\ndistributed due to the central limit theorem. The estimated\nnormalXthus models the spread of distances from xto all\nother elements in M:\nÀÜ¬µx=1\nnn/summationdisplay\ni=1dx,i, ÀÜœÉ2\nx=1\nnn/summationdisplay\ni=1(dx,i‚àíÀÜ¬µx)2.\nFigure 2a shows a schematic plot of the probability den-\nsity (pdf) function which was estimated for the distances of\nx. The mean distance ( ÀÜ¬µx) is in the center of the density\nfunction. Objects with a small distance to x(i.e. objects\nwith high similarity in the original space) Ô¨Ånd their distance\non the left-side of the density function. Note that the left-\nmost distance in the Gaussian is dx,x= 0.\nBy estimating a normal distribution Xfrom the distances\ndx,i=1..n, it is possible to reinterpret the distance dx,yas the\nprobability that yis the nearest neighbor of x, given the dis-\ntancedx,yand normalX(that is the probability that a ran-\ndomly drawn element zwill have a distance dx,z>dx,y):\nP(X >d x,y) = 1‚àíP(X/lessdblequaldx,y)\n= 1‚àíFx(dx,y).Fxdenotes the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of\nthe normal distribution deÔ¨Åned by X. The probability of an\nelement being a nearest neighbor of xincreases the more\nleft its distance is on the x-axis of the pdf (cf. Figure 2a). To\nillustrate that Figure 2b plots the probability of ybeing the\nnearest neighbor of xgivendx,y(the Ô¨Ålled area).\nTransforming all original distances into the probability\nthat a pointyis a nearest neighbor of xoffers a convenient\nway to combine this with the opposite view (the probability\nxis the nearest neighbor of y) into a single expression.\nDeÔ¨Ånition 1 Under the assumption of independence, we\ncompute the probability that yis the nearest neighbor of x\ngivenX(the Normal deÔ¨Åned by the distances dx,i=1..n) and\nxis the nearest neighbor of ygivenY(the Normal deÔ¨Åned\nby the distances dy,i=1..n). We call the resulting probability\nMutual Proximity (MP) :\nMP(dx,y) =P(X >d x,y‚à©Y >d x,y)\n=P(X >d x,y)¬∑P(Y >d x,y),‚àÄdx,y>0\n(2)\nClearly the assumption of independence of P(X)and\nP(Y)will be violated, still MP has, as we will show empiri-\ncally, largely positive effects especially in high dimensional\ndata spaces with high hubness.\n4.3 Properties\nMP is symmetric MP(dx,y) =MP(dy,x)and its values\nare normalized to the interval [0‚àí1]. Note that the method\ncan therefore be easily used to linearly combine multiple\ndifferent distance measures.\nMP will only be high if both nearness probabilities are\nhigh and thus if their distance indicates a close mutual rela-\ntionship in terms of their distance distributions. If this is not\nthe case, i.e., one of the probabilities is small, their MP will\nbe small too.\n4.4 Matlab\nThe following Octave3/Matlab4code snippet demonstrates\nthe simplicity of the method. It computes DMPfor a given\nn√óndistance matrix D:\nm = mean(D);\ns = std(D);\nfor i = 1:n\nfor j = (i+1):n\nD_MP(i, j) =\n(1 - normcdf(D(i, j), m(i), s(i))) *\n(1 - normcdf(D(i, j), m(j), s(j)));\nend\nend\n3http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\n4http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/\n81Poster Session 1\nX ~ N( ¬µx, œÉx)\n¬µx¬µx ‚àí œÉx¬µx + œÉxdx,xf(dx,i)\ndx,i=1..n(a) The closer other elements are to x, the more left their distance is located\non x-axis of the density function plot.

EV ALUATION\nTo evaluate the effects of using MP for the selected au-\ndio similarity algorithm we use eight different music col-\nlections (see Table 1 for collection characteristics like col-\nlection size or numbers of genres). The collection sizes\nrange from 100 to 16 000 music pieces. Four collections\n(homburg [10], ismir2004-train5andismir2004-dev ,ball-\nroom [7]) are public benchmark sets. The other collections\n(DB-S, DB-XL, DB-RBA, DB-L) are private benchmark\ncollections. Each individual song in the collections is as-\nsigned to a music genre.\n5.1 Metrics\nThe following metrics are used to evaluate the Mutual Prox-\nimity transformation with the music similarities:\n5.1.1 Leave-One-Out, k-Nearest Neighbor Genre\nClassiÔ¨Åcation ( Ck)\nWe compute the k-nearest neighbor classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy\nusing a leave-one-out genre classiÔ¨Åcation. The k-NN classi-\nÔ¨Åcation accuracy is denoted with Ck. Higher values indicate\nmore consistent retrieval quality in terms of the class/genre.\nIt is one of the standard methods to measure the retrieval\nquality of audio similarity algorithms.\n5.1.2 Goodman-Kruskal Index ( IGK)\nTo evaluate the impact of the MP transformation, we also\ncompute the Goodman-Kruskal Index [8]. IGKis a ratio\ncomputed from the number of concordant (Qc) and discon-\ncordant (Qd) distance tuples. A distance tuple is concordant\nifdi,j<dk,land objectsi,jare from the same classes and\nk,lfrom different classes. It is is discordant if di,j>dk,l.\n5http://ismir2004.ismir.net/genre contest/index.htmIGKis bound to the interval [‚àí1; 1]. The higher it is, the\nmore concordant distance tuples were found, thus indicating\ntighter and better clustering.\n5.1.3 Hubness ( Sk)\nWe also compute the hubness [19] for each collection. Hub-\nness is deÔ¨Åned as the average skewness of the distribution of\nk-occurrences ( Nk):\nSk=E/bracketleftbig\n(Nk‚àí¬µNk)3/bracketrightbig\nœÉ3\nNk\nPositive skewness indicates high hubness (high number\nof hub objects), skewness values around zero a more even\ndistribution of nearest neighbors.\n5.2 Results\nTable 1 displays the full evaluation results of the selected au-\ndio similarity algorithm according to the metrics introduced\nin the previous section. In the table each collection spans\ntwo rows, the Ô¨Årst row showing the evaluation metrics com-\nputed for the original data space and the second row listing\nthe values when using MP.\nThe collections listed in the table are sorted by their hub-\nness value in the original distance space. From the high\nhubness values ( 1.93‚àí9.29) the hub problem of the audio\nsimilarity algorithm can be clearly seen. For example, a sin-\ngle hub song in DB-L is occurring in over 10% of all k= 5\nnearest neighbor lists in the collection. On the contrary hub-\nness is sharply decreasing when looking at the values MP\nproduces, which may indicate that MP creates a more evenly\nspread object space. The average hubness values per collec-\ntion decrease from 4.6 to 1.2; Figure 4 shows the individual\nhubness values in a plot. Another metric which increases\nfor all collections is the Goodman-Kruskal index( IGK), in-\ndicating a better separation of genres in the distance space\nafter using MP.\n8212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nName, # Collection Genres nDistance Ck=1+/-Ck=5+/-Sk=5IGK\nDB-S 16 100 js 57.0%5.042.0%7.21.93 0.59\n1 MP 62.0% 49.2% 0.65 0.74\nballroom 8 698 js 54.7%4.946.3%4.82.63 0.16\n2 MP 59.6% 51.1% 1.05 0.20\nismir 2004 (tr) 6 729 js 82.9%3.473.6%3.23.61 0.35\n3 MP 86.3% 76.8% 1.15 0.41\nismir 2004 (tr+dev) 6 1458 js 86.5%3.880.6%3.34.22 0.37\n4 MP 90.3% 83.9% 1.31 0.42\nhomburg 9 1886 js 46.7%3.743.6%3.14.26 0.30\n5 MP 50.4% 46.7% 1.33 0.34\nDB-XL 21 16778 js 55.9%5.146.6%5.54.69 0.12\n6 MP 61.0% 52.1% 1.37 0.19\nDB-RBA 36 3423 js 51.4%4.741.6%4.85.77 0.26\n7 MP 56.1% 46.4% 1.69 0.31\nDB-L 22 2526 js 77.2%5.068.1%5.79.29 0.47\n8 MP 82.2% 73.8% 1.16 0.55\nTable 1 : The detailed evaluation results comparing the use of MP with a standard variant.

When comparing the two values computed for\nthe original audio similarity measure and MP, we see that\nin all collections the retrieval quality in terms of genre clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation rates increases noticeable when MP is used. For\nk= 1 classiÔ¨Åcation increases on average by 4.5%-points,\nfork= 5on average by 4.7%-points. Figure 3 and Table 1\n(columns +/-) show the increase in 1/5-NN genre classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion rates per collection.\n5.3 Summary\nTo summarize the evaluation we can see that all metrics we\ncomputed to evaluate the impact of MP lead to signiÔ¨Åcant\nimprovements in the retrieval quality of the basic audio sim-\nilarity measure proposed by Mandel and Ellis [15] in 2005.\n83Poster Session 1\nIn the case of the homburg andismir 2004 music genre\ncollections its performance is now very close to the reported\nperformance of the audio similarity algorithm by Pohle et\nal. [18] which ranked top in the 2009/10 MIREX (task: au-\ndio similarity and retrieval ) evaluations. Their quite sophis-\nticated algorithm uses MFCCs, Spectral Contrast features,\n‚ÄúHarmonicness‚Äù, ‚ÄúAttackness‚Äù and a Rhythm component\n(Table 2).\nCollection Pohle [18] Mandel [15] Mandel+MP\nhomburg 50.9% 46.7% 50.4%\nismir 2004 (tr) 87.6% 82.9% 86.3%\nismir 2004 (tr+dev) 90.4% 86.5% 90.3%\nTable 2 : Nearest-neighbor ( k= 1) leave-one-out- genre\nclassiÔ¨Åcation accuracy comparison using MP.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThe authors Ô¨Ånd it very exciting to see the potential for im-\nprovements that one of the most basic content-based audio\nsimilarity algorithms still offers without any modiÔ¨Åcation\nof its MFCC similarity features. Without using any class\ninformation and only by using a simple unsupervised trans-\nformation rewarding common neighbors, the long standing\nproblem of hub songs is alleviated and genre classiÔ¨Åcation\nrates for the algorithm can be increased signiÔ¨Åcantly.\nAs Mutual Proximity can be used with arbitrary distance\nmeasures it is also interesting to study the effects of MP on\ndatasets from different research areas. Preliminary tests in\nthat direction show that MP has in fact similar beneÔ¨Åcial\neffects on any high dimensional dataset suffering from high\nhubness in its original distance space.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research is supported by the Austrian Research Fund\n(FWF) (grants P22856-N23, L511-N15, Z159) and the Vi-\nenna Science and Technology Fund WWTF (Audiominer,\nproject number MA09-024).

In this paper we show\nthat by simple re-ordering of the query Ô¨Ångerprint‚Äôs sub-\nprints in the index-based retrieval step, the overall search\nperformance can be increased signiÔ¨Åcantly. Furthermore,\nwe show that combining longer Ô¨Ångerprints with re-ordering\ncan lead to even higher performance gains, up to a factor of\n9.8. The proposed re-ordering scheme is based on the ob-\nservation that sub-prints, which are elements of n-runs of\nidentical consecutive sub-prints, have a higher survival rate\nin distorted copies of a signal (e.g. after mp3 compression)\nthan other sub-prints.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIn 2002 Jaap Haitsma and Ton Kalker proposed their au-\ndio Ô¨Ångerprinting system [4], which today is still in use at\nGracenote [3], competing with other commercial systems\nlike Shazam [7, 8]. In this system, identity of two songs is\nestablished by comparing so called Ô¨Ångerprints. These Ô¨Ån-\ngerprints correspond to ca. 3seconds of audio and are com-\nprised of 256 sub-prints, each representing 11.6millisec-\nonds of audio with 32-bits. For a general overview of audio\nÔ¨Ångerprinting systems, we refer to [1].\nTo identify an unknown audio fragment (the query), Ô¨Ån-\ngerprints are extracted from the query and compared with\nÔ¨Ångerprints stored in a database. Typically, as the fragment\nis exposed to distortions such as additive noise or compres-\nsion artifacts, one cannot assume to Ô¨Ånd an identical Ô¨Ånger-\nprint in the database. Therefore, the similarity of two Ô¨Ån-\ngerprints is expressed in terms of the bit error rate (BER).\nThe lower the BER, the more likely two Ô¨Ångerprints belong\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.to the same song. If the BER is below a certain threshold\n(œÑ= 0.35), both Ô¨Ångerprints are assumed to stem from the\nsame song.\nComparing all query Ô¨Ångerprints for a song with all\nreference Ô¨Ångerprints is only feasible for databases con-\ntaining a very limited number of recordings. There-\nfore, Haitsma/Kalker proposed an efÔ¨Åcient two-step hashing\nscheme. In the Ô¨Årst step, indexing techniques are employed\nto detect ‚Äúanchor points‚Äù in the database. The idea is, that\neven though there typically is not an exact match for a whole\nquery Ô¨Ångerprint in the database, at least one of the 256sub-\nprints occurs unaltered (without any bit error) in query and\nreference Ô¨Ångerprints. Exploiting this idea, Haitsma/Kalker\npropose to use one 32-bit long sub-print of the query Ô¨Ånger-\nprint at a time and query the reference database for identical\nsub-prints. The positions of exact matches of sub-prints in\nthe database then serve as said anchor points. In the second\nstep, the BER for entire Ô¨Ångerprints (consisting of 256sub-\nprints) around these anchor points is calculated. If it turns\nout to be lower than the threshold, the search is terminated\nand the identiÔ¨Åed song returned.\nAs the number of reference Ô¨Ångerprint lookups and BER\ncomputations is considerably reduced by this strategy, this\nway of searching is multiple orders of magnitude faster than\nthe na ¬®ƒ±ve approach of comparing Ô¨Ångerprints with all refer-\nence Ô¨Ångerprints in the database. The lookup of potentially\nmatching songs using unaltered sub-prints is a crucial step in\nthis approach. To Ô¨Ånd them, the system maintains a lookup\ntable with entries for each of the possible 32-bit sub-prints.\nEach entry points to a linked list of songs the given sub-\nprint occurs in and the position of the sub-print within this\nsong (Figure 1). Obviously the system is faster, if it Ô¨Ånds a\nmatching Ô¨Ångerprint in as few sub-print lookups as possible.\nIn this paper, we propose an extension to the original al-\ngorithm. Our main idea is to re-order the lookup of unal-\ntered sub-prints in such a way that those sub-prints more\nlikely to survive compression distortions are looked up Ô¨Årst.\nIn our experiments, we show that this is the case for sub-\nprints, which are elements of n-runs of identical consecu-\ntive sub-prints (Figure 2). Exploiting this property in a sim-\n127Poster Session 1\n!\"#$%&'()*+!\"#%($%*,#+-+!\"!!!!!!!#+!\"!!!!!!!!+-++.)%+\n/0123454016+\n789:;4016<+!\"!!!!!!!!+!\"!!!!!!!#+-++++++!\"////////+=>>?85+@A9B3+\n7>12+*+!\"#.*,C///+-+++!\"!!!!!!!!+-+++!\"**D)&#.%+7>12+,+\n!\"*,C&D$#)+-+!\"!!!!!!!#+-+++!\"!!!!!!!!+-+!\"//D)&$#%+\nE.)F+\nFigure 1 .

In a second step, we apply the re-ordering\nscheme to Ô¨Ångerprints longer than 256sub-prints achieving\neven higher improvements up to a factor of 9.8.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In\nSection 2 we motivate our re-ordering scheme by investi-\ngating the distribution of sub-prints and their likelihood of\nsurviving compression distortions. Then, in Section 3, as\nour main contribution, we introduce in detail the re-ordering\nscheme. In Section 4 we give experimental evidence for the\nspeed-up of our approach in a real-world runtime analysis.\nFinally, conclusions and outlook on future work are given in\nSection 5.\n2. SUB-PRINT PROPERTIES\nIn this section, we explain in detail the computation of the\nÔ¨Ångerprints as proposed in [4] (Section 2.1). Then, in Sec-\ntion 2.2, we show that these Ô¨Ångerprints are strongly cor-\nrelated over time by analyzing audio recordings of three\ndatasets of different genres. Finally, in Section 2.3, we show\nthat the temporal correlation can be exploited for identifying\nmore robust sub-prints.\n2.1 Computation\nFollowing [4], we compute the sub-prints from a given au-\ndio signal in three steps. In the Ô¨Årst step, a spectrogram\nis derived from the audio.

The distributions for the\nWA V encoded reference Ô¨Åles are almost identical.\nresponding to 0.37 sec of the audio. These frames overlap\nby a factor of 31/32yielding one frame for every 11.6 ms .\nIn the second step, by suitably pooling spectral coefÔ¨Åcients,\nthe frequency axis of the spectrogram is adapted to the hu-\nman auditory system. More precisely, energy values are\ncomputed for 33non-overlapping spectral bands. These\nbands are logarithmically spaced and cover the frequency\nrange from 300 Hz to2000 Hz . Finally, in the third step,\nÔ¨Ångerprints are derived.

Each of the sub-prints\nrepresents 11.6 ms of the audio with 32-bit, see Figure 2 for\na schematic illustration of a Ô¨Ångerprint.\n2.2 Temporal Correlation\nAs pointed out in [4], because of the high amount of overlap\nbetween adjacent frames, the sub-prints are temporally cor-\nrelated. In fact, they are correlated so strongly that often one\n12812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 4 . Probability of an iTunes mp3 encoded sub-print\nat a given position min ann-run having an identical coun-\nterpart in a reference Ô¨Ångerprint depending on the length of\nthen-run it belongs to.\nsub-print is followed by one or more identical sub-prints.\nWe call such a sequence of identical consecutive sub-prints\nann-run (see Figure 2). For the remainder of this paper, n-\nruns withn= 1will also be called singles andn-runs with\nn>1are referred to as higher runs.\nTo better understand the temporal correlation of sub-\nprints, we analyzed a large collection of audio recordings\nof various genres with respect to the occurrence of n-\nruns. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we used the sub-collections RWC-Jazz,\nRWC-Pop, and RWC-Classical provided by the RWC Music\nDatabase [2]. Overall, there are 211recordings with a total\nduration of 16 hours . We consider each of these recordings\nin three different versions of different quality. Firstly, we re-\nfer to the CD quality versions denoted as reference versions.\nFurthermore, we consider two encoded ( distorted ) versions\nderived from the reference employing lossy audio codecs.\nAs a mildly compressed version, we use an mp3 version\nencoded with 128 kbps using iTunes. This version can be\nregarded to be of ‚Äústandard‚Äù quality. Finally, as a heavily\ncompressed version of poor audio quality, we encode the\nreference versions using the (full rate) 13kbps GSM V oice\ncodec. Originally intended for the compression of speech\nsignals, this codec introduces severe audible distortions to\nmusic signals. This version is included in our analysis as an\nextreme case.\nFigure 3 shows the percentage of sub-prints that occur in\nann-run of identical sub-prints for versions encoded with\niTunes mp3 128kbps or GSM. As our results show, the sub-\nprints are temporally correlated. For all three datasets and\nboth encodings about 30% of all sub-prints occur in higher\nruns. For example, in the case of RWC-Jazz (mp3), 23% are\nFigure 5 . Probability of a GSM encoded sub-print at a given\nposition in an n-run having an identical counterpart in a ref-\nerence Ô¨Ångerprint depending on the length of the n-run it\nbelongs to.\na member of a 2-run, 9%of a3-run, 4%of a4-run, and 3%\nof a5-run or even longer run.\n2.3 Robustness\nWe hypothesize that such sub-prints occurring in n-runs are\nmore likely to have unaltered counterparts in distorted ver-\nsions of the same song than sub-prints occurring on their\nown, i.e. as singles. In other words, as the survival rate of\nsub-prints in higher runs is higher, they are more robust.\nTo test this hypothesis we measure the probability of a\nsub-print extracted from a distorted version being identical\nto its reference counterpart. This is done by computing sub-\nprints of the Ô¨Årst 3 min for both reference and distorted ver-\nsions. Because some distortions introduce a minor, linear\nframe-shift (¬±1), we then align both sub-print lists so that\nas many as possible sub-prints are directly opposite an iden-\ntical counterpart. This we call optimal alignment. Subse-\nquently, we categorize the distorted sub-prints as members\nofn-runs along with their position m‚àà[1 :n]in the run\nand record how many sub-prints of each category have un-\naltered, aligned counterparts in the reference sub-print list.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the probabilities of sub-prints that\nare members of an n-run (column group) at position m(col-\numn) having an unaltered counterpart in the reference Ô¨Ån-\ngerprint, i.e. their survival probabilities. Our results for\niTunes encoded mp3 audio (Figure 4) clearly show that sub-\nprints belonging to higher runs are more likely to have an\nunaltered counterpart in the reference Ô¨Ångerprint than sub-\nprints occurring as singles. Taking the RWC-Pop values\nas example, a single sub-print has a relatively low survival\n129Poster Session 1\nprobability of 23%, while a member of a 6-run has a sur-\nvival probability between 45% and65%. Note that, because\nof the low value for singles, the relative survival rate gain\nfrom singles to higher runs is larger for the pop songs than\nfor jazz or classical music. For example, the maximal pos-\nsible gain factor from single to 6-run for RWC-Pop is √ó2.8,\nwhile the gain factor for the RWC-Classical from the single\nwith52% to the maximal 6-run with 95% is only√ó1.8.\nFor GSM encoded Ô¨Åles the effect becomes even more sig-\nniÔ¨Åcant (Figure 5). Here, the survival probabilities are much\nlower, e.g., 0.7%for singles in the case of RWC-Classical.\nFor5-runs this probability increases to values between 5.1%\nand8.0%, a gain factor of√ó11.4.\nAs a second important result, we observe, that in most\ncases those members of n-runs, that take a central position\nin their run, are even more likely to have an identical ref-\nerence counterpart than n-run elements at edge positions.\nFor example, in the case of RWC-Pop (mp3), see Figure 4,\nsub-prints at edge positions of a 6-run have a survival prob-\nability of 45%. For sub-prints at center position, however,\nthis probability is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher at 65%. In the case of\nRWC-Classical (GSM), see Figure 5, sub-prints at edge po-\nsitions of a 5-runs survive with 5.7%probability, sub-prints\nat the center position, however, with 8.0%. We deÔ¨Åne this\ncentral position in an n-run asmcentral =‚åän/2‚åã+ 1. In\nFigures 4 and 5 it is shown in black.\n3. IMPROVING THE SEARCH ALGORITHM\nIn this section, we Ô¨Årst explain the original Haitsma/Kalker\nlookup algorithm. Then we describe our proposed improve-\nments, which are based on the increased robustness of sub-\nprints contained in higher runs. Finally, we present an ex-\nperiment that measures actually achieved overall speedups\nvalidating our chosen approach.\n3.1 Original Algorithm\nSuppose we are given a database containing a large number\nof audio documents, which are converted into binary repre-\nsentations as described in Section 2.1. Then, given a query\nÔ¨ÅngerprintFQ‚àà{0,1}K√ó32, the identiÔ¨Åcation task con-\nsists of Ô¨Ånding a document with binary representation X\nas well as a position tsuch that the Ô¨Ångerprint deÔ¨Åned by\nFD:= (X[t],...,X [t+K‚àí1])is similar to FQ. More\nprecisely, as in [4], we require that the bit error rate (BER)\nbetweenFQandFDis below a threshold œÑ= 0.35. We then\nalso say that FDis amatch forFQ.\nTo avoid an exhaustive Ô¨Ångerprint search in the database,\nan index-based pre-processing step is used to cut down\nthe search space. Here, the binary representations of all\ndatabase documents are indexed by means of the 32-bit sub-\nprints using an index structure that consists of a suitable\nlookup table as illustrated by Figure 1. Then, based on theassumption that at least one sub-print FQ[k],k‚àà[1 :K],\nof the query appears unaltered in the document to be iden-\ntiÔ¨Åed, a lookup is performed to Ô¨Årst retrieve all sub-prints\nthat coincide with FQ[k]. Each of these retrieved candidate\nsub-print consists of a document identiÔ¨Åer and a position\nparametert. LetXbe the binary representation of the cor-\nresponding document, then the BER is computed between\nFQandFD:= (X[t‚àík+ 1],...,X [t‚àík+K]). If the\nBER falls below the threshold œÑ= 0.35, the algorithm ter-\nminates and returns the associated document identiÔ¨Åer. If\nno suchFDcan be found, the algorithm terminates without\nidentifying the query.\nSince a position k, that corresponds to an unaltered sub-\nprint in the database, is not known a-priori, in [4] an outer\nloop is executed querying the index structure for sub-prints\nF[k]in the order in which they appear in FQ, i.e. with in-\ndicesk= 1,2,3,...,K . This loop is aborted as soon as\na matching Ô¨Ångerprint is found. Therefore, the overall run-\nning time of the algorithm crucially depends on the position\nof the index at which an unaltered sup-print of a matching\nÔ¨Ångerprint occurs for the Ô¨Årst time.\n3.2 Sub-Print Re-Ordering\nTo take advantage of the observed sub-print properties, we\nchange the order in which sub-prints are looked up in the\ndatabase. Instead of simply iterating through the sub-prints\nof the query Ô¨Ångerprint from beginning to end, we prioritize\nthose sub-prints that are more likely to lead to matching Ô¨Ån-\ngerprints. This means that we need to look up the central\nsub-prints of higher runs Ô¨Årst, ordered by the length of the\nrun they belong to in descending order. Then we look up the\nsingles and then all remaining sub-prints, again ordered by\nthe length of the run they belong to.\nFigure 6 shows an example for this re-ordering scheme.\nBecause the longest run is the 3-run, we rank its central el-\nement (3) Ô¨Årst. The second longest run is the 2-run, thus its\ncentral element (8) lands on rank 2. Since there are no other\nhigher runs, we then proceed to add all singles in the order\nin which they appear. And eventually, we add the remaining\nsub-prints from the two higher runs (2, 4 and 9).\nThe idea behind this is, that if a central sub-print does not\nlead to a match, it is more likely that another central sub-\nprint leads to a match (even if it is a member of a shorter\nn-run) than a non-central sub-print of an n-run we already\nknow of that its central sub-print does not match.\nMore formally, for a Ô¨Ångerprint FQof lengthK= 256\nwe calculate the rank (k,m,n )withk,m,n‚àà[1 :K]of\neach sub-print FQ[k]that is themthelement of an n-run, and\norder all sub-prints according to their rank in descending\norder. Therank function is deÔ¨Åned as\nrank (k,m,n ) =k+Km+K2n+K3nŒ¥m‚àí1,‚åän/2‚åã(1)\n13012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n!!\"\"!!\"!\"!\"\"!\"\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"#\"#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"\"\"\"\"#$#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"\"\"\"\"#%#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"\"\"\"\"#&#!\"\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!\"\"\"#'#!!\"\"!\"\"\"!!\"!!!\"\"!!\"\"!!!\"!!\"\"\"!\"\"#(#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!!\"!\"\"\"!!\"\"!\"\"!!!\"\"!!\"\"#)#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"\"\"\"\"!!\"\"#*#!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"\"\"\"\"!!\"\"#+#!\"\"\"!!\"\"\"!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"!!\"\"#\"!#%#*#\"#'#(#)#\"!#$#&#+#\n,-./012345#6247#895:45#;:/81<:1:<#895:45#,23=>:#%/1-3#$/1-3#Figure 6 .

Amongst sub-prints\nbelonging to the same run length n, positionmwithin the\nrun andkin the Ô¨Ångerprint become tie-breakers.\nAdditionally to re-ordering, in a second optimization\nstep, we also use a longer query Ô¨Ångerprint. This did not\nmake sense before optimizing the lookup order, as we were\nnot able to recognize more robust sub-prints. But with\nthe suggested re-ordering scheme, enlarging the Ô¨Ångerprint\nincreases our chances of Ô¨Ånding more and longer n-runs,\ntherefore signiÔ¨Åcantly increasing our chances of Ô¨Ånding a\nsurviving sub-print counterpart in the reference data.\nA side effect of this strategy is the necessity of computing\na larger query Ô¨Ångerprint, which puts some additional com-\nputational burden on the client and requires a longer audio\nfragment. For the BER computation we still only use 256\nsub-prints as there is nothing to be gained by using more\nsub-prints.3.3 Experimental VeriÔ¨Åcation\nTo test both approaches, sub-print re-ordering and Ô¨Ånger-\nprint enlargement, we measured the average number of\nsub-print lookups needed to Ô¨Ånd a matching Ô¨Ångerprint in\na database of 200 songs for 100,000 randomly selected\nqueries.\nNote, that in this experiment we focus on sub-print com-\nparisons, not full Ô¨Ångerprint comparisons. Therefore, the\nnumber of songs in the database is irrelevant. Nevertheless,\nsub-print matches lead to Ô¨Ångerprint comparisons. In order\nto measure the total search time, those also need to be taken\ninto account, if the number of song pointers per sub-print\nis not distributed uniformly. For the purpose of this exper-\niment we assume a uniform distribution, in particular one\nthat is independent from the used rank function.\nThe results in Table 1 show that with our optimization\nscheme between 1.5 and 9.8 times fewer lookups are neces-\nsary. Even without enlarging the query Ô¨Ångerprint, we were\nstill able to achieve 2.9times fewer iterations for mp3 Ô¨Åles\nencoded at 128kbps. This equates to only 1.41sub-print\nlookups on average.\nIt also deserves to be mentioned that for audio data with\nstronger distortions (e.g. GSM, mp3 32kbps) our techniques\ntend to yield larger beneÔ¨Åts. One reason for this is that for\nstrongly distorted audio material many more lookups are\nnecessary when no re-ordering is used ( 100.84for GSM as\nopposed to 4.15for mp3 128kbps).\n4. RUNTIME ANALYSIS\nWhy do we care so much about the sub-print lookups? Re-\nalistically, a large scale audio Ô¨Ångerprinting system will\nhave to be able to manage not just 10,000 songs [4], but\nrather 100 million songs‚Äîperhaps even more.1Assum-\ning¬±25,000sub-prints per song, this results in a total of\n25,000¬∑108= 25¬∑1011sub-prints. This means that the\nlookup table proposed by Haitsma/Kalker is not sparsely\npopulated as they claim, but on average each entry con-\ntains a list of pointers to 582 ( = 25¬∑1011/232) songs.\nAssuming that each of these pointers has at least a size of\n4 bytes to reference a song, plus an offset into the song‚Äôs\nreference Ô¨Ångerprint of 2 bytes, we must manage roughly\n232¬∑(4 + 2)¬∑582bytes = 15 terabytes for the pointer lists\nalone. Obviously, with current technology, we cannot sim-\nply load the data-structure into the main memory of a regular\nPC.\nInstead, just like the songs‚Äô sub-prints, the data-structure\nalso has to live in secondary storage (e.g. Ô¨Çat Ô¨Åles, a\nrelational database management system (RDBMS), a no-\nSQL database, or a simple Berkeley DB). In the case of an\n1In May 2011 MusicBrainz [6] stated on its website to have more than\n10 million tracks in its database. This number is probably going to increase\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly as the years go by.\n131Poster Session 1\n!\"#$%&'()*&'(**&+*&'(**)\"#$%&'(*),-..&'(*/0)1(**Figure 7 . Trivial table design for the reference song lookup\nwith an RDBMS.\nRDBMS, a single table containing the columns (song-) id(at\nleast 4 bytes), sub-print (4 bytes) and (sub-print-) offset (at\nleast 2 bytes) is sufÔ¨Åcient (Figure 7). One database index on\nthesub-print column and another on idandoffset ensure fast\naccess.2Assuming the aforementioned setup, the measur-\nable runtime behavior of the algorithm is governed by three\nmain factors:\n1. Number of songs in the database.\n2. Speed of lookup from secondary storage.\n3. Probability of a query sub-print having an identical\nreference counterpart.\nNote that only the number of Ô¨Ångerprint lookups and\nBER computations depend directly and linearly on the num-\nber of songs in the database. This means that the overall\nruntime is linear with respect to the size of the database.\nAs for the secondary storage, even though solid state\ndrives and the decreasing price of RAM slightly blur the\nlines, accessing secondary storage still takes much more\ntime than performing relatively simple arithmetic operations\nlike computing a BER. Therefore we can safely assume that\neach SQL- select operation to look up a Ô¨Ångerprint in the\ndatabase takes orders of magnitude longer than the associ-\nated BER computation. Besides the collection‚Äôs size, sec-\nondary storage access is therefore a determining factor for\nthe absolute runtime of the algorithm.\nFinally, how many times we have to look up complete\nÔ¨Ångerprints and access secondary storage depends highly on\nthe probability that a given query sub-print has an identi-\ncal reference counterpart. As shown above, we can signif-\nicantly increase the probability of Ô¨Ånding an identical sub-\nprint quickly by re-ordering the sub-prints. This is a decid-\ning factor for the runtime of this algorithm and unlike the\nother two mentioned factors it has nothing to do with avail-\nable hardware or the size of the problem.\n2For 100 million songs, this database design leads to the impressive\nstorage requirement of 25terabytes (= (4 + 4 + 2) ¬∑25¬∑1011bytes ),\nplus additional space for the indices. Not surprisingly, Haitsma/Kalker at-\ntempted to reduce this by sub-sampling reference Ô¨Ångerprints [5].5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we presented an optimization scheme of the\nHaitsma/Kalker audio Ô¨Ångerprinting search algorithm. The\nsuggested approach exploits strong temporal correlations\nbetween sub-prints as an indicator for sub-print robustness.\nThis can lead to signiÔ¨Åcant savings in the number of re-\nquired lookups leading to a signiÔ¨Åcant overall speed-up for\nthe identiÔ¨Åcation task.\nFuture research may focus on applying the proposed\nstrategy on other existing algorithms or creating new ones,\nin which only reliable sub-prints are taken into account to\nbegin with, which may lead to shorter, more robust Ô¨Ånger-\nprints and reduced overall storage requirements. Also the\ncombination of our re-ordering strategy with the reliability\nconsiderations proposed by Haitsma/Kalker is subject for\nfuture research.\nAcknowledgement. P. Grosche and M.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic mood analysis, i. e., automatic determination of the\nperceived mood in recorded music, has been an active Ô¨Åeld\nof research in the last decade. For instance, it can en-\nable browsing through music collections for music with a\nspeciÔ¨Åc mood, or to automatically select music best suited\nto a person‚Äôs current mood as determined manually or au-\ntomatically. In this study, we describe music mood by\nRussell‚Äôs circumplex model of affect consisting of a two-\ndimensional space of valence (pleasure‚Äìdispleasure) and\ndegree of arousal which allows to identify emotional tags,\nsuch as the ones used for the MIREX music mood evalua-\ntions [9], as points in the ‚Äòmood space‚Äô, avoiding the am-\nbiguity of categorical taxonomies [21]. Note that in re-\ncent research, e. g. [11], new models have been proposed\nspeciÔ¨Åcally for music emotion, which go beyond the tra-\nditional emotion models by including non-utilitaristic or\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.eclectic emotions. However, the valence / arousal model\nis an emerging standard for describing human emotions in\nautomatic analysis [4]. Thus, from an application point of\nview, it is, e. g., useful for matching human emotions and\nmusic mood, such as for automatic music suggestion [16].\nFor automatic music mood recognition, a great variety of\nfeatures have been proposed, comprising low-level acous-\ntic, such as spectral, cepstral, or chromagram features [18],\nhigher-level audio features such as rhythm [14], as well as\ntextual features derived from the lyrics [12]. Early (feature-\nlevel) and late (classiÔ¨Åer-level) fusion techniques for the\nacoustic and textual modalities have been compared in [8].\nA Ô¨Årst major contribution of this study is to investigate\nregression in the continuous arousal / valence space by sin-\ngle modalities (spectrum, rhythm, lyrics, etc.), and by early\nas well as late fusion. To brieÔ¨Çy relate our work to recent\nperformance studies on music mood regression: In [18] re-\ngression in a purely acoustic feature space has been inves-\ntigated; [10] evaluates automatic feature selection and clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers, but not various feature groups individually; [2] com-\npares prediction of dimensional and categorical annotation\nand highlights the relevance of single features without re-\nporting their actual performance. In summary, the majority\nof research still deals with classiÔ¨Åcation [8, 12, 14, 19], to\nrefer to a few recent studies. Besides, to deal with relia-\nbility issues of human music mood annotation [9], we in-\ntroduce the evaluator weighted estimator (EWE) [3] to the\nMusic Information Retrieval domain and evaluate its inÔ¨Çu-\nence on regression performance. The EWE has been pro-\nposed as a weighted decision taking into account reliabili-\nties of individual annotators for emotion recognition from\nspeech [3]. Furthermore, we extend late fusion approaches\nsuch as [8] by considering the regression performance of\nsingle modalities on the development set for determination\nof fusion weights, in analogy to the EWE used for reaching\na robust ground truth estimate.\nWe evaluate our system on the ‚ÄúNow That‚Äôs What I Call\nMusic!‚Äù (NTWICM) database introduced in [19], contain-\ning 2 648 songs annotated by four listeners on 5-point scales\nfor perceived arousal and valence on song level. In con-\n759Poster Session 6\ntrast to some earlier work on music mood recognition such\nas [2], no instance pre-selection has been performed in or-\nder to simulate real-life conditions where an automatic sys-\ntem has to deal with non-prototypical instances, in particu-\nlar those characterized by low emotional intensity [10]. Our\nevaluation measure is the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient between the\nregression output and the estimated continuous ground truth.\nThe remainder of this contribution brieÔ¨Çy describes the\nevaluation database (Section 2), with a particular focus on\nannotation reliability, and the acoustic and linguistic fea-\ntures used for automatic regression (Section 3). Results of\nextensive regression runs are given in Section 4 before con-\ncluding in Section 5.\n2. NTWICM DATABASE\n2.1 Data Set\nFor building the NTWICM music database the compilation\n‚ÄúNow That‚Äôs What I Call Music!‚Äù (U. K. series, volumes\n1‚Äì69) is selected. It contains 2 648 titles ‚Äî roughly a week\nof total play time ‚Äî and covers the time span from 1983\nto 2010. Likewise it represents very well most music styles\nwhich are popular today; that ranges from Pop and Rock\nmusic over Rap, R&B to electronic dance music as Techno\nor House. The stereo sound Ô¨Åles are MPEG-1 Audio Layer\n3 (MP3) encoded using a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a\nvariable bit rate of at least 128 kBit/s as found in many typ-\nical use-cases of an automatic mood classiÔ¨Åcation system.\nFor 1 937 of 2 648 songs in the database (cf. Sec-\ntion 2.3, Table 2) lyrics can automatically be collected\nfrom two on-line databases: In a Ô¨Årst run lyricsDB,\n(http://lyrics.mirkforce.net/) is applied, which delivers lyrics\nfor 1 779 songs, then LyricWiki, (http://www.lyricwiki.org/)\nis searched for all remaining songs, which delivers lyrics for\n158 additional songs. The only manual post-processing car-\nried out was normalization of transcription inconsistencies,\ne. g., markers for chorus lines, among the databases.\n2.2 Annotation and Reliability\nSongs were annotated as a whole, i. e., without selection of\ncharacteristic song parts, to stick to real world use cases ‚Äì\nsuch as music suggestion ‚Äì as closely as possible. Respect-\ning that mood perception is generally judged as highly sub-\njective [9], we decided for four labellers. While mood may\nwell change within a song, as change of more and less lively\npassages or change from sad to a positive resolution, anno-\ntation in such detail is particularly time-intensive. Yet, we\nare assuming the addressed music type ‚Äì mainstream pop-\nular and by that usually commercially oriented ‚Äì music to\nbe less affected by such variation as, for example, found in\nlonger arrangements of classical music. In fact, this can be\nvery practical and sufÔ¨Åcient in many application scenarios,age, g œÅ CC CC-LORO\nVal Aro Val Aro Val Aro\nA 34, m .828 .749 .827 .763 .678 .456\nB 23, m .267 .623 .304 .640 -.012 .366\nC 26, m .797 .633 .800 .656 .651 .442\nD 32, f .797 .717 .819 .733 .640 .474\nTable 1 : NTWICM Database: Raters A‚ÄìD by age and\ng(ender), and reliability of val(ence) and aro(usal) annota-\ntion by Spearman‚Äôs œÅand correlation coefÔ¨Åcient (CC) with\nmean (A‚ÄìD), as well as CC in leave-one-rater-out (LORO)\nanalysis.\nas for automatically suggestion that Ô¨Åts a listener‚Äôs mood.\nDetails on the chosen raters (three male, one female, aged\nbetween 23 and 34 years; average: 29 years) and their pro-\nfessional and private relation to music are provided in Ta-\nble 1. As can be seen, they were picked to form a well-\nbalanced set spanning from rather ‚Äònaive‚Äô assessors without\ninstrument knowledge and professional relation to ‚Äòexpert‚Äô\nassessors including a club disc jockey (D. J.). The latter can\nthus be expected to have a good relationship to music mood,\nand its perception by the audiences. Further, young raters\nprove a good choice, as they were very well familiar with\nall the songs of the chosen database. They were asked to\nmake a forced decision according to the two dimensions in\nthe mood plane assigning values in -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 for arousal\nand valence, respectively. They were further instructed to\nannotate according to the perceived mood, that is, the ‚Äòrep-\nresented‚Äô mood, not to the induced, that is, ‚Äòfelt‚Äô one, which\ncould have resulted in too high labelling ambiguity. The an-\nnotation procedure is described in detail in [19], and the an-\nnotation along with the employed annotation tool are made\npublicly available1.\nIn this study, we aim at music mood assessment in the\ncontinous domain as determined by the four raters. Thus,\na consensus has to be derived from the individual labellings\nfor valence and arousal. A continuous quantity as needed for\nregression is obtained as follows. As a Ô¨Årst step, we calcu-\nlated the agreement (reliability) of rater k‚àà{A,B,C,D}\nwith respect to the arithmetic mean label l(d)\nnfor each in-\nstancen,d‚àà{valence, arousal},\nl(d)\nn=1\n4/summationdisplay\nkl(d)\nn,k(1)\nwherel(d)\nn,k‚àà{‚àí 2,‚àí1,0,1,2}is the label assigned by rater\nkto instance n. As a measure of reliability for each k,\nwe computed the correlation coefÔ¨Åcient CC kbetween (l(d)\nn,k)\nand(l(d)\nn). Results are shown in Table 1, where we also pro-\n1http://openaudio.eu/NTWICM-Mood-Annotation.\narff\n76012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nvide the values for Spearman‚Äôs rho ( œÅ) for reference: No-\ntable differences between CC and œÅcan mainly be seen for\nthe valence annotation by rater B.\nEvidently, the reliability in terms of CC kdiffers among\nthe raters ‚Äì especially for valence, where it ranges from .828\n(rater A, club D. J.) down to .267 (rater B). Hence, as a ro-\nbust estimate of the desired ground truth mood of each in-\nstancen, we additionally considered the EWE [3], denoted\nbyl(d)\nn, in further analyses:\nl(d)\nn=1/summationtext\nkCCk/summationdisplay\nkCCkl(d)\nn,k. (2)\nWe hypothesize that the EWE provides a robust ground truth\nestimate especially for the NTWICM database with only\nfour annotators, where a single ‚Äòunreliable‚Äô annotator does\nnot simply ‚Äòaverage out‚Äô. Note that we refrain from report-\ning the agreement of the raters with the EWE, as in the EWE\ninformation about their reliability is already integrated. Fur-\nthermore, the CC of raters with the mean of allraters is ar-\nguably a slight overestimate of the true reliability, since the\nrating to be evaluated is included in the ground truth esti-\nmate. Thus, we additionally performed a ‚Äòleave-one-rater-\nout‚Äô (LORO) reliability analysis. Thereby for each rater\nkthe CC is calculated between (l(d)\nn,k)and the EWE of all\nraters except k. It turns out that human agreement is con-\nsiderably lower when measured in a LORO fashion ‚Äì partly,\nthis can be attributed to the fact that in the LORO analysis,\neach ground truth estimate is made up from only three raters.\nAgain, rater A exhibits the highest reliability whereas rater\nB is ranked last, both for valence and arousal (cf. Table 1).\n2.3 Partitioning\nWe partitioned the 2 648 songs into training, development,\nand test partitions through a transparent deÔ¨Ånition that al-\nlows easy reproducibility and is not optimized in any re-\nspect: Training and development are obtained by selecting\nall songs from odd years, whereby development is assigned\nby choosing every second odd year. By that, test is deÔ¨Åned\nusing every even year. The distributions of instances per\npartition are displayed in Table 2, together with the number\nof instances for which lyrics are missing ‚Äì it can be seen that\ntheir proportion is roughly equal for all partitions.\nOnce development was used for optimization of classi-\nÔ¨Åer parameters, the training and development sets are united\nfor training. Note that this partitioning resembles roughly\n50 % / 50 % of overall training / test in order to favor statisti-\ncally meaningful Ô¨Åndings.\n3. FEATURES\nA summary of the feature groups discussed in this study is\ngiven in Table 3. They can be roughly categorized into fea-\ntures derived from the lyrics (Sections 3.1, 3.2), the songSet # songs # lyrics\nTrain 690 515 (75 %)\nDevel 686 509 (74 %)\nTrain+Devel 1 376 1 024 (74 %)\nTest 1 272 913 (72 %)\nSum 2 648 1 937 (73 %)\nTable 2 : Partitioning of the NTWICM Database, and avail-\nability of lyrics.\nmeta-information (Section 3.3), and Ô¨Ånally the audio itself\n(Sections 3.5, 3.4, 3.6). A detailed explanation of the fea-\ntures is given in [19].\n3.1 Emotional Concepts\nSemantic features are extracted from the lyrics by the Con-\nceptNet [13] text processing toolkit, which makes use of a\nlarge semantic database automatically generated from sen-\ntences in the Open Mind Common Sense Project2. The\nsoftware is capable of estimating the most likely emotional\naffect in a raw text input, which has already been shown\nquite effective for valence prediction in movie reviews [20].\nThe underlying algorithm starts from a subset of con-\ncepts that are manually classiÔ¨Åed into one of six emo-\ntional categories (happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, sur-\nprised), and calculates the emotion of unclassiÔ¨Åed concepts\nextracted from the song‚Äôs lyrics by Ô¨Ånding and weighting\npaths which lead to those classiÔ¨Åed concepts. The algo-\nrithm yields six discrete features indicating a ranking of\nthe moods from highest to lowest dominance in the lyrics,\nand six continuous-valued features contain the correspond-\ning probability estimates.\n3.2 Linguistic Features: From Lyrics to Vectors\nLinguistic features are obtained from the lyrics by text pro-\ncessing methods proven efÔ¨Åcient for sentiment detection\n[20]. The raw text is Ô¨Årst split into words while remov-\ning all punctuation. In order to recognize different Ô¨Çex-\nions of the same word (e. g. loved ,loving ,loves should be\ncounted as love) the conjugated word has to be reduced to\nits word stem. This is done using the Porter stemming algo-\nrithm [15].\nWord occurences are converted to a vector (Bag-of-\nWords, BoW) representation where each component repre-\nsents a word stem that occurs at least 10 times. For each\nsong, the relative frequency of the stem is computed, i. e.,\nthe number of occurences is normalized by the total num-\nber of words in the song‚Äôs lyrics. The dimensionality of the\nresulting feature set is 393.\n2http://openmind.media.mit.edu/\n761Poster Session 6\n3.3 Metadata\nAdditional information about the music is sparse in this\nwork because of the large size of the music collection used:\nBesides the year of release only the artist and title informa-\ntion is available for each song. While the date is directly\nused as a numeric attribute, the artist and title Ô¨Åelds are pro-\ncessed in a similar way as the lyrics (cf. previous section):\nOnly the binary information about the occurrence of a word\nstem is retained. While the artist word list looks very spe-\nciÔ¨Åc to the collection of artists in the database, the title word\nlist seems to have more general relevance with words like\n‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚Äúfeel‚Äù or ‚Äúsweet‚Äù. In total, the size of the metadata\nfeature set is 152.\n3.4 Chords\nFor chord extraction from the raw audio data a fully auto-\nmatic algorithm as presented by Harte and Sandler [6] is\nused. Its basic idea is to map signal energy in frequency\nsub-bands to their corresponding pitch class which leads to\na chromagram or pitch class proÔ¨Åle. Each possible chord\ntype corresponds to speciÔ¨Åc pattern of tones. By comparing\nthe chromagram with predeÔ¨Åned chord templates, an esti-\nmate of the chord type (e. g., major, minor, diminished) can\nbe made. We recognize the nine chord types deÔ¨Åned in [19]\nalong with the chord base tone (e. g. C, F, G /sharp). Each chord\ntype has a distinct sound which makes it possible to asso-\nciate it with a set of moods [1]: For instance, major chords\noften correspond to happiness, minor ones to a more melan-\ncholic mood, while diminished chords are frequently linked\nto fear or suspense. For each chord name and chord type, the\nrelative frequency per song is computed and augmented by\nthe total number of recognized chords (22 features in total).\n3.5 Rhythm\nThe 87 rhythm features rely on a method presented in [17].\nIt uses a bank of comb Ô¨Ålters with different resonant fre-\nquencies covering a range from 60 to 180 bpm. The output\nof each Ô¨Ålter corresponds to the signal energy belonging to a\ncertain tempo, devliering robust tempo estimates for a wide\nrange of music. Further processing of the Ô¨Ålter output de-\ntermines the base meter of a song, i. e., how many beats are\nin each measure and what note value one beat has. The im-\nplementation used can recognize whether a song has duple\n(e. g., 2/4, 4/4) or triple (e. g., 3/4, 6/8) meter. A detailed\ndescription of the rhythm features is found in [19].\n3.6 Spectral\nSpectral features are straightforward and derived from the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the songs, which is\nmixed down to a monophonic signal.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n4.1 Setup\nIn our regression experiments we used ensembles of un-\npruned REPTrees with a maximum depth of 25 trained on\nrandom feature sub-spaces [7]. For straightforward repro-\nducibility, we relied on the open-source implementation in\nthe Weka toolkit [5].\nWe tuned the ensemble size (number of trees and sub-\nspace size) on the development set for each combina-\ntion of feature set and target (valence/arousal mean/EWE)\nto reÔ¨Çect varying sizes and complexities of the fea-\nture sets. The number of trees was chosen from\n{10,20,50,100,200,500,1 000,2 000}and the sub-space\nsize from{.01,.02,.05,.1,.2,.5}. Results of the parame-\nter tuning for selected feature groups can be seen in Fig-\nures 1 (a)‚Äì(b). As expected due to different sizes of the fea-\nture space, optimal parameters vary considerably. Interest-\ningly, the best result for the Metfeature set is obtained with\n1 000 trees consisting of only 1‚Äì2 features, corresponding\nto a sub-space size of 1 %. Note that for the smallest fea-\nture set ( Con), the number of possible trees is bounded by/parenleftbig12\n6/parenrightbig\n= 924 , so a larger number of trees will result in dupli-\ncates by the pigeon hole principle.\n76212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n10‚àí210‚àí1\n10102103Cross-correlation\nsub-space size#trees0.400.500.600.70(a)All\n10‚àí210‚àí1\n10102103\nsub-space size#trees0.300.400.500.60\n(b)Rhy\nFigure 1 : Tuning of ensemble size on CC with valence\nEWE on development set for All(a) and Rhy (b) feature\ngroups.\nCC Valence Arousal\nmean EWE mean EWE\nTrain vs. Devel .652 .680 .600 .593\nTrain+Devel vs. Test .701 .736 .613 .601\nTable 4 : Early fusion ( Allfeature set): CC of regression\non continuous valence and arousal (mean / EWE of anno-\ntators) by random sub-space learning with unpruned REP-\nTrees.

Table 4)‚Äîthis corresponds to R2statistics of .462 resp.\n.542. In that case, regression on the EWE is considerably\nmore robust than regression on the mean (absolute CC gains\nof .028 and .035 on development and test), which is proba-\nbly due to the different reliabilities of the annotators. In con-\ntrast, for arousal, where annotator reliability is more consis-\ntent, the CC with the EWE is even slightly lower (by .007\nand 0.012 absolute on development and test). In other terms,\nR2statistics of up to .36 (development) and .376 (test set)\nare obtained. For the sake of clarity, we will exclusively\nreport on CC with the EWE in the following discussion.\nAnalysis of single feature groups (Table 5) reveals that\nspectral and rhythm features contribute most to the regres-\nsion performance (CCs of .620 and .565 with the valence\nEWE on test). Chords (CC of .409) are in the mid-range\nwhile lyrics, meta information and concepts lag behind (CCs\nof .266, .241, .027). The same ranking of feature groups is\nobtained when considering the CC with the arousal EWE.\nWe conclude that the feature groups that enable robust re-\ngression can be obtained directly from the audio (chords,\nspectral and rhythm information), and thus in full realism‚Äî\nthough lyrics likely contribute to the annotation since the\nannotators were not explicitly told to ignore lyrics and all of\nthem are experienced English speakers. In fact, the CC on\nthe test set by the NoLyrics feature set (.735) is only slightly\nlower than that with the full feature set (.736).\nThe noticeable differences between the reliability of dif-\nferent modalities motivate a late fusion technique where the\nfused prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions of uni-\nmodal regressors. Thereby weights correspond to the indi-\nvidual regressors‚Äô CC on the development set, analogously\nto the EWE (Eqn. 2). Results obtained by this technique\nare shown in Table 6. On the development set, early fusion\n(cf. Table 4) is clearly outperformed for both recognition of\nvalence (CC of .693 vs. .680) and arousal (CC of .599 vs.\n.593). However, this effect is almost reversed on the test\nset, where a CC of .725 as opposed to .735 (early fusion)\nis obtained for valence; results are similar for arousal. The\nlatter result cannot be fully explained by overÔ¨Åtting fusion\n763Poster Session 6\nweights on the development set, as there is no considerable\nmismatch between the reliabilities on the development com-\npared with the test set.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nWe analyzed regression of music mood in contiuous dimen-\nsional space. Particular emphasis was laid on realism in\nthe sense of automatically retrieving textual lyric informa-\ntion automatically from the web and by chosing a music\ndatabase that is well deÔ¨Åned in its own: 69 consecutive dou-\nble CDs without pre-selection of high annotator agreement\ncases. As expected, the observed performances are clearly\nbelow the ones reported in studies on prototypical exam-\nples such as [2], yet in line with other studies on real-life\ndata sets [10, 21]. To establish a reliable gold standard,\ni. e., ground truth, we proposed the usage of the evaluator\nweighted estimator. The best individual feature group were\nrhythm features based on comb-Ô¨Ålter banks. In future work\nwe will address unsupervised and semi-supervised learning\nfor music mood analysis to exploit the huge quantities of\npopular music available on the internet.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] W.

While the mechanics of creating a multi-track\nrecording are relatively straightforward, using the available\ntools to create professional quality work requires substantial\ntraining and experience. We address one of the most fun-\ndamental processes to creating a Ô¨Ånished product, namely\ndetermining the relative gain levels of each track to produce\na Ô¨Ånal, mixed song. By modeling the time-varying mixing\ncoefÔ¨Åcients with a linear dynamical system, we train mod-\nels that predict a weight vector for a given instrument using\nfeatures extracted from the audio content of all of the tracks.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nDigital audio production tools have revolutionized the way\nwe consume, produce and interact with music on a daily ba-\nsis. Consumers have the ability to create quality recordings\nin a home studio with a relatively limited amount of equip-\nment. Although there exists a myriad of complex software\nsuites and audio editing environments, they all perform the\nsame fundamental task of multi-track recording. This pa-\nper focuses on one of the most essential steps in music pro-\nduction: multi-track mixing. The relative levels between\nthe various instruments in a song signiÔ¨Åcantly determine the\noverall sonic quality of the piece.\nIn a previous paper we introduced a supervised machine\nlearning approach for automatically mixing a set of un-\nknown source tracks into a coherent, well-balanced instru-\nment mixture using a small number of acoustic features [1].\nWe modeled the mixing coefÔ¨Åcients as the hidden states of\na linear dynamical system and used acoustic features ex-\ntracted from the audio as the output of the model. After\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.estimating the parameters of the model on the training data,\nwe predicted the time-varying weights of each instrument\nfor an unknown song using Kalman Ô¨Åltering [2].\nWe extend that approach in this paper by reducing the\nconstraints on the model and generalizing it to a larger num-\nber of instruments. One modiÔ¨Åcation to the system includes\nmodeling the weights of an individual instrument and their\nÔ¨Årst and second derivatives instead of jointly estimating the\nweights for all of the instrument tracks at once. This re-\nmoves the restriction that the test song must contain all in-\nstrument types that the model was trained on.\nAdditionally, we explore an extended feature set within\nthis framework and analyze the performance of each indi-\nvidual feature as well as combinations of features. The fea-\ntures are chosen to contain information about the total en-\nergy of the signal, energy within various frequency bands,\nspectral shape and dynamic spectral evolution.\n2. BACKGROUND\nMuch research in the area of automatic audio signal mix-\ning is devoted to applications in the context of a live per-\nformance or event. Initial research on the subject was ori-\nented toward broadcast, live panel discussion and similar en-\nvironments dealing with the human voice as the primary au-\ndio source [3]. These systems analyze the amplitude of the\naudio signal and apply adaptive gating and thresholding to\neach input signal to create a coherent sound source mixture\nof the individual tracks in addition to preventing feedback.\nMore recent work incorporates perceptual features (e.g,\nloudness) into systems designed for live automatic gain con-\ntrol and cross-adaptive equalization [4, 5]. The implemen-\ntation of the former focuses on adapting the fader level of\neach channel with the goal of achieving the same average\nloudness per channel. The latter is designed for use in live\nsettings as a tool for inexperienced users or to reduce equip-\nment setup time. The system attempts to dynamically Ô¨Ålter\nvarious frequency bands in each channel so that all channels\nare heard equally well.\nStructured audio is the representation of sound content\nwith semantic information or algorithmic models [6]. This\n621Oral Session 7: Structure Analysis and Mixing\nform of encoding allows for much higher data transmission\nrates as well as retrieval and manipulation of audio based\non perceptual models. Currently, professional music post-\nproduction is performed by a highly skilled engineer with\nyears of training. Using structured techniques, a parameter-\nized, generative version of this process that is applicable to\na variety of source audio is feasible.\nMore recent efforts focus on determining the parame-\nters used in common linear signal processing effects such\nas equalization and reverb as well as dynamic level com-\npression [7]. The authors also present a method for deter-\nmining static fader values for an entire song for each track\nin a multi-track recording session. An interface for assisting\nusers in creating mix-downs of user generated content from\nexamples of mixes produced by professional engineers is\npresented in [8].\nOther related work seeks to equalize an audio input based\non a set of descriptive perceptual terms such as bright or\nwarm [9]. Rather than attempt to navigate the complex net-\nwork of sliders and knobs in an audio interface, a user can\nspecify a high level term that describes the desired sound\nquality, and an appropriate equalization curve will be ap-\nplied. The system was developed through collecting user\nratings for audio examples and performing linear regres-\nsion to Ô¨Ånd a weighting function for a particular instru-\nment/timbre pair.\n3. MODELING FRAMEWORK\nThe dataset we use in our experiments consists of 48 multi-\ntrack songs from the RockBandR/circlecopyrtvideo game. Each song\ncontains both mono and stereo tracks for a basic rock instru-\nmentation including guitar, bass, drums and vocals. Many\nsongs may also include keyboards, horns, percussion, back-\ning vocals, strings or other instruments. Often these backing\ninstruments are contained in one audio track, making model-\ning each instrument separately rather difÔ¨Åcult. To facilitate\ncomparison between the data of each song, we Ô¨Årst prepro-\ncess the tracks to obtain a set of Ô¨Åve instrument tracks ‚Äì\nbass, drums, guitar, vocals and a backup track that contains\nall other instruments. A detailed explanation of this process\nis given in [1].\n3.1 Weight Estimation\nSince we do not have the DAW sessions used to create each\nsong, the actual fader values of the individual tracks are un-\nknown and must be estimated. To do this, the digital audio\noutput of the gaming console was recorded and aligned in a\nDAW session with the multi-track data of the corresponding\nsong. The spectrum of a frame of the output mix is assumed\nto be a linear combination of the individual input tracks ac-\ncording to\nŒ±1tU1t+Œ±2tU2t+¬∑¬∑¬∑+Œ±ktUkt=Vt (1)\nFigure 1 . System diagram detailing the ‚ÄòOne Vs. All‚Äô\nmethod for mixing coefÔ¨Åcient prediction.\nwhereVtis the spectrum of the mixed track and U{1,...,k}t\nrepresents the spectra of the individual instrument tracks.\nWe vectorize the spectrogram of each frame and use non-\nnegative least squares (NNLS) to Ô¨Ånd the mixing coefÔ¨Å-\ncients. We use NNLS as opposed to unconstrained least\nsquares estimation because multi-track mixing is an addi-\ntive process.\nThe noise in the weights is reduced through Kalman\nsmoothing [10]. It is signiÔ¨Åcant to note that while these co-\nefÔ¨Åcients produce a mix that is perceptually similar to the\noriginal track, they are not the actual ground truth weights.\nAudio examples of the original song and the reconstructed\nmix using the estimated weights are available online1.\n3.2 Weight Prediction\nWe use the weights estimated in Section 3.1 as labels in a\nsupervised machine learning task. We Ô¨Årst brieÔ¨Çy outline\nthe previous work we performed using this framework, then\nelaborate on a modiÔ¨Åed version of the model.\nIn [1] we treat the Œ±values as the hidden states of a linear\ndynamical system and our acoustic features as the output of\nthe system whose mathematical representation is\nŒ±t=AŒ±t‚àí1+wt, (2)\nyt=CŒ±t+vt (3)\nThe dynamics matrix Acontrols the temporal evolution of\nthe hidden states and Cprojects the hidden states into our\nobservation space (feature domain).

In this framework, we are constrained in terms of\nthe number and type of instruments we can use the auto-\nmatic mixing system for. Since each Œ±kis associated with\na speciÔ¨Åc instrument, omitting or adding tracks changes the\ndimension of the hidden state vector and in turn makes pre-\ndicting weights for a set of tracks that are not explicitly in\nthe form described in (4) and (5) intractable.\n3.3 ModiÔ¨Åed Prediction Scheme\nInstead of modeling the time varying mixing coefÔ¨Åcients of\nall tracks as the hidden states of the LDS, we consider only\none instrument at a time. Our new state vector consists of the\nweight for the jth track and its Ô¨Årst and second derivatives\nŒ±t=/bracketleftbig\nŒ±jÀôŒ±j¬®Œ±j/bracketrightbigT(6)\nThe derivatives of the weight vector are used to provide the\nmodel with more information about the dynamic evolution\nof the mixing coefÔ¨Åcients. Note that only the weights for\none instrument are included in the state vector. By elim-\ninating the weight values of the other instruments, we are\ntraining the model to consider only how well the current\ninstrument ‚Äòsits‚Äô in the mix, not how the weights of all in-\nstruments evolve together.\nThe output vector ytis comprised of the feature set for\nthe instrument we are trying to predict stacked with the av-Feature Description\nRMS energy Root mean square energy\nSpectral Ô¨Çux Change in spectral energy\nSpectral bandwidth Range of frequencies where most energy lies\nOctave-based sub-bands Energy in octave spaced frequency bands\nMFCC Mel-Frequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients\nSpectral centroid Mean or center of gravity of the spectrum\nSpectral peaks Energy around a local sub-band maxima\nSpectral valleys Energy around a local sub-band minima\nSlope/Intercept Parameters of a line Ô¨Åt to the spectrum of a frame\nTable 2 .

Comparing (5) to (7), we observe that in\n(7) there is no dependency on which position ( k) the features\nfor a given instrument are located. The only prior knowl-\nedge the model requires is the type of the jth instrument for\nwhich we are predicting time-varying weights. As a result,\nin this framework there is no limitation on the number or\ntype of instruments that can be mixed using the system, pro-\nvided that there exists training data for the target instrument\nj. A system diagram showing the new modeling method is\nshown in Figure 1.\nTo evaluate the efÔ¨Åcacy of this modiÔ¨Åed estimation ap-\nproach, we perform the same experiment outlined in [1] and\ncompare the results of the two methods. Using the 48 songs\nin our dataset, we perform leave-one-out cross-validation\n(LOOCV), training an LDS on 47 tracks and predicting the\nweights for the remaining track. We repeat the process us-\ning each track as a test song only once and average the mean\nsquared error (MSE) between our estimated ground truth\nvalues and our predictions from the LDS. The results are\nshown in Table 1. We refer to the method described in Sec-\ntion 3.2 as All Tracks (AT) and the modiÔ¨Åed approach in this\nsection as One Versus All (OV A).

The\nOV A method provides increased performance in terms of\nthe MSE of the weight predictions as well as increased Ô¨Çex-\nibility.

Table 2 lists the array of spec-\ntral and time domain features we selected for our experi-\nment [12‚Äì14]. The features are chosen to contain informa-\ntion about the total energy of the signal, energy within var-\nious frequency bands, spectral shape and dynamic spectral\nevolution. All experiments are performed using LOOCV on\nthe entire dataset. In the Ô¨Årst experiment, we test the per-\nformance of each individual feature using the average MSE\nover all songs as our error metric. Table 3 shows the results\nfor each feature for each track type in the dataset. There\nis no single feature that appears to be dominant for mixing\ncoefÔ¨Åcient prediction.\nUsing these results, we employ sequential feature se-\nlection to increase the performance of our system [15].\nThe best performing feature for each instrument in Table\n3 is stacked with each remaining feature, and the MSE for\nLOOCV is computed for each combination. The best fea-\nture from this result is retained and the process is repeated\nuntil all features have been used. The results of this analy-\nsis are depicted in Figure 2. The best performing number of\nfeatures for each instrument is indicated with a diamond.\nSince some of our features may contain similar informa-\ntion, adding additional features eventually becomes redun-\ndant and the increase in the size of the parameter space out-\nweighs the gain in information.\n5. RESULTS\nThe overall results for using the best performing feature en-\nsemble are detailed in Table 1. The table shows that the\nOV A approach more accurately models the mixing coefÔ¨Å-\ncients and the addition of more features greatly improves the\nresults. Mean squared error does not provide any intuition\nabout where each model fails or performs well. Figure 3\nshows a comparison between the AT and OV A models.

There is\nrelatively small deviation in the bass and guitar predictions\nfor each method on both songs. The most signiÔ¨Åcant differ-\nence is in the ability of the OV A model to track the vocal\nweights as evidenced by the relatively Ô¨Çat predictions from\nthe AT model contrasted with the OV A model predictions\nthat follow the contour of the ground truth weights.\nIn Figure 4 we observe the effect of increasing the num-\nber of features used to train the model. The predictions us-\ning the best feature for each instrument from Table 3 are\nshown in gray and the highest performing ensemble of fea-\ntures is depicted in orange. Adding features creates the most\nimprovement in the drum track where the contour and bias\nof the predictions closely follows the ground truth for both\nsongs. Although this is only a small sample of the dataset,\nthis representation informs us of improvements that can be\nmade to the system.\n6. CONCLUSION\nOur automatic multi-track mixing system predicts a set of\nweighting coefÔ¨Åcients for an instrument given an ensem-\nble of acoustic features extracted from audio content. Weimprove upon our previous modeling framework by train-\ning a separate LDS for each instrument rather than model-\ning all weight vectors within a single system. Applying the\nOne Versus All method of training removes the restrictions\nimposed by the All Tracks model and yields better perfor-\nmance in predicting the weights for all instruments.\nMoreover, we investigate the accuracy of an array of\nspectral and time-domain features on predicting the mixing\ncoefÔ¨Åcients. The improved modeling scheme and feature\nensemble chosen through sequential feature selection illus-\ntrate marked improvement over our previous results. While\nthis approach to automatic multi-track mixing works well\nfor our small dataset, in the future we plan to develop a\nlarger and more varied corpus of songs to explore how ro-\nbust the model is.\n7.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIV ATIONS\nTo date, most computational research in music has focused\non Western music. In order to further advance the state-\nof-the-art in MIR, non-Western musics, with their unique\nchallenges should be considered [16]. Such research would\nexpand our knowledge and tools immensely, allowing us\nto adapt and improve the previous work, and would open\nup new paths for musical creativity, expressivity and inter-\naction. Computational modeling of distinct musical gen-\nres will deepen our knowledge of universal versus genre-\nspeciÔ¨Åc aspects of music and it will allow us to truly evalu-\nate the generality of various modeling strategies.\nMusical improvisation is a complex phenomenon, and\nthere have been many attempts to describe and model it\n[24]. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding the ‚Äúmu-\nsic‚Äù in the current MIR research with respect to how humans\nactually perceive the it [27]. Previous work on Western\nmelodies showed that variable-length n-gram models and\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.human judgments of melodic continuation are highly cor-\nrelated [20]. We hope our research will give clues about\nhow we actually anticipate music [10].\n2. BACKGROUND\n2.1 Related Work\nComputational modeling of musical styles is not a new topic,\nand is a common tool in algorithmic composition [2, 7]. n-\ngram modeling have been extensively used in algorithmic\ncomposition [19], structure analysis [12], and music cogni-\ntion [21]. This work is an adaptation of our expressive tabla\nmodeling research [4], which is based on multiple viewpoint\nmodeling [6].\nAlthough information retrieval in world musics has only\nrecently started to attract attention in academia, there has\nbeen substantial amount of research in the Ô¨Åeld [3,8,13,26].\nIn traditional Turkish music, n-gram modeling have been\npreviously used by Alpkoc ¬∏ak and Gedik to classify makam s\n[1].\n2.2 Turkish Folk Music\nTurkish folk music is a profound music style that is the prod-\nuct of the emotions, thoughts, humor and social life of Turk-\nish people, and has been shaped by the historical events, ge-\nographical locations and migrations of the Turkish people.\nThe songs in Turkish folk music are typically anonymous,\nwhich have been carried from generation to generation as\nan oral tradition.\n2.2.1 Basic Concepts in Turkish Music Theory\nIn Western music, an octave is divided into 12 intervals.\nHowever, there is no theory that is completely agreed upon\nin Turkish music due to differences in theory and practice;\nthe suggested number of pitches in an octave ranges from\n17 to 79 [28]. Currently, education in makam based mu-\nsic is based on the-highly-criticized [25] Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek\ntheory. According to the theory, a whole tone is divided\ninto intervals named koma s, which are used to discretize an\noctave into 24 consequent tones [18]. However, in Turkish\n269Poster Session 2\nFret # Note Fret # Note Fret # Note\n0A 6C/sharp 12F/sharp3\n1B/flat 7D 13F/sharp\n2B/flat28E/flat 14 G\n3B 9E/flat215A/flat\n4C 10 E 16A/flat2\n5C/sharp311 F 17 A\nTable 1 : The notes and the fret numbers in the lowest string\ngroup of ba Àòglama in the baÀòglama tuning ./flat2and/sharp3‚Äôs indicate\nthe quarter tones.\nfolk music, there are typically 17 pitches played in an octave\ndue to selection of the instruments (Section 2.2.2), and the\nmusic is indeed explainable by makam s [25].\nMakam s can be depicted as the modes of Turkish music.\nMakam s are progressions ( seyir ) used to generate melodies\n(naÀògme).Makam s obey certain rules such as emphasizing\nthe modal centers, the use of key signatures and maintaining\ncontext-speciÔ¨Åc ascending or descending seyirs [25].\nUsul is ‚Äùthe structure of musical events which are coher-\nent with respect to time.‚Äù Usul can be roughly translated as\n‚Äùmeter.‚Äù An usul can be as short as two beats or as long\nas 128 beats, but it should always have at least one strong\nand one weak beat. Turkish music also makes a rich use of\nusuls ¬®uz(non-metered) progressions [18].\n2.2.2 Uzun Hava\nUzun hava (long tune) is a semi-improvisational melodic\nstructure in Turkish folk music. The music is usually sad;\nthe lyrics (if any) are generally about the daily struggles\nand emotions of the Anatolian people. All uzun hava s are\nusuls ¬®uz(without any meter), but there can also be usull ¬®u\n(with distinct meter) sections in between.\nThe most common instrument played in uzun hava s is\nbaÀòglama, a traditional Turkish instrument from lute family.\nIt has 17 notes in an octave [25] (Table 1). The strings are\ngrouped into three having 3, 2 and 2 strings from the highest\nto the lowest. The instrument is a transposing instrument,\nand the tuning ( d¬®uzen) of these strings may change for dif-\nferent songs. Moreover, the frets are tied to the fretboard\n(sap), so that microtonal adjustments in the temperament\ncan be easily made.\n3. UZUN HA V A HUMDRUM DATABASE\nFor the experiments, the authors, with the help of Prof. Erdal\nTuÀògcular, have built the Uzun Hava Humdrum Database1.\nA Humdrum based syntax called **kern format was chosen\nfor its readability and broad search, comparison and editing\n1The Uzun Hava Humdrum database is available online at\nhttp://sertansenturk.com/uploads/uzunHavaHumdrumDatabasecapabilities [9]. In order to obtain the symbolic data, all of\ntheuzun hava s with scores (a total of 123 scores) from The\nTurkish Radio and Television Corporation‚Äôs (TRT) Turkish\nFolk Music Database were chosen2. The TRT database\nconsists of the extended Western staff notations saved in .tiff\nimage format.\nIn the analysis of world musics, there are some intrinsic\nproblems of using symbolic notation such as accepting no-\ntation as an adequate means of representing improvisation\n(especially in oral traditions) and human errors in the tran-\nscriptions [17]. Therefore, it might be problematic to make\ndeductions based on symbolic notations, and audio analysis\nmight be more appropriate. Yet, audio analysis is gener-\nally not as easy and straightforward as processing symbolic\ndata. Thus, it is more suitable take the initial steps in com-\nputational modeling with human annotations, even if they\nare not perfect.\nThe scores in the TRT database were read into Finale\n2010 by using the built-in SmartScore 5 Lite, exported into\nMusicXML 2.0 format, and then converted to **kern nota-\ntion by using xml2hum [23]. After cleaning-up, grace notes,\nfermatas, quarter tone accidentals and meter changes were\nadded to the **kern Ô¨Åles. In order to comply with the stan-\ndard humdrum notation, instead of creating our own sym-\nbols, we have chosen to indicate the quarter tones as devia-\ntions in cents in a second spine. In the TRT database, there\nare accidentals, which have different koma deviations from\nthe same tone ( B/flat2,B/flat3,B/flat4etc.) However, as the most\ncommon instrument played in uzun havas is ba Àòglama and it\nhas 17 notes per octave, we have chosen to map all koma\nvalues lying between semitones into a single quarter tone\nwith 50 cent deviation from the original note and match the\n17-tone scale.\nUsuls ¬®uz(non-metered) sections in uzun havas are treated\nas cadenzas such that the sections start with ‚Äù*MX/X‚Äù, in-\ndicating the following notes will be played in a non-metered\nfashion and each note is proceeded by the letter ‚ÄùQ‚Äù, which\nis used to indicate grupettos in **kern format [9]. Finally,\nthe name, region, makam , accidentals and usul are printed\nto the start of the Ô¨Åle as comments.\nCurrently 64 songs have been encoded, with a total of\n6613 notes, in 8 makam s from different regions of Anatolia\nand Azerbaijan. However, we should note that the makam s\nof the songs are biased towards H ¬®useyni (82 songs) and Hi-\ncaz (17 songs). This is expected as uzun hava s are usually\nplayed in H ¬®useyni [11].\n2The TRT Turkish folk music database is available on-\nline at ‚Äù T¬®urk M ¬®uzik K ¬®ult¬®ur¬®un¬®un Hafƒ±zasƒ±‚Äù Score Archive\n(http://www.sanatmuziginotalari.com/), which is freely accessible via\nhttp://devletkorosu.com/\n27012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n4. COMPUTATIONAL MODELING\nParallel to Conklin and Pearce‚Äôs research [6,20], the compu-\ntational framework in this work incorporates multiple view-\npoints modeling with both long-term and short-term mod-\nels. Variable-length Markov modeling (VLMM) is used to\nmodel the sequences, and the training data is stored as Pre-\ndiction SufÔ¨Åx Trees. The evaluation of the system is done\nby entropy-based calculations. The modeling and evalua-\ntion framework was implemented in C++ as an external ob-\nject in Max/MSP along with supporting patches [4]. To the\nbest knowledge, this research is the Ô¨Årst attempt to model\nmelodic sequences in traditional Turkish music.\n4.1 Markov Modeling\nAnthorder Markov model is a causal, discrete random pro-\ncess where the probabilities of the next state depends only\non the probabilities of the current and the previous states.\nIf the sequences are directly observable, i.e. the states are\nvisible, most of the problems can be directly solved by deal-\ning with transition probabilities. A (n‚àí1)thMarkov model\ncan be represented by n-grams, which are subsequences of\nlength n.n-grams are a commonly used to probabilistically\nmodel sequences of elements such as phonemes in speech,\nletters in a word, or musical notes in a phrase [15].\nIncreasing the order of the Markov model might reveal\nmore details about the data stream. However, speciÔ¨Åc pat-\nterns will get extremely uncommon as the order of the model\ngets higher, even with very big data sets. Moreover, while\nobserving speciÔ¨Åc patterns is very helpful, integrating lower\norder models to the system might also be useful to give some\nregularity. In order to capture the generality of lower or-\nder models and speciÔ¨Åcity of the sequences in higher order\nmodels, we can use an ensemble of Markov models with\ndifferent orders to form a variable length Markov model\n(VLMM). The variable length of memory in contrast with\nÔ¨Åxed Markov model yields a rich and Ô¨Çexible description\nof sequential data. In this work, to combine the predictions\nfrom different orders, we are using a smoothing method we\ntermed 1/N. In the 1/Nsmoothing method, weights for\nthe n-th order model are given by1\n(maxOrder ‚àín+1), giv-\ning greater relative weight to predictions of higher orders.\nMoreover, the VLMMs are efÔ¨Åciently stored in Prediction\nSufÔ¨Åx Trees [22] (PSTs) for performance reasons (Figure\n1).\nWhile increasing order would allow us to obtain more\nspeciÔ¨Åc patterns, it also brings the so-called zero frequency\nproblem [5]. As the order nincreases, the maximum num-\nber of possible n-grams would increase to nk, where k is\nthe number of the possible symbols. However, even in large\ndatabases, most of the sequences will not be present or seen\nvery few. This sparsity issue brings a limitation to the or-\nder of an n-gram. In order to deal with the zero frequencyViewpoint Explanation\nDuration Duration of the note\nNote Midi number corresponding to the\nnote\nNoteWCents Viewpoint denoting the ‚Äùtrue‚Äù sym-\nbol in Turkish folk music in note\nand cent deviation, i.e. the Ô¨Çoating\nmidi number\nNote‚äóDur Cross type combining note and du-\nration\nNoteWCents‚äóDur Cross type combining note with\ncent deviation and duration\nTable 2 : Viewpoints used in the experiment.\nproblem, an escape probability for each level of the trie is\nreserved. The escape probability of each level is calculated\nase(n) =T1(n)\nN(n), where T1is the number of symbols that\nhave occurred exactly once and Nis the total number of ob-\nservations so far. When an event, which has never occurred\nbefore, is observed, the escape probability is returned in-\nstead of 0.\n4.2 Multiple Viewpoints\nA multiple viewpoints system [6,20] separates a musical se-\nquence to independent parallel representations such as pitch,\nrhythm, instrument, key changes. The next sequence is pre-\ndicted based on the information incorporated from these view-\npoints. Denoting music in multiple representations can be\nuseful to predict the next symbol when one of the repre-\nsentations might be suitable for that particular sequence,\nwhereas another representation is useful in other situations.\nAs an example, scale degree would be very useful if all the\nmusical context is in the same key, however melodic interval\nmight prove more suitable if the predictions are required in\na transposed key. There can also be cross-type viewpoints,\nwhich are generated by mapping the symbols in two or more\nof the parallel representations into unique tokens: for exam-\nple for Notes‚äóDurations; a quarter C, a quarter D, a eighth\nC will all be mapped to different symbols. We use 5 view-\npoints in our experiment: Durations, Notes, NoteWCents,\nNote‚äóDur and NoteWCents ‚äóDur (Table 2).\nA common limitation of training the predictive models\nover large amount of data is that it renders the model too\ngeneral to effectively predict patterns specic to the current\nsong: if the song has a peculiar phrasing repeated through-\nout, due to the phrase having a small probability in the train-\ning database, the patterns generated might be irrelevant. In\norder to obtain predictions which are trained over a partic-\nular style and also sounds like a speciÔ¨Åc song, we use a\nlong-term-model (LTM) built on the entire training set and\n271Poster Session 2\n(a) Ending of U0368\n.152\nC\n.152\nD\n.466\nD\n12\nD\n.51\nC\n12\nB‚ô≠\n11\nB‚ô≠2\n2\nE\n11\nR\n.51\n.21\nB‚ô≠22\nC1\nE\nD\n11\nD\n.51\n.4 .2\nR\n.51\nD\n11\nE\n.51\nD\n.51E\n.152\n2\nD\n1\nR\n.081\n1\nE\n1\nD\n11\nD\n.21\n(b) Prediction SufÔ¨Åx Tree\nFigure 1 : The ending of U0368 with the repeat sign taken out and the Prediction SufÔ¨Åx Tree representing the Markov models\nof Notes-with-Cents viewpoint with a maximum order of 2, trained on these two measures.

Only symbols up to the current\ntime are used in the STM; looking ahead is not permitted\nwhen making a prediction.\nWhen a prediction is to be made at a given time-step,\nthe LTM and STM are combined and normalized to a single\npredictive distribution for each of the viewpoints. Given the\nsymbols, S={s1, s2, ..., s N}forming the probability dis-\ntribution, the probability distribution is weighted inversely\nproportional to the entropy [6]. The weight of the proba-\nbility distribution of a model is given as œâm/defineslog2(N)\nHm,\nand the entropy of the probability distribution of each model\nis deÔ¨Åned as Hm/defines‚àí/summationtextN\nk=1Pm(sk) log2(Pm(sk)), where\nPm(sk)is the probability of the symbol, sk, at the time step,\nt.\n5. EV ALUATION\nLeave-one-out cross-validation was performed on each of\nthe 64 songs in the Uzun Hava Humdrum database . During\nthe experiment, each song is picked as the testing data, and\nLTM is trained over the other songs. STM is built while\nthe testing data is fed to the system. At each time step t,\nthe true symbol is noted. Then the predictions carried in the\nprevious step t‚àí1are checked, and, ptthe probability of the\ntrue symbol at tis recorded. From the probabilities, cross-\nentropy [14] is calculated at the song level and through all\nexperiments.Cross-entropy is a common domain-independent approach\nused for evaluating the quality of model predictions, and it is\npreferable to symbol recognition rate in predictive systems\n[6, 20]. It is deÔ¨Åned as: Hc=‚àí/summationtextn\nt=1ptlog2(pt)3. If the\nprobability distribution pis unknown, under the assumption\nof uniform probability distribution ( pt=1\nn, where nis the\nnumber of predictions throughout the experiment), cross-\nentropy can be approximated by Hc‚âà‚àí1\nn/summationtextn\nt=1log2(pt).\nLater cross-entropy is converted to average perplexity, which\nis a measure of the number of choices that the model has\npicked the true symbol [14]. Perplexity is deÔ¨Åned as P=\n2H. We also report median perplexity in addition to average\nperplexity. The prior probabilities of the symbols are used to\nobtain a baseline for evaluating perplexity results. In other\nwords, perplexity of the 0thorder model LTM is used as the\nbaseline.\n6. RESULTS\nDuring the experiments, average and median perplexities\nover the whole dataset and in the song-level are recorded for\nSTM, LTM and combined models with different orders4.\nTable 3 shows that for order 14, STM always gives the most\n3Notice that the deÔ¨Ånition of cross-entropy is very similar to the entropy\ndeÔ¨Åniton in Section 4.2. However, entropy is calculated from the proba-\nbilities of each possible symbol at a given time, whereas cross-entropy is\ncalculated from the chosen predictions at each time step.\n4The complete set of results and signiÔ¨Åcance tests is available at\nhttp://sertansenturk.com/uploads/publications/senturk2011UzunHava\n27212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n0124 9 14 19 24 292.533.544.555.566.5\nOrderPerplexity\n  \nSTMCombinedLTMPriorsFigure 2 : Average perplexity for duration prediction using\nLTM, STM and combined models for orders 0-29\nconÔ¨Ådent results, while combining STM with LTM does not\nactually help predictions. STM has an average perplexity\nof 2.96, 4.13, 4.16, 6.68 and 6.69 for Duration, Note and\nNoteWCents, Note ‚äóDur and NoteWCents ‚äóDur respectively.\nComparing to the average baseline perplexities (6.12, 11.9,\n12.71, 171.76, 148.39), there is a remarkable decrease. The\npower of STM is even more obvious in the cross types Note ‚äóDur\nand NoteWCents‚äóDur, where the LTM gives perplexities of\n30.17 and 31.84.\nAnother interesting remark is adding the cent informa-\ntion during prediction results in a slight increase in per-\nplexity. For the 14thorder model, the average perplexi-\nties in the STM are 4.13, 4.16 for Note and NoteWCents,\nand 6.68, 6.69 for Note ‚äóDur and NoteWCents ‚äóDur respec-\ntively, meaning the system can effectively predict notes with\nquarter tone accidentals.\nFigure 2 shows that the perplexity decreases monoton-\nically with increasing order, as expected. STM gives the\nlowest perplexities in every order. It is also seen that there\nis only a slight change in perplexity after order 14, therefore\nchecking back more than 14 durations is unnecessary. This\noptimum order is true for all of the viewpoints.\nWhen the average perplexities are checked song by song,\nit was observed that some songs had exceptionally higher\nperplexities for LTM and Combined models. Upon inspect-\ning, it was observed that the system was not able to predict\nthe notes properly in the songs with makam s which are only\nrepresented with a few songs. Similarly the songs which\nincluded a lot of triplets, double dotted, 64thnotes were\nharder to predict. On the other hand, the latter problem\nalso affected STM, because the Duration viewpoint in these\nsongs presented a vast symbol space and thus smaller prior\nvalues, rendering the next symbol harder to predict.7. DISCUSSION\nThe results suggest that uzun hava form can be effectively\nmodeled using VLMMs. Between the perplexities obtained\nfrom the LTM, STM and Combined models with a maxi-\nmum order of 14 and viewpoint, there is a signiÔ¨Åcant5de-\ncrease in confusion, and STM outperforms both LTM and\nthe Combined model. The success of STM over LTM sug-\ngests the songs have strong local patterns. Strong patterns\nare easy to be captured and predicted by the STM; how-\never being a more general model, LTM cannot capture and\nprioritize song-related patterns as good as STM. This result\nwas expected, because in uzun hava s note and the duration\nrepetitions commonly occur during the improvised part and\nmelodies are generally repeated during vocal sections.\nOne of the most important observations is that extend-\ning the possibilities in target pitches from Western music\nto Turkish music only slightly increases perplexity values.\nWhen the quarter tones are included, i.e. the symbol in-\ndicating both the quarter tone and the neighboring tone is\ndecoupled to create two unique symbols, almost all of the\ncounts accumulate on the one note. Additionally, by in-\nspecting perplexities note-by-note, it is easily seen that the\nquarter tones such as B/flat2andF/sharp3, are easily distinguished\nfrom their neighbor tones, i.e. B/flatandF/sharp. This shows\nthat transcriptions strictly obey the key signature of their\nmakam s, and multiple viewpoint system is able to model\nthe context-speciÔ¨Åc pitches in makam s, and distinguish the\nnotes from the neighboring notes present in Western music\nvirtually without any penalty. Indeed, the selection of mul-\ntiple viewpoints might be crucial for the success. For ex-\nample, the cent deviation information cannot be used with-\nout crossing pitch related viewpoints such as absolute note\nor scale degree. For a generative system, decoupling them\nmight still give good average perplexities, however when the\nnote and the cent deviation are predicted independently from\neach other, the results might introduce notes with wrong ac-\ncidentals, disrupting the melodic intervals and the makam\nstructure.\nIn future work, we would like to include more viewpoints\nincorporating fermata, usul, scale degree, melodic interval,\ncontour and try crossing these viewpoints, to obtain better\nperplexities in prediction. We would also like to generate\nMedium Term Models (MTM), each one of which will be\ntrained on a single makam . Testing will be carried with the\nMTM of the same makam . Using this approach, we hope to\nÔ¨Ånd and predict makam based patterns with better perplex-\nity. Also, as mentioned in Section 3, extending the frame-\nwork to variable-length hidden Markov Models (VLHMMs)\nfor audio analysis is a necessary step for a more relevant as-\nsessment of uzun hava s.\n5The claim means, it is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 0.01 level as deter-\nmined by a multiple comparison test using the Tukey-Cramer statistic.\n273Poster Session 2\nDuration Note NoteWCents Note ‚äóDur NoteWCents ‚äóDur\nAverage Median Average Median Average Median Average Median Average Median\nPriors 6.12 3.76 11.9 7.97 12.71 7.98 171.76 171.32 148.39 148.16\nLTM 3.88 2.23 5.56 4.13 5.87 4.21 30.17 20.06 31.84 21.21\nCombined 3.55 1.93 4.64 3.17 4.70 3.21 15.67 10.40 16.23 10.68\nSTM 2.96 1.94 4.13 2.96 4.16 3.00 6.68 5.30 6.69 5.30\nTable 3 : Average and median perplexities for Duration, Note, NoteWCents, Note ‚äóDur and NoteWCents ‚äóDur for order 14\n8.

INTRODUCTION In the last decade there has been great progress in the field of Music Information Retrieval, but the rate of improve-ment in most retrieval tasks, like the ones evaluated within the MIREX1 initiative, is c l e a r l y  s l o w i n g  d o w n .  We are starting to see the limits of the current signal processing and machine learning approaches and efforts are being made to find new ways to advance in terms of the currently identi-fied problems. However, maybe more importantly, there are many relevant problems that have not yet been looked at for which current methodologies may not work at all. For these new problems, it is even more important to concentrate on new research approximations f o r  t h e  c o m p u t a t i o n a l  p r oc-                                                1 http://www.music-ir.org/mirex  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  essing of music information. But, w h ich approximations should we use and what new problems should we look into?     The most general and common approaches used in music information processing a r e  b a s e d  o n d a t a  m o d e l i n g; they start from large data repositories and use signal processing and machine learning techniques to construct models. We should combine these a p p r o a c hes w i t h  o t h e r  r e s e a r c h  methodologies, like the ones coming from Musicology, Cognition or Human Computer Interaction. The approaches coming from Musicology develop models originating from music theory in which a thorough formalization contributes to an understanding of the theory itself, its predictions, and its scope. On the other hand, the approaches coming from Cognition aim at constructing theories of music cognition, formalizing the mental processes involved in listening to and performing music. The approaches than have been de-veloped by the Human-Computer Interaction research community focus on the users and bring in methodologies coming from behavioral sciences. There is a need to expand the information modeling methodologies but we should do it with a cross-fertilization approach.     Making sense of music is much more than decoding and parsing an incoming stream of sound waves into higher-level objects such as onsets, notes, melodies and harmonies. Music is embedded in a rich web of cultural, historical, commercial, technological and social contexts that influ-ence how it is produced, disseminated and perceived. For example, many qualities or categorizations attributed to a piece of music by listeners cannot solely be explained by the content of the audio signal itself. It is thus clear that high-quality automatic music understanding and description can only be achieved by taking into account information sources that are external to the actual music signals.      Despite recent efforts by the MIR research community to open up towards non-western music [1] the major focus has been on the study of a few aspects of the western commer-cial music of the past few decades. This music repertoire has conditioned the problems that we are working on and thus the solutions obtained. If we study other aspects, and especially other types of music, we will find new interest-ing problems to be solved that will require new methodolo-gies and new solutions.      For the development of music information models, it is of great advantage to work with musical repertoires, thus \n151Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\n   musical cultures, that have a classical tradition and for which there is a relevant body o f  a c a d e m i c  s t u d i e s a v a il-able. Despite the trend towards a musical monoculture [2] there are robust music cultures with a classical tradition in places like China, India, Turkey, Indonesia, or in the Arab world, traditions that form a counterpoint to the western music context. A few of these musics have excellent musi-cological and cultural studies available; they maintain per-formance practice traditions and they exist within real so-cial contexts. Thus, some of these traditions can be an ex-cellent ground on which to build new i nf or ma t i on mode l s  and the means to challenge the dominant western-centered information paradigms. If we are able to describe and for-malize the music of these cultures we might open up the current information models in a way to better capture the richness of our world's music [3].     CompMusic, a research project funded by the European Research Council, was born from these concerns and from the realization that unless we do something, we might lose our world's cultural richness. What the European coloniza-tion of many parts of the world did not completely achieve, that is, to westernize their cultures, will now happen by the global use of our western-centric information technologies. These information technologies, and even more, the future technologies emerging from current research, will have a great impact on the way we maintain, access, and use t he world's information resources, and thus they will condition the survival of that information and of the cultures that pro-duce it. Unless the information technologies support the di-versity of cultural perspectives that exists in the world, we will slowly lose our wonderful world cultures.     It could be argued that there is no need to look outside western music to find new problems with which to improve our MIR techniques. It is completely true: there are many aspects of our classical, folk and other western music tradi-tions for which current MIR methodologies do not work. But it is also true that when we try to analyze some of the non-western classical traditions, our research limitations become even more obvious, and it might be easier to look at the problems with a fresh perspective, without being con-taminated by our traditional view on western music. At the same time, the opportunity to help bring new musical tradi-tions into the world of Music Computing is a very reward-ing task. 2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES The main objective of the CompMusic project is to pro-mote and develop multicultural perspectives in Music Computing research. We want to identify music problems coming from culture-specific contexts and work on solu-tions that might result in new computational methodologies of interest for a wide variety of music information process-ing problems.     In music computing research there is a need to advance in the description and formalization of music with the aim to make it more accessible to computational approaches. In this project we will work on finding ways to reduce the known gap between audio signal descriptions and semanti-cally meaningful music concepts. B u t  we  b e l i e v e  t hat we will only make progress if we approach this issue by com-bining academic disciplines, such as Information Process-ing, Computational Musicology, Music Cognition and Human-Computer Interaction, thus using both qualita-tive/quantitative methodologies and scientific/engineering approaches. We also need to work with a variety of infor-mation sources, s u c h  a s  a u d i o  f e a t u r e s ,  s y m b o l i c  s c o r e s ,  text commentaries, or user evaluations. Therefore, we need to open up the research methodologies being used.     CompMusic will take a cultural approach, meaning that information modeling techniques will be developed for specific music repertories with emphasis on their cultural contexts. To model a musical repertoire we need to under-stand and model the music together with the user commu-nity that creates, enjoys and supports that particular music.     An important consideration in a  c u l t u r a l-specific re-search approach is the issue of who should be involved. We need to involve different cultural perspectives. We be-lieve that is not possible to carry out such a project solely with a research group immersed in a cultural context dif-ferent to t h e  o n e  t o  b e  s t u d i e d .  C o m p M u s i c  w i l l  i n v o l v e experts, research teams and users immersed in the musical cultures being studied.      Given the availability of musicological/cultural studies and our existing collaborations with researchers and ex-perts within diverse m u s i c a l  c u l t u r e s ,  in CompMusic we will s t u d y  a r t  m u s i c  t r a d i t i o n s  i n  India ( H i n d u s t a n i  a n d  Carnatic), Turkey (Ottoman), North Africa ( A n d a l u s i a n ) ,  and China (Han). All these traditions offer large and useful information sources from which to d e v e l o p  o u r  p r o j e c t .  However, knowing that we will not be able to cover it all with the same depth, we have decided to first focus on the Hindustani, Carnatic and Ottoman traditions, and progres-sively incorporate specific aspects of the other cultures.     The Hindustani and Carnatic music traditions of the In-dian subcontinent offer the possibility to study relevant problems in all aspects of interest to this project. Their in-struments, such as the Tambura, the Veena or the Sitar, have been built to emphasize sonic characteristics that are quite different to those of the typical western musical in-struments. The concepts of Raga and Tala are completely different to the western concepts used to describe melody and rhythm, thus their understanding and computational description requires new approaches. Their particular im-provisatory nature based on the Ragas makes these reper-toires very alive and constantly evolving. The musical scores used in both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions serve a different purpose to those of western music and thus have to be studied differently. The tight musical and sonic relationship between the singing voice, the other me-lodic instruments, and the percussion accompaniment within a piece, requires going beyond the analytical and \n15212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   modular approaches commonly used in MIR. The special and participatory communication established between per-formers and audience in concerts, offers great opportunities to study issues of social cognition. The specific differences between Hindustani and Carnatic traditions in all the as-pects mentioned permit the study of musical and cultural differentiation issues. Even though we will only be able to tackle some of these problems in this project, we hope to encourage other researchers to study many of the others.     Ottoman art music is very much in the intersection of many music traditions. The Turkish culture is at the junc-tion of European and Asian cultures, and its musics reflect this geo-strategic position. The makam and its performance practice, the basis for the melodic organization of Ottoman music, offer a very rich source of microtonal studies, and there is already extensive theoretical work on its character-istic non-equal-tempered pitch organization. Its complex rhythmic patterns also challenge the audio analysis ap-proaches currently used in MIR. This music culture offers a great context in which to study the open debate in many music traditions on the relevance of theory versus practice in the understanding of a given music repertoire. The adap-tation of the western music notation to fit the microtonal aspects of their music, together with other European music influences, also offer a challenging set of musical style characterization problems. It is remarkable that despite all the cultural influences and political pressures, Ottoman art music has maintained a strong personality and an active social context. In fact, it is a music that has influenced many music traditions of both Europe and the Middle East, an aspect that also deserves a thorough study.     Andalusi music can be traced back to the time when the Arabs had a flourishing culture in Al-Andalus (now part of Spain) for many centuries. T h i s  m u s i c  t r a d i t i o n  h a d  t o  move its main center to North Africa when the Arabs were forced to leave Al-Andalus at the end of the 15th century. These historical and geographical developments give us very interesting cultural context problems to be studied. Andalusi music shares many fundamental characteristics with Ottoman tradition, for example the maqams used are very much related to the Ottoman makams. Thus, the com-parative study of these two traditions should be very fruit-ful. Also the fretless Oud, a preeminent instrument upon which most of the theoretical studies of this music tradition have been based, can give us relevant insights into the characteristics of the music. The approach to this classical tradition is more difficult for us than the others given the lack of research activity in the Arab countries of North Af-rica related to computational musicology. It will be diffi-cult to find collaborators for this project in these countries.     The other music culture that we want to study, the Han music of China, is also an amazing source of information processing problems. The relationship between language and music in a culture that has a tonal language offers in-teresting research problems. The importance of the tradi-tional philosophies and nature in all Chinese classical art forms gives a completely different context to the Han mu-sic. For example, the concept of emotion in this music has a different meaning to the one used in the west, and the so-cial function of the music is also very different. From all the cultures that we want to study, the Han culture is the one that has had the least contact with the western aca-demic world and most musicological studies have been published only in Mandarin and available only in China. Thus, collaboration with researchers and experts immersed in that culture is even more important.     Apart from the issues that can be studied on each music repertoire, it is very relevant to work on the problems that arise from comparative studies. Typically, the available comparative studies focus on the comparison between any music cultures and western classical music. But it is impor-tant to also make comparative studies between the different non-western musical cultures. For example, it is interesting to compare the Indian concept of raga with the Ottoman concept of makam, or the improvisatory strategies used in Indian music with the ones used also in Ottoman music. In fact, all the musical cultures selected in this project were part of what is known as the Silk Road. This was a network of trade routes across the Asian continent that connected East, South, and Western Asia with the Mediterranean world, as well as North, East, and Northeast Africa and Europe, for almost 3,000 years. This trade connection had a great impact on the development of all these musical cul-tures and it is thus fascinating to understand these mutual influences. In this project, we will promote a tight collabo-ration between the researchers working in the different countries and on the different culture-specific problems in order to understand these cross-cultural issues. 3. PROJECT TASKS The culture-specific problems on which we will start work-ing are not yet defined; in fact, this is now the main work in progress, together with putting together the initial research team. So far we ha ve  de f i ne d t he  ma i n general and trans-versal tasks and research approaches that we will use to tackle our ambitious aims. These tasks are: (1) to gather and organize audio recordings, metadata, descriptions, scores, plus all the needed contextual information of the selected music repertories; (2) to identify and study the re-quired musicological references in order to understand the chosen repertories within their cultural context; (3) to de-sign the ontologies needed to annotate and analyze t h e  gathered music collections; (4) to work on audio content analysis approaches to help describe the music collections chosen; (5) to work on a social-computing approach to characterize users and communities, modeling their musical preferences and behaviors; and (6) to develop systems that, by integrating the results of this project, can show the rele-vance of this research approach for the discovery of our world's music. \n153Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\n   \n Figure1. General project tasks. 3.1 Data gathering A major issue in the gathering and organization of the rele-vant information f o r  t h i s p r o j e c t  i s  t h e  data formats used. Most databases and protocols that we have used in previous information processing projects were designed for housing western pop music. As a result, important information would be lost if we just used the same schemas to organize the types of music that this project works on. We will con-vert our current framework into a more freely structured database, based on RDF1 (Resource Description Frame-work) and graph database technologies. This will enhance the storage system‚Äôs support for heterogeneous data and allow for the flexible addition of new data as it becomes available. We also want to contribute and take advantage of the existing online data repositories that use open licenses, like Wikipedia ( g e n e r a l  e n c y c l o p e d i a ), MusicBrainz ( C D s  metadata), Mendeley (bibliographical references), or Free-sound (audi o cl i ps)2. The goal is to be active in the Open Data Movement3 promoting it within our research commu-nity.     We will also have to make some recordings and carry out fieldwork i n  order to gather specific data with which to tackle some of the identified research problems. A l l  t h i s  data will be made available through the existing open re-positories, or, i f  n o t  a p p r o p r i a t e, i t  w i l l  b e p l a c e d  o n  t h i s project's website, also using open licenses. The CompMusic website4 is u s e d  both as this p r o j e c t's d i s s e mi n a t i o n  p o r t a l  and a s  a  c o l l a b o r a t i v e  f r a m e w o r k  in w h i c h  a n y o n e  i n t er-ested in the objectives of this project can get involved and contribute information.                                                 1 http://www.w3.org/RDF 2 http://wikipedia.org, http://musicbrainz.org, http://mendeley.com, http://freesound.org 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data 4 http://compmusic.upf.edu 3.2 Musicological studies There is no lack of musicological research on t h e  chosen musical cultures, e.g. [4], and we need to study it to under-stand the musical specificities of each repertoire, the simi-larities and differences between the selected music cultures, and what can distinguish them from classical western cul-ture. Each classical music tradition has developed its own instruments, compositional styles, performance practices, social uses, and contexts. However, we find very different points of view, sometimes opposing ones, in existing litera-ture, a n d  we will be c o llaborating wi t h  mu s i c o l o g i s t  f r o m the different music cultures in order to understand those points of view and to be able to develop appropriate musi-cological perspectives for our identified problems.      An important part of the traditional m u s i c o l o g i c a l  re-search of western music is based on the study of symbolic representations, scores, and given that our chosen reper-toires are mainly based on oral traditions, t h eir e x i s t ing symbolic representations have been studied much less. There is some work on the extension and use of digital rep-resentations like the Humdrum toolkit5 or MusicXML6 to analyze non-western music notations that we want to con-tinue. This type of analysis is very complementary to that which is audio-based and can be used to study some com-positional and semantic aspects of music.      The development of a musicological framework i s  f un-damental to properly contextualizing most  of  our r esear ch work. In particular, to identify the relevant problems to be studied, to agree on the terminology to use for the different culture-specific musical concepts, to balance the theoretical with the practical perspectives that will be involved in the different problems, and also to interpret the computational results obtained. 3.3 Ontologies design To process and share information in open environments we need a common understanding of the meaning of the data, thus we need to specify how concepts and terms of a given domain are understood, specifications that are known as ontologies. For example, Music Ontology7 [5] is being de-veloped by an open community of experts a s  a f o rmal framework for dealing with music-related information on the Semantic Web, including editorial, cultural and acoustic information. It was started with the goal of capturing t h e  musical production process, but we propose to extend it to express the variety of concepts that will be indentified in the study of the selected musical cultures. We will also ex-plore the approaches coming from what is known as emer-gent semantics [6] in order to develop ontologies from our gathered data repositories and from mining music-specific                                                 5 http://musicog.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum 6 http://www.recordare.com/musicxml 7 http://musicontology.com \n15412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   websites (e.g., music magazines, deep musical discussion forums, or reputed blogs about music).     As soon as we take a culture-specific approach in t h e  study of music, the issues of terminology and language be-come very important. We will have to develop multi-language ontologies from which to capture the musical concepts used by the different cultures, a task that will be done by musical experts. But we will have to deal with the diversity of meanings that a single term may have within a single tradition or the fact that different terms can s i g n i f y  the same or very similar meanings within that same culture.  3.4 Audio description The extraction of musically and culturally meaningful fea-tures from audio recordings of different music repertoires requires introducing new approaches, and for sure, extend-ing the existing s i g n a l  a n a l y s i s  t e c h n i q u e s  a n d  m a c h i n e learning methods. The fact that the music traditions chosen in this project have fundamental differences from western music traditions, such as different musical instruments, tun-ing systems, performance styles, or musical forms, imply that at the level of feature analysis, most of the descriptors and extraction methodologies being used to analyze com-mercial western music are not appropriate, or at least they have to be developed much further. Even at the level of acoustics there are very interesting and important d i f f er-ences between western musical instruments commonly used and the instruments used in other classical traditions. This basic consideration has profound implications at all musical levels.      Both the fact that most musical audio features are interre-lated and that their musical meaning is very much context dependent wi l l  have t o be emphasi zed i n our  pr oj ect. The recent approaches in audio analysis based on joint estima-tion of audio features [7] are especially relevant to finding more perceptually meaningful music characterizations. Also the current trend towards knowledge-based and top-down signal processing [8] is very relevant in our case since many of the music features of a given music reper-toire cannot even be analyzed without using information from the cultural tradition they are part of.     Within most cultural t r a d i t i o n s, music performance is learned by imitation and music appreciation is developed implicitly from listening. One of the consequences of this is that most people, even the experts, have a very difficult time verbalizing their musical opinions, but they are able to express those opinions t h r o u g h  e x a m p l e s .  B a s e d  o n  t h i s ,  our audio description work will use informed audio refer-ences supplied by experts as our main data sources, then we will focus on extracting musically meaningful features from them and on developing similarity measures between them.  3.5 Community profiling The understanding and characterization of the musical pref-erences and behaviors of groups of people sharing a given musical culture i s  a new and complex problem with very little prior work. Theoretically, t his profiling could be  de-veloped explicitly by asking music lovers and experts of a given community, but in this project we want to focus on the implicit characterization of online communities, that is, characterizing groups of people that leave a trace on the Web. We would like to capture the musical behavior of a given online user group by exploiting information sources such as web search statistics, musical preferences extracted from social networks, or data inferred from demographical, geographical, and psychographical data (personality, val-ues, attitudes, and interests). The actual musical profile of a group should be expressed through the audio descriptors of the music they interact with, ontologies generated by them, and from the automatically extracted information about their cultural context and behaviors. Provided that we have access to the appropriate data, with this type of information we should be able t o characterize any music community active online.     A good starting point for this work is the current research within the field of social computing [9], concerned with the intersection of social behavior and computational systems. Especially relevant is the research on the analysis, model-ing and knowledge extraction from communities of users. The work following the ideas of emergent semantics pro-poses the analysis of online communities for the extraction of ontologies that structure the concepts and terms of a par-ticular domain [6]. Peter Mika [10] proposes a unified model of social networks and semantics where social tag-ging systems can be modeled as a tripartite graph with Ac-tors, Concepts and Instances (Actor-Concept-Instance model). By analyzing the r e l a t i o n s  b e t we e n  c o n c e p t s  b o t h  on the basis of co-occurrence in instances and common us-age by actors (users), lightweight ontologies can emerge from online communities. A completely different approach to community knowledge extraction for the design of on-tologies is proposed in [11], where a Web portal with col-laborative ontology management capabilities is imple-mented. However, the field is very young and there is still a conceptual gap between this vision and its possible imple-mentation; only very simple ontologies can emerge.     A computational approach to community profiling re-quires having access to data from relevant online communi-ties. In our project we are starting with Freesound, an open collaborative sound database developed by our research group w h e r e  p e o p l e  with d i f f e r e n t  i n t e r e s t s  s h a r e  a u d i o  clips. Given its characteristics and our involvement in its development, it offers a good platform to carry out studies on social networking, specifically on community profiling, and to explore technological solutions to promote specific musical activities, which is also an important aspect of our project. There is a lot to be done in understanding the gen-eral issues of profiling of online communities. Only after we get a handle on the basic issues will we be able to face the specific profiling problems of the music communities of relevance to the CompMusic project. At this time we have \n155Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\n   not yet identified online communities that would be appro-priate for our research objectives, but given the fast growth of online communities we should be able to find relevant music sites to study our culture-specific issues. 3.6 System integration Quite a number of musical applications could take advan-tage of the expected research results of this project. We can focus on application areas such as music education, music creation, music appreciation, music recommendation, etc., or any particular application that might benefit from an in-formation processing engine able to process our world's music, respecting its culture specificity and that of the us-ers. In this project we want to exemplify the benefits of our multicultural approach to music computing by either devel-oping new music systems or by extending the functionality of existing ones‚Äîfunctionalities related to automatic music analysis, categorization, learning or discovery.      The development of a culture-driven system should be much more than the addition of a set of components; our system should be interactive and evolve with the users, with the context, and with the availability of new information. Even the concept of interface design becomes a critical is-sue when approached from a multicultural perspective. Can we have a single interface for a system to be used by differ-ent cultures? We think not. The interface has to adapt to the users‚Äô cognitive/cultural structures and has to engage them using the values and attributes of their own culture. All these aspects require specific research before even consid-ering any system development.     Within CompMusic there is no particular aim of develop-ing complete systems, but we want to put together proto-types with which to demonstrate our research results. How-ever since this task will be worked on during the last part of this project, at this stage it does not make much sense to continue to describe the details or even the type of system that will be developed. 4. CONCLUSIONS CompMusic is a big and ambitious project that aims at hav-ing an impact not just within the Music Computing field but also, more generally, on the overall field o f  i n formation technology. With funding from the European Research Council we will b e a b l e  t o  s u p p o r t  the research work of quite a number of PhDs and post-doctorates from different parts of the world covering all areas described in this arti-cle. In addition, we also aim to bring in a disruptive point of view in IT by promoting, and showing the validity o f ,  a new research approach rooted in a multicultural perspec-tive.  5.

In this paper, we\nstudy its contemporary practice in sung performances of Car-\nnatic and Hindustani music following an empiric and quanti-\ntative approach. To do so, we select stable fundamental fre-\nquencies, estimated via a standard algorithm, and construct\ninterval histograms from a pool of recordings. We then com-\npare such histograms against the ones obtained for differ-\nent music sources and against the theoretical values derived\nfrom 12-note just intonation and equal temperament. Our\nresults evidence that the tunings in Carnatic and Hindustani\nmusic differ, the former tending to a just intonation system\nand the latter having much equal-tempered inÔ¨Çuences. Car-\nnatic music also presents signs of a more continuous dis-\ntribution of pitches. Further subdivisions of the octave are\npartially investigated, Ô¨Ånding no strong evidence of them.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nPitch relationships are at the heart of composition and im-\nprovisation in the large majority of musical cultures [1]. The\ntuning system plays an important role in these relationships,\ndeeply inÔ¨Çuencing many musical qualities such as mood,\nconsonance or timbre [11, 17]. Traditionally, tuning has\nbeen a relevant subject of study from musicological, his-\ntorical and theoretical perspectives (see [11] and references\ntherein). Current technologies allow for a more empiric and\nquantitative analysis of the different tunings that enrich our\nmusical experience, specially those used by non-Western\ncultures or the ones which substantially differ from equal\ntemperament [6, 13, 17, 19].\nIn Indian classical music, both in Carnatic (South) and\nHindustani (North) musical traditions, musicologists have\ncomprehensively covered the issue of tuning (e.g. [15, 18]).\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Typically, one Ô¨Ånds seven notes, called swaras, which are\ndenoted by Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Da and Ni1. Except for\nthe tonic and the Ô¨Åfth, all the other swaras have two varia-\ntions each, which account for 12 notes in an octave, called\nswarasthanas. It is a well accepted notion that a swarasthana\nis aregion rather than a point [18]. Therefore, in Indian mu-\nsicology, a Ô¨Åxed tuning for each note is not as important as\nit is, say, in Western classical music. Ornamentations are\nessential, and part of the style.\nStill, instruments are tuned using some method. For ex-\nample, Shankar [18] Ô¨Årst presents a set of 12 notes tuned\nin 5-limit just intonation [11] and later discusses the the-\nory of the 22 shrutis2, which Ô¨Åxes 22 unequal subdivisions\nof the octave. Sambamoorthy [15] directly advocates for\nthis theory and states that ‚Äúthe number 22 represents the\nbarest minimum of shrutis that has been actually used in\nIndian music from ancient times‚Äù, mentioning theories of\n24, 27, 32, 48, 53 and 96 shrutis (see also [4] for a brief\noverview). Such further subdivisions of the octave are very\ndebatable [8, 9, 14], even from a purely psychoacoustical\nperspective [1]. Therefore, today, the theory of 22 shrutis\nis under controversy, with some musicologists claiming that\nthey are no more used, replaced by the basic set of 12 notes\n[14]. The tuning of these 12 notes is also debated, with au-\nthors claiming it to be either just intonation, equal-tempered\nor a mixture of both [9, 16].\nSignal processing techniques and computational resources\ncan shed light to the above discussion, providing empiric\nand quantitative evidence. Initial experiments along this line\nreported a high variability in the intonation of notes, both\nin Carnatic and Hindustani music (see [7‚Äì9] and references\ntherein). In [7, 8], Krishnaswamy employed different pitch\ntracking methods (based on the Fourier transform, the auto-\ncorrelation function and source separation) to analyze sev-\neral Carnatic music pieces with different instruments each\nand found only 12 distinctive intervals. Still, he did not\nprovide any clear statement whether these intervals corre-\nsponded to equal temperament or just intonation. Mahendra\net al. [12] used an autocorrelation-based method for pitch es-\n1They are analogous to European solf `ege‚Äôs Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si.\n2Literally, ‚Äúthat which is heard‚Äù.

How-\never, their analysis was done with very few recordings and\nwithout providing much detail of them. Larger collections\nwere analyzed by Datta et al. [2‚Äì4], who employed a phase-\nspace analysis and a series of post-processing methods to\nstudy the shrutis in Hindustani music. Among other results,\nthey report a slightly better Ô¨Åt for 12 interval scales com-\npared to 22 shruti scales in [2]. However, no substantial\ndifferences were found between the considered scales (in-\ncluding the 12-interval equal-tempered one). In subsequent\npapers [3, 4], the same authors provided evidence for the\nexistence of 22 shrutis, although they reported some contra-\ndictions.\nIn this paper we study the tuning of several Indian music\nrecordings. In order to do so, it makes sense to focus on\nthe singing voice, since it is not constrained in its pitch con-\ntrol, it is the reference to be followed by all the other instru-\nments and it has many solo sections, easy to analyze, in all\nperformances [15]. Using standard techniques, we estimate\nthe fundamental frequencies of sung recordings and, based\non a pool of these, build an interval histogram. Interval his-\ntograms for different data sources are then used to assess the\nplausibility of just intonation and equal temperament tun-\nings, both in Carnatic and Hindustani music. We compare\nthe interval histograms obtained from these sources against\nthe ones obtained from both synthetic and real signals, the\nlatter coming from commercial Western music recordings.\nThe possibility of 22 shrutis and the issue of tuning variabil-\nity in Indian classical music are also discussed.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we\npresent our methodology, both for estimating fundamental\nfrequencies and for computing interval histograms (Sec. 2).\nNext, we present and discuss our results for different sets of\nrecordings (Sec. 3). Finally, we draw our main conclusions\nand highlight future research lines (Sec. 4).\n2. METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Fundamental frequency estimation\nStrictly speaking, most Indian classical music should be con-\nsidered heterophonic. However, for the current analysis,\nwe carefully selected passages where the singer‚Äôs voice was\nvery predominant and substantially louder than the rest of\nthe usual accompaniment (Sec. 3.2). Therefore, the ana-\nlyzed recordings can be roughly considered as monophonic.\nUnder this situation, we choose to estimate their fundamen-\ntal frequency with an implementation of De Cheveign ¬¥e &\nKawahara‚Äôs YIN algorithm [5].\nFirst, we resample the audio to 44100 Hz, downmix it\nto mono and apply a low-pass Ô¨Ålter with a cutoff frequency\nof 1200 Hz. Next, we estimate the fundamental frequency\nin a moving window of 4096 samples with a hop size of\n133 (93 and 3 ms, respectively). To do so, the time lagœÑminthat yields a minimum of the modiÔ¨Åed autocorrelation\nfunctiond/prime\nn(œÑ)for each window nis selected [5]. Such\nminimumd/prime\nn(œÑmin)corresponds to a value between 0 and\n1, and provides a conÔ¨Ådence value cn= 1‚àíd/prime\nn(œÑmin)for\nthe fundamental frequency. We set the threshold for the\nsearch of such minimum to d/prime\nTh= 0.15and discard lags be-\nlow 40 or above 882 samples (above 1100 and below 50\nHz, respectively). For a further reÔ¨Ånement of the funda-\nmental frequency, a three-point parabola interpolation and a\n‚Äúbest local estimate‚Äù within 20 ms is employed [5]. Finally,\neach fundamental frequency for each window is converted\nto cents, yielding what we call a pitch contour . ConÔ¨Ådence\nvaluescnare also kept.\nSince we focus on tuning, and in order to mitigate poten-\ntial errors of YIN, we consider only ‚Äòstable‚Äô regions of our\npitch contour. Indeed, we do not need a complete transcrip-\ntion of the sung content, but only those parts of the contour\nwhere the tuning can be assumed to be more or less constant.\nTherefore, and following the ideas of Tidhar et al. [19], we\ncan apply some principle of ‚Äúconservative transcription‚Äù. In\nour case, we only do a kind of ‚Äústeady state detection‚Äù [2]\nand keep the cent and conÔ¨Ådence values of the windows cen-\ntered at a stable region of 400 ms (we consider a region to be\nstable if the standard deviation of the pitch contour elements\nof such region is lower than 20 cents).\n2.2 Interval histogram computation\nFor each recording, a weighted histogram with a resolu-\ntion of one cent is built by rounding the stable cent values\nabove. ConÔ¨Ådence values cnare used as weights. The value\nof the lowest/highest bin of the histogram corresponds to\nthe minimum/maximum value found in the stable regions\n(minus/plus an arbitrary constant /greatermuch1). This weighted his-\ntogram is mean-smoothed by taking into account the 12 near-\nest magnitudes of each bin (the 6 immediately lower and up-\nper ones) and linearly normalized between 0 and 1. Notice\nthat, in contrast to Moelants et al. [13], we have not applied\nany octave equivalence at preliminary stages. Therefore, we\nare able to discriminate intervals larger than 600 cents.\nIn Indian classical music, the reference tuning frequency\nsubstantially varies within performers [2, 15]. An intuitive,\nnatural and straightforward way to avoid the (usually not\ntrivial, see e.g. [2]) estimation of this reference frequency is\nto employ intervals, a basic perceptual concept [1]. There-\nfore, we opt to build and study an interval histogram , which\nwe denote as h. To calculate h, we select prominent peaks\nof the mean-smoothed weighted histogram and compute all\nthe possible positive subtractions between peak bins (i.e. the\nintervals). A peak bin is deÔ¨Åned such that it has a magnitude\nhigher than the mean of all the histogram‚Äôs magnitudes and\nhigher than the ones of the nearest 50 bins (the 25 lower and\nupper ones). Since in preliminary analysis we found clear\noctave equivalences for all intervals, we mapped them to\n15812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nvalues between 0 and 1199 cents. For a better visualization,\nthe interval histogram is mean-smoothed by taking into ac-\ncount the 6 nearest values of each bin (the 3 lower and upper\nbin magnitudes) and linearly normalized between 0 and 1.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Synthetic data\nTo conÔ¨Årm the usefulness of our approach to detect tunings,\nwe Ô¨Årst test it with synthetic data. To generate this data\nwe synthesize MIDI scores using a physically-modeled pi-\nano sound on Pianoteq3. We use the Ô¨Årst 5 preludes and\nfugues of Bach‚Äôs Well-Tempered Clavier and record them\nusing equal temperament and 5-limit just intonation (treat-\ning each MIDI channel as a different piece).\nThe interval histograms obtained for the synthetic sig-\nnals show clear peaks at the theoretical interval positions of\nequal temperament ( hE) and just intonation ( hJ) tuning sys-\ntems (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively). These and subsequent\nÔ¨Ågures show the positions of the theoretical interval values\nthat would be obtained with equal temperament, just intona-\ntion and the 22 shrutis (vertical lines; see Fig. 1‚Äôs caption).\nThe theoretical intervals obtained with just intonation over-\nlap with the ones obtained with the 22 shrutis (c.f. [16,18]).\nHowever, there are a few idiosyncratic locations where the\nshruti intervals do not overlap with the just intonation ones:\nat 21, 133, 337, 365, 835, 1067 and 1178 cents.\n3.2 Carnatic and Hindustani intervals\nWe now analyze and comment the interval histograms ob-\ntained with Indian classical music. We employ two mu-\nsic collections composed of Carnatic (233) and Hindustani\n(133) recordings of 30 sec to 4 min duration. The record-\nings are of both male and female singers of various schools\nand singing styles (rachanas: geetams, varnas, keertanas and\nkruti). They comprise artists with an active period from\n1930 to present such as Balamurali Krishna, Sudha Raghu-\nnathan, Maharajampuram Santhanam, John Higgins, V oleti\nVenkateswarlu, Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty, Amir Khan, Bhim-\nsen Joshi, Vidyadhar Vyas or Girija Devi. All recordings\nwere selected such that the voice was very loud compared\nto the rest (primarily alap parts from khyal compositions).\nV oice was normally accompanied by the drone of a tambura\nand/or a sarangi, the percussion of a mridangam or the tabla\nand a violin4. In the case of Hindustani music we discarded\nrecordings that contained a harmonium since this could be\ntuned to equal-temperament.\nThe interval histogram hCobtained for Carnatic music\nsuggests that statements about the use of a just intonation\n3http://www.pianoteq.com\n4A comprehensive summary of Indian instruments can be found\nathttp://chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/\ninstruments.htmlLocation Nearest JI Diff.

In general, prominent peaks\nare closer to the theoretical interval positions of a just into-\nnation tuning (Table 1). In particular, clear peaks were iden-\ntiÔ¨Åed at 314, 427, 496, 703, 813, 906, 923 and 996 cents.\nThe correlation between the Carnatic ( hC) and the just into-\nnation ( hJ) histograms yielded a value of r(hC,hJ) = 0.552,\nwhereas the correlation between hCand the equal-tempered\ninterval histogram hEyieldedr(hC,hE) = 0.448. The dif-\nference between correlations r(hC,hJ)andr(hC,hE)was\nfound to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at p< 10‚àí4, according\nto Lawley‚Äôs equicorrelation test [10].\nThe interval histogram hHobtained for Hindustani mu-\nsic, however, shows a clear tendency towards equal tem-\nperament (Fig. 4). Except for few values distributed near\ntheoretical just intonation intervals (e.g. 92, 223, 792 and\n884), the major part of the prominent peaks lie near theoret-\nical equal-tempered intervals (e.g. 300, 400, 800 and 900).\nProminent peaks for hHwere found at 96, 202, 222, 299,\n279, 395, 499, 597, 702, 794, 803, 897, 906, 1000, 1104 and\n1108. All of them have an equal-tempered location as the\nnearest one except 222, 279, 702, 906 and 1108, which have\na just intonation location as the nearest one. The correlation\nbetween hHandhEyielded a value of r(hH,hE) = 0.723,\nwhereas the correlation against hJwasr(hH,hJ) = 0.641.\nThe difference between r(hH,hE)andr(hH,hJ)was found\nto be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at p<10‚àí4.\n159Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 120000.20.40.60.81\nInterval [cents]Relative frequencyFigure 1 .

Interval histogram for Hindustani music ( hH; bold line).\nThis tendency towards equal temperament may be ex-\nplained by the introduction of new instruments in Hindus-\ntani music in the last centuries. Hindustani music, unlike\nCarnatic, was more open to new inÔ¨Çuences, as the devo-\ntional aspect lost its importance. Most instruments used\nin Indian music have Ô¨Çexible tuning capabilities [15]. One\nmajor exception is the hand-pumped harmonium, a mostly\nequal-tempered instrument introduced in Hindustani music\nin the late 19th century which is used extensively to accom-pany the singer soloist. Therefore, it is logical to think that\nsuch introduction has inÔ¨Çuenced the way the singers adjust\ntheir pitch. Such inÔ¨Çuence has yielded, according to some\nmusicians, a ‚Äúhybrid tuning system‚Äù [9], where most singers\ntry to maintain the Ô¨Çat third, but only the purist ones try to\nalso maintain the Ô¨Çat second and the Ô¨Çat sixth.\nGoing back to the interval histogram of Carnatic music\n(hC; Fig. 3), we see that distributions around the theoreti-\ncal interval locations are less peaky than the ones obtained\n16012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 120000.20.40.60.81\nInterval [cents]Relative frequencyFigure 5 .

Interval histogram for the vocal Motown tracks ( hM; bold line).\nwith other sources (see below). They are Ô¨Çatter, showing\nless preference for speciÔ¨Åc locations, and extending up to\nthe bounds of the just intonation ones. This partially sup-\nports the idea of swarasthana regions (Sec. 1). On the other\nhand, in the analyzed Hindustani music, we see consider-\nably peaky distributions in hH(Fig. 4), which contrasts with\nthe Ô¨Çatter distributions of hC. This suggests that in our Hin-\ndustani recordings the distribution of pitches is much less\ncontinuous than in the Carnatic ones.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 1, the actual use of the 22 shruti\nscale is controversial. In the light of the results presented\nhere, we must conclude that there is no strong evidence for\nthe existence of this scale in our recordings. For the Hin-\ndustani recordings, no peaks are observed at the idiosyn-\ncratic locations we mentioned in Sec. 3.1. Thus we cannot\ndifferentiate the intervals generated by the 22 shrutis from\nthe ones generated by 12 note just intonation. As for the\nCarnatic recordings, we note that there is not much support\nfor these idiosyncratic locations. If we look at, for exam-\nple, 133, 835 or 1067 cents, we do not see any contribution\ntohC. However, small contributions seem to be made at\n337, 365 and 1178 cents. Overall, claims that the 22 shrutis\nare perceivable but not actually played (e.g. [7‚Äì9]) acquire\nstrength. However, this phenomenon needs to be further\nstudied, also with behavioral and perceptual studies.\n3.3 Comparison with Western practice\nTo conclude, we apply our methodology to a number of\nselected Western recordings. In particular, we select 121\ntracks of electric (fretted) bass extracted from a collection of\nmultitrack recordings of popular music pieces and 142 vocaltracks extracted from a collection of multitrack Motown re-\ncordings. These recordings comprise different commercial\nartists whose active period was between 1960 and 2000. All\ntracks were monophonic and without any sound effect that\ncould change their tuning.\nThe interval histogram of the electric bass recordings hB\nshows no surprises (Fig. 5). All prominent peaks are very\nclose to (if not exactly at) the theoretical locations of equal\ntemperament intervals. We can appreciate the peakiness of\nthe distributions around, for example, 100, 200, 300, 400\nor 500 cents. We Ô¨Ånd correlations r(hB,hE) = 0.831and\nr(hB,hJ) = 0.478, which have a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant dif-\nference atp<10‚àí4.\nThe interval histogram of the vocal Motown recordings\nhMpresents some subtleties worth commenting (Fig. 6). In-\ntuitively, since singers perform on top of an existing equal-\ntempered background mix, one would expect hMto have\nprominent peaks at the theoretical locations of equal tem-\nperament intervals, in the same vein as hB. Although this is\ntrue for many peaks (e.g. at 200, 300, 700 or 1000 cents), we\ncan also see some other peaks closer to just intonation po-\nsitions (e.g. at 92, 112, 406, 792 or 874 cents). Indeed, the\ncorrelations r(hM,hE)andr(hM,hJ)are very similar (0.463\nand 0.477, respectively), with a difference that is only just\nstatistically signiÔ¨Åcant ( p‚âà0.01). The issue of whether\nthere exist some traces of just intonation intervals in these\nrecordings is left for further investigation.\nThe fact that even Western Motown recordings better ap-\nproach the just intonation locations than Hindustani mu-\nsic reinforces our hypothesis that the latter has dramatically\nsuffered from equal-tempered inÔ¨Çuences. In addition, we\n161Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\nshould notice that the peakiness of hHseems to be slightly\nlarger than the one of hM, which indicates that the notion of\nswarasthana regions may have been lost too.\n4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThe results in Sec. 3 shed light on some of the existing con-\ntroversies in the tuning of sung Indian classical music. First,\nwe demonstrate how a simplistic approach using standard\ntechniques allows us to assess, in an empiric and quanti-\ntative manner, the usage of different tuning systems. Sec-\nond, we provide evidence that Carnatic music does not make\nuse of an equal-tempered tuning, showing that it presents a\nstrong correlation with 5-limit just intonation. Furthermore,\nour Ô¨Åndings support the notion that Carnatic music may be\nless conÔ¨Åned to strict intervals than the other recordings we\nhave analyzed (swarasthana regions). Hindustani music, on\nthe other hand, seems to be explained by a mixture of equal-\ntempered tuning and 5-limit just intonation. In addition, we\nÔ¨Ånd prominent peaks in its interval histogram, showing a\npreference for stricter, more precise intervals. In the view of\nour analysis, the theory of the 22 shrutis lacks strong quan-\ntitative evidence. However, we cannot rule out this theory,\nsince many of the intervals overlap with the just intonation\nones.\nAs future work, to resolve this ambiguity, we could em-\nploy a method for the estimation of reference tunings [2, 6].\nIn addition, more recordings should be gathered and differ-\nent categorizations than Carnatic and Hindustani should be\nstudied (e.g. different epochs [13], different ragas [3] and\ndifferent schools [2]). Furthermore, the fundamental fre-\nquency estimation procedure could be reÔ¨Åned [7,19], as well\nas the histograms‚Äô construction [6]. Unsupervised clustering\ntechniques could be also introduced [3, 4]. Finally, a relax-\nation and the effect of our ‚Äòstability conditions‚Äô should be\nevaluated in depth.\n5.

INTRODUCTION  \nDevising different strategies for generating rhythm in real \ntime is one of the goals of the project ‚ÄúKinetic controlle r \ndriven adaptive music composition systems‚Äù . After propo s-\ning the use of Genetic Algorithms  [1], and proposing a \nmethod for generate a metrical rhythm performance st o-\nchastically  [2], we now propose a simple yet effective \nmethod for recombining MIDI drum loops of a ce rtain style \n(such as those available in Apple‚Äôs GarageBand).  We d e-\nveloped a measure of rhythmic complexity in order to sort \nthe loops prior to utilizing them in the recombination pr o-\ncess.  In this Max/MSP [3] application, the user can reco m-\nbine in real time, with different degrees of complexity, a \nbatch of MIDI drum loops in order to get non -excessively \nrepetitive combinations of loops during a performance. The \nuser can control the amount of variation in recombination \nduring performance, as well as different degrees of co m-\nplexity.   \n2. THE ALGORITHM  \nRecombinance is an effective technique to generate music \naccording to a certain style [4]. The kin.recombinator appl i-\ncation generates rhythmic patterns by recombining existing ones. The recombination process consists of playing back \nMIDI drum loop files by selecting portions of these files at \nregular intervals. An analysis of the files is perf ormed prior \nto the recombination, in order to sort them according to \ntheir complexity and, in this way, better control the resul t-\ning rhythms.     \nThe algorithm can be divided in two phases. In the first \nphase a set of MIDI drum loop files input by the user  are \nanalyzed and sorted according to how complex they are, \nfrom the simple st to the most complex. This complexity \nmeasure  is based on a new method for measuring syncop a-\ntion, by comparing the patterns against a template chara c-\nteristic of  their meter . \nIn th e second phase, the patterns are played back and r e-\ncombined. A new pattern is selected for playback  on every \nbeat. Playback is performed in a cyclic way;  it restarts  when \nreaching the end of the file. When a new a file is s elected, \nplayback always continue s at the beat from where it was left \nin the previous file , always preserving the me trical position . \nThe user controls the complexity of the r esulted rhythm and \nthe amount of variation by d etermining which patterns get \nselected for playback in an easy and i ntuitive way based on \ntheir order of complex ity. \n2.1 Calculation of the complexity scores and sorting of \nMIDI drum loops  \nVarious  approaches  for measuring complexity  in rhythmic \npatterns  exist , such as pattern matching  techniques  [5], \nrhythmic  syncopation measures  [6] and analysis of  the \nmathematical or geometrical properties of the patterns  \n[6][7]. Here, we define  a new one, which is based on  the \nsame principle as  G. Toussaint‚Äôs  metric complexity  [6], \nwhich  is a comparison of a rhythmic  pattern against a  tem-\nplate chara cteristic of  its meter.  Unlike Toussaint‚Äôs a p-\nproach that uses the template as a way of calculating the \nmetrical accents, we use the template as the fundamental \ntool for analyzing and defining relationships between the \nevents comprising the pattern. Moreover, unlike most met h-\nods for measuring complexity, which use a binary represe n-\ntation of the pa tterns and ignore the amplitudes of the \nevents that comprise the pattern, we take into account the \nrelative amplitudes of the events in our calculation .  \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that co p-\nies bear this notice and the f ull citation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011  International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n381Poster Session 3\n  \n \n The user provides rhythmic patterns in the form of a co l-\nlection of MIDI files. The MIDI files are read and are qua n-\ntized according to a fixed quantization grid. This way each \nmeasure in a pattern is subdivided into pulses according to \nthe time signature and the quantization grid.  The quantiz a-\ntion grid value we use is the 32nd note. Deviations from that \ngrid are co nsidered to be  micro -timing deviations  and they \nare not treated in the current analysis.  An amplitud e value  is \nassigned to each pulse , according  to the MIDI v elocities \nfound at that time p osition  after the quantization .  \nA metrical template that defines metrical hierarchy is \nconstructed by stratifying the m eter found in the MIDI file s. \nThis template co nsists of the metrical  levels which comprise \nthe meter. A ‚Äúmetrical accent‚Äù  value is calculated and a s-\nsigned to each pulse according to the metrical level it b e-\nlongs to . Each rhythmic pattern  found in the MIDI files is \ncompared  against  the metrical template  yielding a  separate \nscore for each pulse  in the pattern . The result is further fi l-\ntered by  the aforementioned values of the metrical accents . \nThe calculated  scores can be thought of as a measure of \nhow much each pulse contradicts the metrical stru cture d e-\nscribed by the template and, in this sense,  how much each \npulse contributes to the syncopation of the pattern. Finally, \na complexity score is assigne d to each MIDI file taking into \naccount , in addition to the syncopation , the density of MIDI \nevents in each file.  \n2.1.1 Constructing  rhythmic patterns  from MIDI files  \nThe user provides the MIDI drum loops as a set of MIDI \nfiles with the same bar -length and time signature. The MIDI \nnote-on events are extracted from each file  and their posi-tions are  quantized to  a 32nd note grid. The lists of ampl i-\ntudes for each pulse in the meter (i.e., their velocity value) \nmake the rhythmic patterns to be constructed. It is common \nin MIDI drum loops that each different MIDI note number \ncorrespond s to a di fferent timbre, e.g. one not e number for \na kick drum sound and another for a hit cymbal . We con-\nstruct a different rhythmic pattern for each MIDI note num-\nber according to the MIDI  velocity and time position of any \nnote-on events corresponding to that note number . The f inal \ncomplexity score calculated for the MIDI file is obtained  by \naveraging the scores of each rhythmic pattern co nstructed \nfrom the file. \nTwo more ways of translating MIDI note -on events into \nrhythmic patterns are provided: one for single -timbre MIDI \ninstruments, where a ll notes correspond to the same timbre  \nwith different pi tch, and one for a general MIDI drum l i-\nbrary. For single -timbre instruments, MIDI note nu mbers \nare ignored and a single rhythmic pattern is co nstructed by \ntaking the maximum MIDI v elocity in each puls e. For the \nGeneral MIDI drum library case,  different groups of MIDI \nnote numbers  correspond to  different patterns , e.g. all hi -hat \nnotes are grouped together to construct one rhythmic pa t-\ntern while other notes like bells are treated each one sepa-\nrately.  \n2.1.2 Constructing  the metrical te mplate  \nA metrical structure as the one described by F. Le rdahl and \nR. Jackendoff [8] can be constructed for each  meter found \nin the MIDI files. It must be noted that in order for the me t-\nrical structu re to be meaningful ly in relation to the rhythmic \npattern s extracted from a MIDI file, we must a ssume that \nthe meter of the template is in fact the meter of the pattern s; \nthat is, the time sign atures found in the MIDI files are the \nactual time signatures o f the drum loops co ntained in the \nfiles.  \nThe meter is stratified  into metrical  levels in a hiera r-\nchical manner so that each pulse belongs to a specific me t-\nrical level and all lower ones. In order to stratify the meter \nthe nu mber of pulses is decomposed into prime factors  (see \nFigure  1). Each prime factor describes how each stratific a-\ntion level is subdivided.  Different permutations of the prime \nfactors describe different metrical hierarchies . The stratif i-\ncation process is described in detail  in [9]. A simplified ve r-\nsion can also be  found in [6]. A metrical accent value is a s-\nsigned to each pulse based on the stratification level  i it be-\nlongs to, following an exponential equ ation: \ni\niM 5.0ÔÄΩ\n   (1) \nSince the number of pulses in a certain meter is dete r-\nmined by the quantization grid , the lowest stratification le v-\nel will always correspond to  that grid.  For the sake  of sim-\n \nFigure  1. Stratification of a 3/4 meter to the 16th note le vel. \nEach pulse belongs to a stratification level and all lower \nones.  \n38212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nplicity , in the examples presented  here we omitte d the 32nd \nnote metrical level.  \n2.1.3 Comparing the rhythmic  patterns to the te mplate  \nThe comparison of a rhythmic pattern to a metric al template \nis essentially  a process of spotting  the pulses in the rhythmic \npattern that contradict the prevailing meter d escribed by the \ntemplate.  In that sense, these pulses are mainly responsible \nfor any syncopation  present in the rhythmic pattern  and t he \nresult of the comparison is a mea sure of that syncopation . \nEliminating the events that occur regularly on the beat in \nsome metrical level helps distinguishing the sy ncopating \npulses.  Events  that occur regularly  on the beat do not gene r-\nate syncopation. The remaining events would be isolated \nones, that mostly occur in low metrical lev els, i.e. in ‚Äúoff -\nbeat‚Äù positions , and that contribute s to the complex ity more \nactively . For example, a cymbal hit on every quarter note \nbeat with more or less the same amplit ude contri butes less \nthan a snare  that happens only at sp ecific off -beat posi tions  \nand contributes more to a more complex  rhythm .  \nIn order to define how each pulse  contribut es to a steady \nbeat, its relation to the rest of the pulses must be exa mined.  \nWe examine the relations between the pulses of the pattern \nin light  of the metrical template, taking  advantage of its  hi-\nerarchical char acter.  Each metrical level is examined sep a-\nrately, so that each pulse in a pattern is assigned a separate \nscore for each met rical level it b elongs to. A low score in a \nmetrical level signifies that the pulse co ntributes to a steady \nbeat in that level and therefore does not contradict the m e-\nter, e.g. a quarter note surrounded by equally loud quarter \nnotes has a low score in the q uarter note metrical level, \nwhile a loud quarter note with no neighbors will have a \nhigher score. After examining all metrical levels , the min i-\nmum score for each pulse is kept.  \nThe score is calcu lated as the  average  difference of  the \nampli tude of the pulse under consideration from the ampl i-\ntudes of the neighbor pulses in each metrical level. In the \nexample of Figure 2, pulse number 5 gets three  scores, one \nfor each metric al level it belongs to, namely that of the \nquarter note  (1), the eighth  note (2) and the 16th note (3). \nEach score is the average of  the two  differences of ampl i-tudes between pulse 5 and i) pulses 1 and 9 for metrical \nlevel 1 , ii) pulses  3 and 7 for level 2 and, finally, iii) pulses \n4 and 6 for level 3. On the other hand, pulse 10 gets only \none score (metrical level 3) arising from the two differences \nfrom pulses 8 and 11.  Negative differences  are always  set \nequal to zero.  \nOne important feature of the metrical structure of the \ntemplate  is the alternation of metrical levels, in other words , \nthe highest metrical level of a pulse  is always di fferent from \nthe one s of its immediate neighbors.  As a consequence, \npulses in low metrical levels are always surrounded by \npulses in higher levels  and in most cases  their neighbors al-\nso belong  to different metrical levels  (see pulse 10 in Figure \n2). An isolated event in such a pulse pro duces a strong  syn-\ncopation feel . This syncopation  is stronger  when the diffe r-\nence of the metrical level s of the pulse s is larger . Compare, \nfor example, any of the pulses 4, 6, 8 or 10 to pulses 2 or \n12. In the absence of an event in pulse 1, pulses 2 and 12 \ncreate a stronger contradiction to the meter b ecause pulse 1 \nbelongs to the highest metrical level  (see Figure 3, A and \nB). Having this in mind, we introduced a weighting  factor in \nthe amplitude differences calculated above.  This factor is \nproportional to  the difference of the highest me trical level \nof the two pulses  that the amplitudes are taken from . This \nway the amplitude difference between pulse 2 and 1 has \nmore weight than the one between 6 and 5. Similarly, the \namplitude difference between pulse 5 and 1 has more \nweight than that between 5 and 9.  \nAn important aspect of rhythmic patterns is the direction \nin which  they are always performed. Time in music, as in \neverything else, flows in only one direction. Pulses succeed \none another in a specific order. The relation of a pulse to its \nprevious pulse is not equivalent to that to the following \npulse. Two equally loud events one after another create the \nimpression of an accent on the second event rather than on \nthe first. Let us return to our example template of Figure 2. \n \nFigure 2. Pulse number 5 belongs to metrical levels 1, 2 \nand 3. Pulse 10 belongs only to level 3.  \n \nFigure 3. Left: The contradiction of the rhythmic p attern to \nthe meter is greater in pattern B than in A since pulse 1 b e-\nlongs to a higher metrical level than pulse 5.  Right:  A loud \nevent before an a ccent (C ) enforces the accent while  a loud \nevent after an accent (D ) weakens the accent.  \n383Poster Session 3\n  \n \nConsider the relation between pulse 7 and pulses 5 or  9. A \nloud event on pulse 7 affects differently a loud event on \npulse 5 from one on pulse 10 (see  Figure 3, C and D ). In \norder to take into account this fact in our evaluat ion of how \nmuch an event contradicts the meter, the weights discussed \nin the amplitude differences calculations need to be mod i-\nfied, so that a smaller weight is to be given to the amplitude \ndiffe rence with the previous pulse than with the following \none. \nThe various pulses in a rhythmic pattern have  a diffe rent \npotential  in contradicting the prevailing meter , or syncopa t-\ning, depending on whi ch metrical levels they belong to. \nThis syncopation  potential can be thought of as the o pposite \nof the metrical accent , which essentially is the pote ntial of a \npulse to contribute to a steady beat.  A loud ev ent in a pulse \nthat belongs to a high metrical level  (high met rical a ccent),  \ndoes not have a lot of  ‚Äúchance ‚Äù of contradicting the meter, \neven if it is isolated without any events in its v icinity . The \nscores calculated above represent how much a pulse contr a-\ndicts the meter with respect to its relation to its neighbors  \nbut do not take into account this syncopation p otential.  We \ntherefore  multiply the scores previously calc ulated by a fac-\ntor proportional to the inverse of the metrical accent of \nequation (1). This way a pulse that belongs to metrical level \n0 could never contradict the meter, irrel evant of if an event \nexists in this or any other pulse s of the meter. Of course,  the \nabsence of an event in a high level pulse creates the poss i-\nbility for an event in some other pulse, prob ably of a low \nmetrical level, to produce  a strong syncopation , but this is \nreflected on the syncopation  potential of the low metrical \nlevel pulse.  \nThe last step taken in the calculation of our syncopation \nmeasure is to sum the scores of all pulses in the pattern and \nnormalize the result.  Normalization is performed by divi d-\ning the result by the maximum possible  sum for the meter \nand bar -length. This maximum is calculat ed by co mparing  \nagainst the metrical templ ate a pattern  in which  all pulses of \nthe lowest metrical level have maximum ampl itudes and all \nother pulse s have zero amplitude . \nAs it was described in the previous paragraphs , the \nweights used in the amplitude dif ferences are calculated a c-\ncording to the metrical levels of the pulses and to whether \nthe difference is taken from the previous or the following  \npulse. We set the exact weights empirically, by experimen t-\ning with various combinations. For differences betwee n \npulses of the same metrical level the weight was set to be \nhalf of that between pulses which belong to the two extreme \nmetrical levels. The difference from the prev ious pulse was \nset to the 80% of the weight of that from the next pulse.  2.1.4 Examples of  measu ring syncopation  \nIn this section an illustrative example of the method for \nmeasuring syncopation is given. A short evaluation of the \nmethod follows, by measuring the syncopation of six clave \nand bell rhythms of the African, Brazilian and Cuban music.  \nA sim ilar comparison of other syncopation and complexity \nmeasures based on these pa tterns can be found in [6]. \nThe two patterns  of Figure 4 are com pared against  the \nsame metrical template, namely that of a 3/4 meter. The o n-\nly difference between the two patterns is  found  in pulse 9, a \npulse that belongs to a high metrical level.  In pattern A \npulse 9 is silent while in pattern B it has maximum ampl i-\ntude. Although this difference does not cause any changes \nin the score of that pulse, it affects drastically the scores of \nthe other pulses in the patterns. The two immediate neig h-\nbors, pulse 8 and 10, both have maximum amplitudes. \nWhen no event exists in pulse 9 , both pulses have  high \nscores  since no events exist in  their vicinity, with that of \npulse 8 being a little higher. In pattern B, the ampl itude of \npulse 9 causes both scores of pulses 8 and 10 to drop. This \ndrop is larger for pulse 8, so that, pulse 8 now has a smaller \nscore than pulse 10. This inversion in th e relation of the \nscores of the two pulses is the result of the ampli tude \nweights used . In the absence of an event in pulse 9, the pr e-\nvious pulse creates a stronger syncopation. In the pre sence \nof high amplitude in pulse 9, the following pulse weakens \nthe accent, while the previous one tends to enforce it.  Alt-\nhough the difference is small, it can be of importance when \nsorting drum loops  of the  same  music style  with little diffe r-\nences. \nIn the absence of an event  in pulse 9, a small contrib u-\ntion in the total syncopation of pattern A arises in pulse 5. \nPulse 5 and 9 are related through the quarter note me trical \nlevel. The contribution is small for two reasons. On one \nhand , because of the high amplitude of pulse 1 which b e-\nlongs to a higher metrical level and the refore gets a higher \nweight than pulse 9. On the other hand, pulse 5 belongs to a \npulse with a high metrical accent, so that its syncopation \n \nFigure 4. Two patterns (grey bars) compared to the same \nmetrical template (dashed squares). The black bars repr e-\nsent the score of each separate pulse. The total syncopation \nscore  is shown above each pattern.  \n38412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \npotential is  low. \nIn order to evaluate the syncopation measure described \nabove, we measured six clave and bell rhythmic patterns, \nnamely the Shiko, Son, Soukous, Rumba, Gahu and Bossa -\nNova. These patterns are all five-note patterns with 4/4 time \nsigna ture and are some of the most frequently used in the \nAfrican, Cuban and Brazilian music.  \nIn Figure 5 the six patterns are presented together with \ntheir syncopation score s. Dynamic accents were not consi d-\nered;  all pulses have eithe r maximum amplitude or are  \ncompletely  silent . The black bars represent the relative co n-\ntribution of each pulse to the total syncopation score.  The \nscores obtained by the calcul ations  seem to agree with  our \nexperience that Shiko is the easiest pattern , Rumb a is of \nmedium complexity and Gahu and Bossa -Nova are  amongst  \nthe most difficult to perform.  The order  from simple to \ncomplex is also in agreement with the cognitive complexity  \nmeasure  proposed by J. Pressing (see [5] and [6]).  \n2.1.5 Calculating the complexity of a MIDI file  \nThe complexity of a drum loop can be thought of as a ve c-\ntor in a two dimensional space, where one dimension is the \ndensity of the events and the other is th e syncopation. The \nlength of the vector is the complexity  score . The syncop a-\ntion measure is already no rmalized and can be directly used \nas one of the coordinates of the vector. The density of \nevents is calculated as the sum of all the MIDI velocities \nfound  in the MIDI file. This sum represents an effective \ndensity, since  it does not correspond to  the number of \nevents  in the pattern . This number needs to be normalized \nbefore it can be used as a c oordinate in our complexity \nplane. We normalize the density by dividing with the largest density value in the colle ction of MIDI files provided by the \nuser. The total complexity of a file is then calculated as: \n2 2n syncopatio density Complexity ÔÄ´ ÔÄΩ\n        (2) \nThis is the value used to sort the MIDI files , from the \nmost simple to th e most complex .  \n2.2 Recombining the rhythmic patterns  \nThe sorted MIDI files form  a two dimensional space, where \nthe vertical dimension represents their order of complexity \nand the horizontal represents their evolution in time (see \nFigure 6). All files share the same time signature and have \nthe same bar -length and, therefore, are perfectly aligned.  \n A global transport controls the current playback pos ition \nwhich is common to all files. The tempo of each file is i g-\nnored and the playback  follows the transport's tempo, co n-\ntrolled in real time by the user. Playback is performed in a \nloop. At every beat , a new file is randomly selected and \nplayback continues in this file at the current tr ansport's pos i-\ntion (see Figure 6), preserving always the metrical position .  \nThe d uration of the recombination beat is defined according \nto the time signature, e.g.  in a 4/4 meter , the beat would \ncorrespond to the quarter notes.  \nInstead of selecting  a file out of the whole collection  of \nthe provided MIDI files , the selection process is restricted \nto a smaller collection of files. During the pe rformance, the \nuser controls the resulted rhythm by contro lling in real time \nthe range of files, from the simplest to the most complex \nthat can be selected for playback. Increasing the range leads \nto more variation in the resulted rhythm, while moving the \nentire range vertically to more or less complex patterns co n-\ntrols the complexity of the rhythm.  \nThe out put of the recombination algorithm undoub tedly \ndepends on the provided MIDI files. In order for the output  \nto be coherent , all files should belong to the same music \nstyle. When the files have a similar structure, either a large \n \nFigure 5.

This comes about as a direct result from u s-\ning a global transport to control playback.   \n3. MAX/MSP APPLICATION  \nThe algorithm has been implemented as the \nkin.recombinator  Max/MSP a pplicat ion. A collection of \nMax/MSP externals, java classes suitable to be loaded  to \nthe mxj Max/MSP object and Max/MSP abstractions were \ndeveloped as parts of the a pplication.  \nThe user drags and drops a folder containing MIDI files \ninto the Max/MSP application . The files are automatically \nsorted and the global Max/MSP transport controls pla y-\nback. The user can graphically  control the range of files b e-\ning recombined at any one time with a range slider  like the \none in  Figure 7.  \nThe MIDI f iles are read and quantized to the 32nd note \nlevel by the java class kinMIDIFileReader .

After fi n-\nishing calculating the scores for all the files, the files are \nsorted according to their scores.  \nThe kin.Recombi neMIDIFiles  abstraction is performing \nthe playback.  It selects at every beat a new file for playback \nwhich is read by the kin.MIDIFileReader . \nThe kin.recombinator  Max/MSP application , as well as a \nMax/MSP patch for testing out the  syncopation measure can \nbe downloaded at the group‚Äô s web si te: \nhttp://smc.inescporto.pt/kinetic/  \n 4.

It gives an overview\nof the difÔ¨Åculties of working with ethnic music: i) There is\nan enormous variety of styles, timbres, moods, instruments\nfalling under ‚Äôethnic music‚Äô umbrella. ii) The absence of a\ntheoretical framework and a different attitude towards mu-\nsic imply that western music-theory concepts do not always\napply. iii) A third factor that complicates access to ethnic\n1Tarsos is open source and available on http://tarsos.0110.be .\nIt runs on any recent Java Runtime and can be started using Java Web Start.\n2With the Application Programmers Interface tasks can be automated\nby programming scripts.

Archives of ethnic music are often\nnot or not yet digitized, badly documented, and when meta-\ndata is available terminology and spelling may vary. These\nthree elements cause a lack of ground truth, which makes\n(large scale) research challenging.\nThere are difÔ¨Åculties working with ethnic music but there\nis also a lot of potential. While some archives with ethnic\nmusic are being digitized, the need for specialized MIR ap-\nplications becomes more apparent. Ethnic music offers a\nunique environment of characteristic timbres, rhythms and\ntextures which could use adapted or completely new, inno-\nvative tools. The potential of computational research within\nthe context of ethnic music has been stressed by the intro-\nduction of the term Computational Ethnomusicology [13].\nHopefully this new interdisciplinary (sub)Ô¨Åeld can give an\nimpulse to the study and dissemination of a rich heritage of\nmusic that is now hidden in archives and aid or even stimu-\nlate new musicological Ô¨Åeld work.\nThis research focuses on one of those unique collections\nof ethnic music: the audio archive of the Royal Museum for\n169Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\nCentral Africa (RMCA) in Belgium. It is one of the largest\ncollections worldwide of music from mainly Central Africa.\nFigure 1 displays the geographical distribution of the audio\ncollection3that consists of about 50,000 sound recordings\n(with a total of 3,000 hours of music), dating from the early\n20th century up to now. A selection of this data set with\nAfrican music has already been used for a study on pitch\norganization and tone scales [9].\nThis paper is structured as follows: After this introduc-\ntion sketching the background for this research the follow-\ning chapter identiÔ¨Åes the need for precise pitch analysis and\nthe rationale behind the development of Tarsos. Chapter\nthree will provide a view on the method we use, and give\na brief overview of related work. Chapter four documents\nthe structure and method of the Tarsos platform. Example\napplications of Tarsos can be found in chapter Ô¨Åve. The Ô¨Ånal\nchapter gives a conclusion and ponders on future work.\n2. SCALE ORGANISATION\nForWestern music pitch organization in music relies on a\nwell-deÔ¨Åned, historically grown music theory. Nowadays\nalmost all western music relies on a division of the octave in\n12 equal parts. Only few composers have explored different\ndivisions of the octave (e.g. Darreg, Partch).\nInnon-Western classical music , tone scale organization\nleans on an, often very different, theoretical system than the\nWestern equal temperament. The most outspoken difference\nis that not all pitch intervals have an equal size. This can\nresult in an explicitly sought musical tension. An example\nis the unequal octave division of the Indonesian gamelan\nPelog scale.\nOral music traditions however, rely almost exclusively\non musical practice. Without a written musical theory the\nmaster-student relationship becomes very important, together\nwith the societal context in which people hear music. An\noral culture does not support the development towards a pol-\nished music theory but grows more organically. These fac-\ntors deÔ¨Åne the speciÔ¨Åc characteristics of the music itself:\nless harmonic impact, instruments with varying tuning, no\nharmonic modulation and a large number of different tone\nscales. Until now, far too little attention has been paid to\nthis tone scale diversity. There is a need for a system that can\nextract pitch organisation - scales - from music in a culture-\nindependent manner.\nCurrently there is software available for pitch analysis\nbut it mainly focuses on Western music and is used for e.g.\nkey-detection in pop music. To Ô¨Åll the need for automated\npitch analysis of ethnic music Tarsos has been developed.\nTarsos creates opportunities to analyse pitch organization in\n3There is a website featuring complete descriptions and audio frag-\nments, it can be found at http://music.africamuseum.be0107 363 585 833 1083A100200300400500600\nPitch (cent )Number of annotations\nFigure 2 .

PITCH ANALYSIS\nThe basic idea behind the method we use is simple: count\nhow many times each fundamental frequency is repeated\nthroughout an audio signal and represent this data in a use-\nful way. This method has a long tradition and historically\nthis was done by hand, or, more anatomically correct, by\near. Each tone in a musical piece was compared with a large\nset of tuned bells and every match was tallied. This method\nis very labour-intensive and does not scale to large music\narchives.\nAlready in the late sixties researchers automated this pro-\ncess to study the tone scale of a Swedish folk instrument\n[11]. Since then various terms have been introduced to de-\nscribe this, or closely related ideas: Frequency Histogram\n[11], Chromavector [9], Constant-Q ProÔ¨Åle [10], Harmonic\nPitch Class ProÔ¨Åle [5] and Pitch-frequency Histogram [6].\nWorking with ethnic music, and especially African mu-\nsic, it is important that the pitch organization diversity can\nbe captured. In [9] this is done as follows. At Ô¨Årst the au-\ndio is analysed in blocks of 10ms and for each block a fun-\ndamental frequency estimation is made. Secondly, the fre-\nquencies are converted to the cents scale with C0set to zero\ncents while maintaining a list with the number of times each\nfrequency occurs. And Ô¨Ånally the listed values are reduced\nto one octave. This results in a quasi-continuous pitch class\nhistogram of 1200 values as seen in Figure 2. With Tarsos\nthis method is automated in a Ô¨Çexible way.\nPitch class histograms can be used for various applica-\ntions. The most straightforward application is tone scale\n17012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ndetection. To extract a scale from a pitch class histogram\npeak extraction is used: i.e. Ô¨Ånding the circles in Figure 2.\nWith the pitch classes identiÔ¨Åed a pitch interval matrix can\nbe constructed and subsequently used for comparison and\nanalysis.\n4. TARSOS PLATFORM\nThe main contribution of this paper is Tarsos: a platform for\npitch analysis. It makes the methods described in [6, 9] eas-\nier to use and therefore accessible to a larger audience. Es-\nsentially Tarsos tries to make one-off studies of pitch usage\neasily repeatable, veriÔ¨Åable and scalable to large data sets.\nThe functions of Tarsos will be explained using the block\ndiagram in Figure 3. This should make the information Ô¨Çow\nclear and provide a feel on how Tarsos can be used.\n4.1 Input\nAs input Tarsos accepts audio in almost any format. All au-\ndio is transcoded to a standardized format. The conversion\nis done using FFMPEG4, the default format is PCM WAV\nwith all channels are downmixed to mono.\nAnother input modality are Scala Ô¨Åles. Scala Ô¨Åles are\nstandardized text Ô¨Åles which contain tone scale information.\nThe Ô¨Åle format is deÔ¨Åned by the Scala program. Quoting\nthe Scala website: http://www.huygens-fokker.\norg/scala/\n‚ÄúScala is a powerful software tool for exper-\nimentation with musical tunings, such as just\nintonation scales and non-Western scales. It\nsupports scale creation, editing, comparison, anal-\nysis, storage, . . . Scala is ideal for the explo-\nration of tunings and becoming familiar with\nthe concepts involved.‚Äù\nThe Scala program comes with a dataset of over 3900 scales\nranging from historical harpsichord temperaments over eth-\nnic scales to scales used in contemporary music. Tarsos can\nparse and export scala Ô¨Åles. Their use should become appar-\nent in section 4.5.\n4.2 Analysis\nDuring analysis each block of audio is examined and zero,\none or more fundamental frequencies are assigned. The\nblock size and the number of extracted frequencies depend\non the underlying fundamental frequency detection algo-\nrithm. Several detection algorithm implementations are dis-\ntributed together with Tarsos and thanks to its modular de-\nsign new ones can be added. For practical purposes platform-\nindependent - pure Java - implementations of YIN [4] and\n4FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert audio\nand video. It has decoding support for a plethora of audio formats.INPUT\nANALYSIS\nREPRESENTATION\nOPTIMIZATION\nOUTPUTAnnotation\nselection\nPeak\nselection\nAuditory\nfeedbackScala\nFigure 3 . The main Ô¨Çow of information within Tarsos.\nMPM [8] are available without any conÔ¨Åguration. Currently\nthere is also support for the MAMI-detector [2] and for any\nV AMP-plugin [1] that generates frequency annotations. These\nexternal detectors are platform dependant and need some\nconÔ¨Åguration but once correctly conÔ¨Ågured their use is com-\npletely transparent: the generated annotations are transformed\nto a uniÔ¨Åed format, cached and then used for representation.\n4.3 Representation\nThe most straightforward representation of pitch annotations\nis plotting them over time. This results in a piano-roll like\nview. In monophonic music this visualizes the melody. In\npolyphonic music it shows information about harmonic struc-\ntures and the melodic contour. The piano-roll aids transcrip-\ntion and makes repeating melodic patterns visible. Figure 4\nshows a screenshot of Tarsos, the piano roll representation is\nmarked with 3. With the interactive user interface the piano\nroll representation can be used to select an area of annota-\ntions you are interested in. This can be used to ignore anno-\ntations below a certain pitch threshold (e.g. pitched percus-\nsion) or to compare the Ô¨Årst part of a song with the second\npart. The selection - represented by the upwards arrow be-\ntween analysis and representation in Figure 3 - inÔ¨Çuences\nthe next representation.\n171Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\nFigure 4 . A screenshot of Tarsos: 1) a pitch class histogram, 2) a pitch class interval table, 3) a piano roll like view on\nannotations, 4) a MIDI keyboard and 5) a waveform. Tarsos is available on http://tarsos.0110.be .\nWithin Tarsos the pitch histogram is constructed by as-\nsigning each annotation to a bin between 0 and 12√ó1200 =\n14400 cents, spanning 12 octaves. The height of each peak\nrepresents the total duration of a particular detected absolute\npitch within a piece. As mentioned in section 3 to transform\nthe pitch histogram to a pitch class histogram all values are\nfolded to one octave. In the pitch class histogram a peak\nrepresents the total duration of a detected pitch class within\na piece. An example of a pitch class histogram can be seen\nin Figure 2 or the area marked with 1 in Figure 4.\nA more high level, musicologically more meaningful rep-\nresentation is the pitch interval matrix . It is constructed by\napplying automatic or manually adjusted peak detection on\nthe pitch class histogram and extracting the positions of the\npitch classes. It contains the tone scale of a song and the\nintervals between the pitch classes.An example of a pitch\ninterval matrix extracted from the pitch class histogram in\nFigure 2 can be seen in Table 1. In the screenshot, Figure 4\nit is marked as 2.\n4.4 Optimisation\nAutomatic peak extraction may yield unwanted results. There-\nfore there is a possibility to adjust this process manually.\nAdding, removing or shifting peak locations is possible with\nthe pitch class histogram user interface. Changing the posi-\ntion of a peak has an immediate effect on all other represen-tations: the pitch interval matrix is reconstructed, the refer-\nence lines in the pitch histogram and piano roll are adjusted\naccordingly.\n4.5 Output\nTarsos contains export capabilities for each representation,\nfrom the pitch annotations to the pitch class interval ma-\ntrix there are built-in functions to export the data, either as\ncomma separated text Ô¨Åles or as image Ô¨Åles. Since Tarsos\nhas a scriptable, documented API which can be accessed by\nany Java Virtual Machine (JVM) compatible programming\nlanguage - Groovy, Scala5, Clojure, Java - there is also a\npossibility to add new output formats based on the internal\nobject model. Scripting is also the way to go when process-\ning a large number of Ô¨Åles.\nAs previously mentioned, for pitch class data there is a\nspecial standardized text Ô¨Åle format deÔ¨Åned by the Scala\nprogram: the scala Ô¨Åle with the .scl extension. Scala Ô¨Åles\ncan be used to compare different tone scales within Tarsos\nor with the Scala program. When used as input for Tar-\nsos, these Ô¨Åles provide a reference for the pitch class his-\ntogram extracted from audio. A scala Ô¨Åle e.g. extracted\nfrom Figure 2 with pitch classes (107,363,585,833,1083)\n5Do not confuse the Scala programming language with the Scala soft-\nware tool for scale analysis.

A pitch interval matrix with pitch classes and pitch\nclass intervals, both in cents. The peaks detected in Figure 2\nare used.\ncan be used to compare pitch use of a song recorded in the\nsame geographical area: do they both use the same absolute\npitch or the same pitch intervals?\nThe pitch annotations can also be synthesized. This re-\nsults in an audio Ô¨Åle which can be used to check if the anno-\ntations make sense. Overlapping the original sound with the\nsynthesized annotations makes clear when no, or incorrect\nannotations were made and, conversely when annotations\nare correct. This auditory feedback can be used to decide if\nthe annotations are trustworthy (the upwards arrow starting\nfrom output in Figure 3).\nA completely different output modality is MIDI . The\nMIDI Tuning Standard deÔ¨Ånes MIDI messages to specify the\ntuning of MIDI synthesizers. Tarsos can construct Bulk\nTuning Dump -messages based on extracted pitch class data\nto tune a synthesizer enabling the user to play along with a\nsong in tune. Tarsos contains the Gervill synthesizer, one of\nthe few (software) synthesizers that offer support for tuning\nmessages.5. APPLICATIONS\nThis section illustrates how Tarsos enables or facilitates re-\nsearch on pitch use. The examples given could inspire third\nparty users - musicologists - to try Tarsos and use it to solve\ntheir own research questions.\nA Ô¨Årst example is an analysis on a single African Ô¨Åddle\npiece. In African music pentatonic scales are common but\nthis piece uses a tetratonic scale as seen in Figure 5. The\nscale is a result of a playing style with three - more or less\nequally spaced - Ô¨Ångers and an open string. The graphical\ninterface of Tarsos was used to compare the second minute\nof the song with the seventh, this can be accomplished by se-\nlecting the annotations in the piano roll window. This shows\nthat the open string lost tension during the performance - it\nstarted to sound lower - in stark contrast with the other pitch\nclasses. The results were exported using the L ATEX-export\nfunction and are shown in Figure 5.\nA second example illustrates what can be done with a\nscript that processes a lot of audio Ô¨Åles in batch and the Tar-\nsos API. In an article by Bozkurt [6] pitch histograms are\nused for - amongst other tasks - makam6recognition. The\ntask is to identify which of nine makams is used in a speciÔ¨Åc\nsong. A simpliÔ¨Åed, generalized implementation of this task\nwas scripted. With this script it is possible to correctly iden-\ntify 39% of the makams using a dataset of 800 Ô¨Åles. Some\nmakams look very much alike: if the Ô¨Årst three guesses are\nevaluated the correct makam is present in 75% of the cases.\nThe example is fully documented in the Tarsos manual avail-\nable on the website http://tarsos.0110.be , also the\nsource code is available there. This method is very general\nand directly applicable to e.g. harpsicord tuning estimation\nas done, using another approach, by Tidhar et al [12].\n6A maqam deÔ¨Ånes rules for a composition or performance of classical\nTurkish music. It speciÔ¨Åes melodic shapes and pitch intervals.\n173Oral Session 2: Non-Western Music\n6. CONCLUSION, DISCUSSION AND FUTURE\nWORK\nIn this paper Tarsos was presented, a modular software plat-\nform to extract and analyze pitch organization in music. Af-\nter an introduction explaining the background and the needs\nfor precise pitch analysis, chapter two provided some con-\ntext about the method used and points to related work. Chap-\nter three gave a high level overview of the different compo-\nnents of Tarsos.\nCurrently Tarsos offers a decent foundation for research\non pitch but it also creates opportunities for future work.\nOne research idea is to reintroduce time domain informa-\ntion. By creating pitch class histograms for a sliding time-\nwindow and comparing those with each other it should be\npossible to detect sudden changes in pitch usage: modula-\ntions. Using this technique it should also be possible to de-\ntect and document pitch drift in choral or other music on a\nlarge scale. Automatic separation of speech and music could\nbe another application.\nAnother research area is to extract features on a large data\nset and use the pitch class histogram or interval data as a ba-\nsis for pattern recognition and cluster analysis. Using Tar-\nsos‚Äô scripting abilities with a timestamped and geotagged\nmusical archive it could be possible to detect geographical\nor chronological clusters of similar tone scale use.\nOn the longer term we plan to add comparable represen-\ntations of other musical parameters to Tarsos as well. In\norder to compare rhythmic and instrumental information,\ntemporal and timbral features will be included. Our ulti-\nmate goal is to develop an objective, albeit partial, view on\nmusic by combining those three parameters.\nDuring this type of research one should keep this quote\nin mind:\n‚ÄúAudio alone might not be sufÔ¨Åcient to un-\nderstand ethnic music. What does it mean to\ndescribe music from a culture where the word\n‚Äúmusic‚Äù exists only in connection to body move-\nment, smell, taste, colour. The idea of separat-\ning sound from the rest of its physical environ-\nment (movement, smell, taste, colour) may well\nbe a weird ‚Äúinvention‚Äù of the West. We can-\nnot understand ethnic music correctly without\nits social function and context [7].‚Äù\nHowever, we do can gain interesting insights and alleviate\naccessibility problems, which is what we are aiming for.\n7.

INTRODUCTION\nThe Structural Analysis of Large Amounts of Musical In-\nformation (SALAMI) project is a musicological endeavour \nwhose goal is to produce structural analyses for a very \nlarge amount of music‚Äîover 300,000 recordings. Here structure refers to the partitioning of  a piece of  music into sections and the grouping together of similar or repeated sections. These sections usually correspond to functionally independent sections, such as the ‚Äúverse‚Äù and ‚Äúchorus‚Äù sections of a pop song, the ‚Äúexposition‚Äù and ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù \nof  a sonata‚Äîor, at a shorter timescale, the exposition‚Äôs \n‚Äúmain theme,‚Äù ‚Äútransition,‚Äù and ‚Äúsecondary theme‚Äù groups.\nThe recordings in the SALAMI corpus represent an \nenormous range of genres, from klezmer to top-40 pop, and a variety of sources, including professional studio record-ings and audience-recorded live sessions. The SALAMI dataset, which will be made freely available, could be of great service to music theorists, musicologists, and other music researchers, since determining the form of  an indi-\nvidual piece of  music is generally a time-consuming task. The SALAMI dataset could facilitate large-scale studies of \nform, which presently are relatively uncommon.\nBecause of the value of  knowing the structure of pieces \nof  music, the pursuit of  algorithms that produce structural descriptions automatically is an active area of  research. (For a review see [9].) The SALAMI project plans to use a selection of  these algorithms to analyze its hundreds of thousands of  recordings. However, before these algorithms can be used, it is necessary to validate their performance on \nthe vast array of genres represented. This demands the \ncreation of a human-annotated ground truth dataset. The design and creation of  a large database such as the SA-LAMI test set raises many methodological issues relating to the choice of  music, annotation format, and procedure. This paper explains the issues involved and the decisions we made to address them. \nThe next section of  this work summarizes the content \nand contributions of  several existing corpora of  structural \nannotations, as well as important recent research on the annotation process itself [1, 10]. Section 3 describes the creation of the SALAMI test set, including the corpus se-lection, the annotation format used, and the recommended workflow. Some properties of the resulting dataset are pre-sented and discussed in Section 4.\n2.

Thus ‚Äúclassical‚Äù refers to all \nWestern art music; ‚Äúpopular‚Äù refers to most modern commercial music, including The Cure and Autechre; and so forth for ‚Äújazz‚Äù and ‚Äúworld.‚Äù\n555Poster Session 4\nles studio catalogue created by Alan Pollack and synchro-\nnized independently by two groups [5, 14] (180 annota-tions); and the AIST Annotation set [4] that accompanies \nthe RWC Music Database (285 annotations). The RWC set \nis approximately half  popular music, and one quarter each jazz and classical, with an additional few world music pieces, but for many of  the jazz and classical pieces only the ‚Äúchorus‚Äù sections are indicated.\n2.2 Annotation formatsNearly all previous corpora of annotations have used the \nsame straightforward annotation format. Pieces are seg-\nmented into non-overlapping sections, and every section is \ngiven a single label, such as ‚Äúintro‚Äù or ‚Äúchorus,‚Äù to indicate which are similar to or repetitions of  one another. The la-bels also suggest the musical role or function of each sec-tion. In some corpora, such as the Beatles annotations [5], labels may indicate instrumentation (e.g., ‚Äúverse_guitar‚Äù) or variations on a section (e.g., ‚Äúverse_with_ending‚Äù).\n2.2.1 Issues with previous formats\nAs pointed out in Peeters and Deruty [10], this conflation \nof  musical similarity, function, and instrumentation is prob-lematic. For instance, a song‚Äôs ‚Äúoutro‚Äù may use the same music as an earlier ‚Äútransition,‚Äù but labelling them as such fails to record their similarity. Contrariwise, a section with a single function may be musically heterogenous, as with an extended two-part introduction. Peeters and Deruty also \ncriticized the large, seemingly unconstrained vocabularies \nused in certain collections of annotations. Consider again the Isophonics Beatles annotations [5]: of  the 146 unique labels, 95 are used just once. Single-use labels may be in-formative to a human inspecting the annotation, where their meaning is understandable in context (e.g., ‚Äúintro_redux,‚Äù ‚Äúverse_(slow)‚Äù), but having too many unique labels is less useful when the annotations are being used by a machine. \nAnother drawback of  the standard annotation format is that \nit only describes the structure at a single timescale. One of the most important attributes of  musical structure is that it is perceived hierarchically, and it would be ideal to capture some of this information in an annotation.\n2.2.2 An alternative formatPeeters and Deruty proposed an alternative annotation for-\nmat intended to resolve these problems. The format uses a \nrestricted vocabulary of 19 labels, each of  which addresses \none of  three aspects of  a piece‚Äôs structure: either musical similarity, musical role, or instrument role. In their format, musical similarity is indicated by labelling every portion of a piece as one of  five ‚ÄúConstitutive Solid Loops‚Äù (CSLoops). (If more than five are required, a sixth CSLoop is used, although the format does not imply that all sections labelled with this last label are similar.) Function labels are \noptional and are restricted to ‚Äúintro/outro,‚Äù ‚Äútransition,‚Äù ‚Äúchorus,‚Äù and ‚Äúsolo.‚Äù Instrumentation labels indicate \nwhether a primary or supporting melodic voice is present.\nPeeters and Deruty‚Äôs format also creatively incorporates \nsome hierarchical information about the structure. Two \nmarkers, ‚ÄúV1‚Äù and ‚ÄúV2,‚Äù divide CSLoops; the first indi-cates that the musical segments on either side of  the marker are similar, the second that they are dissimilar.\n2.3 Annotation proceduresUnlike pitch and, to a large extent, beat, the perception of \nstructure is a highly subjective phenomenon, and it is common for two listeners to disagree on the form of  a piece \nof  music. It is therefore challenging to develop an annota-\ntion procedure that, while perhaps not being objective, maximizes the repeatability of  the results. Note that since a structural analysis records a listener‚Äôs creative interpreta-tion as much as her perception, objectivity is arguably an impossible goal for annotations.\nOne approach is to treat the creation of annotations as a \nperceptual experiment, and simply have multiple subjects \nlisten to a piece and press a button whenever they perceive \na structural boundary. Such data were collected by [2], who noted that listeners generally agreed on the placement of boundaries that they judged most salient. These boundaries were used as a type of  ‚Äúground truth‚Äù by the authors to evaluate the success of some computational models at es-timating boundaries.\nBimbot et al. [1] managed to obtain a degree of repeat-\nability by precisely specifying an annotation procedure. They defined the musical criteria and similarity judgements an annotator should use in order to estimate boundaries. (The task of  labelling the segments remains future work.) They reported that with their procedure, annotations were very consistent across annotators and over time. An annota-tor‚Äôs goal is to decompose a piece into ‚Äúautonomous and \ncomparable blocks.‚Äù Autonomy means that whether a block \nstands alone or is looped continuously, the result should be musically acceptable. Two blocks may be comparable if they have the same duration in beats, are interchangeable, or are similar with respect to their temporal organization.\n3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE SALAMI TEST SET\nWe developed a new corpus of  annotations using a unique \nannotation format to address the goals of the SALAMI pro-\nject. To ensure that the corpus was useful as an evaluation \ntest set for SALAMI, the main design consideration was for the corpus to cover as wide a variety of musical genres as possible. For the annotations to be musicologically useful, the design goals for the annotation format were to have musical similarity, function, and lead instrumentation de-scribed independently, and for the annotations to reflect the hierarchical nature of  musical structure. Finally, the format \nand the procedure should allow annotations to be produced \nquickly, to minimize cost, but be flexible enough to handle \n55612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nworks from a wide range of  genres, all while aiming for \nhigh inter-annotator agreement. With these design consid-erations in mind, we conducted a survey of  previous cor-\npora of  annotations and existing annotation techniques. \nBased on this survey and on our own experimentation with different approaches, we settled on the corpus, format, and procedure outlined in this section.\n3.1 Contents of SALAMI test setThe first step in designing the corpus was deciding what to \nput in it. One of  SALAMI‚Äôs priorities was to provide struc-tural analyses for as wide a variety of  music as possible, to \nmatch the diversity of music to be analyzed by the algo-\nrithms. In addition to popular music, the SALAMI test set should pay equal attention to classical, jazz, and non-Western music known colloquially as ‚Äúworld‚Äù music. To ensure a diversity of  recording formats, we also empha-sized the inclusion of  live recordings. The final composi-tion of the database is shown in Table 1.\nA secondary goal of  the SALAMI test set was to be able \nto compare our annotations with those of  previous data \nsets. We thus duplicated some previous work: our test set presently includes 97  and 35 recordings from the RWC and Isophonics data sets, respectively. Note that these re-cordings are all single-keyed (i.e., annotated by a single person), whereas most of  the SALAMI test-corpus is double-keyed (analyzed by two independent annotators). \nDouble-keying provides useful information but is more \nexpensive. Single-keying some entries seemed to be a rea-sonable compromise given that other groups had already annotated these pieces.\nClass Double \nkeyedSingle \nkeyedTotal Percentage\nClassical 159 66 225 16%\nJazz 225 12 237 17%\nPopular 205 117 322 23%\nWorld 186 31 217 16%\nLive music 273 109 382 28%\nTotal 1048 335 1383 100%\nTable 1.  Number of  pieces of  each class in the SALAMI \ntest set. Single and double keying refers to the number of annotators (2 or 1, respectively) who independently ana-\nlyzed each song.\nSelecting songs for the corpus by hand would be time-\nconsuming and would introduce unknown methodological bias. However, selecting songs randomly from most sources would result in a corpus heavily skewed toward popular music. To resolve this, most of  the recordings were collected from Codaich [7], a large database with carefully curated metadata, including over 50 subgenre labels. This \nenabled us to enforce good coverage of  genres while still choosing individual pieces randomly. The remainder of the \ntest set was collected randomly from the Live Music Ar-chive [6]. Unfortunately, metadata for these recordings is \ninconsistent and a distribution by genre could not be en-\nforced. The majority appears to be popular and jazz music.\n3.2 Annotation formatWe developed a new annotation format that takes after the \nformat devised by Peeters and Deruty in many important ways: we borrow their tripartite distinction between labels that indicate musical similarity, function, and instrumenta-tion, and like them we also strictly limit the vocabulary of \nfunction labels. However, we have made several modifica-\ntions to suit SALAMI‚Äôs unique needs and more musi-cological focus. The labels in each of the three layers are described in the following three sections. An example an-notation is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1.  Example to illustrate proposed format.\n3.2.1 Musical similarity track\nThe musical similarity track includes two layers at different \ntimescales, each identifying which portions of the piece use \nsimilar musical ideas. The large-scale layer uses uppercase letters as labels (‚ÄúA,‚Äù ‚ÄúB,‚Äù etc.) and the small-scale layer uses lowercase letters (‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúb,‚Äù etc.). The use of  letter la-bels mimics the familiar music-theoretical approach. Every portion of  a recording in both large- and small-scale layers must be assigned a letter label. The format specification allows any number of  lowercase or uppercase letters to be \nused (the labels ‚Äúaa,‚Äù ‚Äúab,‚Äù and so on may be used if  the \nalphabet is exhausted). However, for the large-scale layer, annotators were instructed to prefer to use five or fewer distinct uppercase labels per recording. This preference rule does not express an assumption that there are five or fewer distinct musical ideas in any recording. Rather, it is in-tended to guide the annotator toward a certain level of  ab-straction. This direction proved useful when annotating \nworks that are less clearly organized into distinct sections, \nsuch as through-composed pieces. It also helps when anno-tating works such as sonatas that may be organized into sections, but where these sections are not musically ho-mogenous and may include several distinct musical ideas.\nTwo additional special labels indicate silence (‚Äúsilence‚Äù) \nand non-music, such as applause or banter in a live record-\n557Poster Session 4\ning (‚ÄúZ‚Äù). We also allow letter labels to be inflected by the \nprime symbol ( ‚Ä≤ ) to indicate a section that is evidently \nsimilar to another, but that is judged to be substantially \nvaried. Similarity judgements are inherently subjective and \nimprecise, and the prime symbol is a useful way of  ac-knowledging this. It allows the annotator to faithfully re-cord his interpretation, while allowing future users to easily adapt the labels according to their needs. For instance, de-pending on the application, a user may excise the prime markers (so that ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúa ‚Ä≤‚Äù are both relabelled as ‚Äúa‚Äù) or \nto treat variations as distinct sections (so that ‚Äúa ‚Ä≤‚Äù would be \nreassigned a letter label different from ‚Äúa‚Äù).\n3.2.2 Function track\nThe second track in the annotation format contains the \nmusic function labels, which all must be drawn from our strict vocabulary of  20 labels. Unlike the letter labels, it is not mandatory that every portion of  a piece receive a func-tion label. The vocabulary is listed in Table 2, separated into various relevant categories. The instrumental, transi-\ntion, and ending groups are all synonym groups. Note that \nin the ending group, the label ‚Äúfadeout‚Äù is a special label that can occur in addition to any other label. For example, if the piece fades out over a repetition of  the chorus, then the last section may be given both labels: ‚Äúchorus‚Äù and ‚Äúfadeout.‚Äù Full definitions for each term are specified in our Annotator‚Äôs Guide, available online [11].\nBasic group intro, verse, chorus, brid ge\nInstrumental instrumental, solo\nTransition transition, pre-chorus, pre-verse, \ninterlude\nGenre-specific head, main theme, (secondary) theme\nForm-specific exposition, development, recapitulation\nEnding outro, coda, fadeout\nSpecial labels silence, end\nTable 2.  List of  permitted function words in proposed an-\nnotation format.\nNote that some of the labels are genre-specific alterna-\ntives to others: for example, the ‚Äúhead‚Äù in a jazz song is analogous to a ‚Äúchorus‚Äù in a pop song or, sometimes, a ‚Äúmain theme‚Äù in a classical piece. Also, together, the terms \n‚Äúexposition,‚Äù ‚Äúdevelopment,‚Äù and ‚Äúrecapitulation‚Äù are spe-\ncific to sonata form and may in special cases be used to annotate a third level of  structural relationships at a time-scale larger than the large-scale similarity labels. However, ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù also has wider applicability: it may be used to indicate the function of  a contrasting middle section, which is relevant in many contexts, from various classical genres to progressive rock. Additionally, some subsets of \nthe vocabulary can function as synonym-groups that can be \ncollapsed into a single function label if  desired. For exam-ple, while our Annotator‚Äôs Guide defines a relatively subtle \ndistinction between ‚Äúpre-chorus,‚Äù ‚Äúpre-verse,‚Äù ‚Äúinterlude,‚Äù and ‚Äútransition‚Äù sections, they are all synonyms of  ‚Äútransi-\ntion.‚Äù This approach allows annotators to err on the side of \nprecision, while enabling future users of  the data to ignore distinctions that are unneeded.\n3.2.3 Lead instrument trackThe final track in the annotation format indicates wherever \na single instrument or voice takes on a leading, usually melodic role. The labels in this track are simply the names of  the leading instruments, and hence the vocabulary is not \nconstrained. Also, unlike the other tracks, lead instrument \nlabels may potentially overlap, as in a duet. Note that as with the function track, there may be portions of  the re-cording with no lead instrument label, if  no instrument ful-fills a leading role.\nNote that in the written format devised for this project, \nthe boundaries delineating the small-scale similarity seg-ments are the only available boundaries when annotating \nthe function and lead instrumentation tracks. Again, this \nhelps orient annotators to an appropriate level of abstrac-tion, and relieves them of too painstakingly indicating the instrumentation changes.\n3.3 Annotation procedureThe annotators used the software Sonic Visualiser [3] to \naudition and annotate the pieces. Sonic Visualiser‚Äôs key-\nboard commands allow one to insert and label boundaries \nquite quickly. We suggested the following workflow: first, listen through the song and mark a boundary whenever a structural boundary is perceived. Second, listen to the piece again, adjusting boundaries and adding lowercase labels. Third, add the uppercase and function labels, and finally add the lead instrument labels. While we found this work-flow to be efficient and straightforward, we did not demand \nthat annotators follow this or any other specific workflow.\n3.4 Project realizationThe annotation format and data collection took place over \nthe course of  10 months. First, previous annotation formats and databases of  annotations were researched. Potential annotation formats were devised and tested by the project leaders, and a tentative format was set at the end of  two months. Next, candidate annotators were trained in the an-\nnotation format and in the Sonic Visualiser environment. \nEight successful candidates were hired, all pursuing gradu-ate studies in either Music Theory or Composition, and data collection began the following week. Because the an-notation format had not been tested on a significant scale before work began in earnest, the first six weeks of  data collection were conceived as an extended trial period. Every week or two, annotators were given a new batch of \nassignments in a new genre, beginning with popular, which \n55812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwas expected to be the least problematic, and continuing in \norder with jazz, classical, and world, which were predicted to be of  increasing difficulty. At the end of  the six weeks, \nsupervision of the annotators was relaxed and any problems \naddressed on an ad hoc  basis. Data collection continued \nover the next 12 weeks, by which point the majority of assignments had been completed.\nWe collected the self-reported time it took to produce \neach annotation in order to assess productivity. The times are plotted as a function of  the date for the first 1700 anno-tations in Figure 2. It can be seen that, disregarding a num-\nber of  outliers towards the beginning of the project, annota-\ntion time decreased modestly, from a mode of  20 minutes in the first 100 days, to a mode of  15 minutes in the re-mainder, enough for 3 full listenings of  the average song, which was 4:21 long. The average annotation time also dropped from 21 to 17 minutes. Earlier analysis showed a slight correlation between a song‚Äôs length and its annota-tion time.\n3.4.1 Annotation format and procedure revisions\nAfter each new assignment, we solicited feedback from the \nannotators on what weaknesses or ambiguities in the anno-tation format and procedure were revealed. Most issues were addressed and resolved at regular group meetings, where we also planned and agreed on the vocabulary. Feedback led to the introduction of  new heuristics (e.g., we \nestablished a preference to have segment boundaries fall on \ndownbeats, even in the presence of  pickups). In one case, feedback led to a major revision of  the format. We origi-nally used the ‚ÄúV1‚Äù and ‚ÄúV2‚Äù markers described by [10] to implicitly encode musical similarity at a shorter timescale. However, annotators found that explicitly describing the structure at both timescales was both conceptually simpler and quicker. Annotators were satisfied by the switch and \nthe subsequent annotations also had more information.\n4.  RESULTS\nIn this section we report certain properties of  the collected \ndata, including inter-annotator agreement.\nThe average number of  segments per annotation was \n11.3 for the large-scale analyses, with half  of  the analyses having between 8 and 14 segments. These figures were 38.4 and between 20 and 49 for the small-scale analyses. \nOn average, there were 4.0 unique large-scale labels and \n7.2 unique small-scale labels per annotation.\nFrom the variety of  measures used to compare two anno-\ntations (defined in [12], among others), we estimated the pairwise f-measure, boundary f-measure, and Rand index. \nBoundary f-measure is found by observing the precision \nand recall with which one set of boundaries matches the other set. Boundaries match if they lie within some toler-\nance window (0.5 or 3 seconds) of each other. Pairwise f-\nmeasure treats all pairs of  frames with the same label in one description as a set of  similarity relationships that the \nother description retrieves with some precision and recall. The Rand index is similar except that it also identifies how \nmany pairs of frames with different labels in one descrip-\ntion also have different labels in the other. The agreement between 974 pairs of annotations is reported in Table 3.\nFigure 2 .

Average agreement between 974 pairs of annota-\ntions, as estimated by four similarity metrics (pairwise f-\nmeasure, Rand index, and boundary f-measure with two \nthresholds) when comparing: (1) both annotators‚Äô large-\nscale annotations; (2) both small-scale annotations;  (3) one annotator‚Äôs large-scale annotation and the other‚Äôs small-scale one. The last row (4) takes the maximum similarity of all four possible pairings between the first and second an-notators‚Äô musical similarity labels.\nEach annotation describes musical similarity at two lev-\nels of  detail, both of  which should be considered valid de-\nscriptions. To compare two annotations, we may compare \nthe large-scale labels only or the small-scale labels only, but we may also find the similarity of all pairs (including small-to-large and large-to-small) and take the maximum similarity to estimate the inter-annotator agreement. This will allow us to recognize cases where the annotators have focused on different timescales. As seen in Table 3, the agreement between large-scale labels (pairwise f = 0.76, \nRand = 0.79) is comparable to that between small-scale \nlabels (pairwise f = 0.69, Rand= 0.81), and the average best \nmatch found is slightly higher than each (pairwise f = 0.81, \nRand = 0.87). For comparison, [8] reported a pairwise f of \n0.89 on a test set of  30 songs from the TUT set, and [1] 0255075100\n0 100 200 300 400Time to annotate, in minutes\nTime completed after project start date, in days\n559Poster Session 4\nreported a boundary f measure of 0.91 (using a 0.75-second \nthreshold) on a test set of 20 songs.\nThe agreement was not found to depend greatly on the \ngenre. This is reasonable since each of the broad genres \nconsidered here are each very diverse and contain some straightforward and some complex pieces. For instance, the popular genre includes both straightforward pop music and more difficult to annotate progressive rock; likewise, though much world music poses a challenge to annotators, subgenera such as klezmer and Celtic music can be struc-turally straightforward.\nWe replicated annotations for 97 recordings in the RWC \ndata set. The RWC annotations distinguish similar and identical repetitions of sections by adding letters to func-tion labels (e.g., ‚Äúverse A‚Äù, ‚Äúverse B‚Äù, etc.). We created two versions of  the RWC labels, one retaining and one ignoring the additional letter labels. These were compared to the large- and small-scale SALAMI annotations, revealing modest agreement (see Table 4). Aside from the Rand in-\ndex, the results indicate that the large-scale SALAMI \nanalyses are more similar to the RWC annotations than the small-scale analyses.\n5.  CONCLUSION\nThe SALAMI test set has over 2400 annotations describing \nthe formal structure of  almost 1400 pieces of music, from a wide variety of genres, including popular, jazz, classical, \nand world music. This set may be used for a variety of  fu-\nture studies: for example, on the connection between the surface characteristics of  music and the perception of musi-cal form, or between formal styles and musical parameters such as artist, genre, and place of  origin. The test data and the hundreds of thousands of  computed structural descrip-tions will soon be reachable from our website [11].\nWhile the worth of the corpus will ultimately depend on \nthe use researchers make of  it, the quantity and richness of \nthe information in the SALAMI test set should make it attractive to musicologists and music information retrieval researchers alike.\n6.

Automatic sys-\ntems for music emotion recognition rely on ground truth\ndata collected from humans, and more effective meth-\nods for collecting such data are being continuously devel-\noped. In previous work, we developed MoodSwings, an\nonline collaborative game for crowdsourcing dynamic (per-\nsecond) mood ratings from multiple players within the two-\ndimensional arousal-valence (A-V) representation of emo-\ntion. MoodSwings has proven effective for data collection,\nbut potential data effects caused by collaborative labeling\nhave not yet been analyzed. In this work, we compare the\neffectiveness of MoodSwings to that of a more traditional\ndata collection method, where annotation is performed by\nsingle, paid annotators. We implement a simpliÔ¨Åed labeling\ntask to run on Amazon‚Äôs crowdsourcing engine, Mechanical\nTurk (MTurk), and analyze the labels collected with each\nmethod. A statistical comparison shows consistencies be-\ntween MoodSwings and MTurk data, and we produce simi-\nlar results using each as training data for automatic emotion\nproduction via supervised machine learning. Furthermore\nthe new dataset collected via MTurk has been made avail-\nable to the Music Information Retrieval community.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe problem of automated emotion (mood) recognition\nwithin music has recently received increased attention\nwithin the music information retrieval (Music-IR) research\ncommunity [1]. The perceptual nature of emotion ne-\ncessitates that such systems be trained on ground truth\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.data collected from humans, and the Music-IR commu-\nnity could beneÔ¨Åt from further development and evalua-\ntion of methods for collecting such data. In prior work,\nwe created MoodSwings, an online collaborative game for\ncollecting per-second labels of music, based on the two-\ndimensional arousal-valence (A-V) model of emotion [2,3].\nMoodSwings captures emotion changes in synchrony with\nmusic and collects a distribution of multiple players‚Äô labels\nfor each moment in a song. These quantitative labels are\nwell suited to computational parameter estimation and su-\npervised machine learning [4‚Äì6].\nInitial studies of the game‚Äôs effectiveness found that an-\nnotators settle upon their Ô¨Ånal ratings faster when play-\ning against a partner (as opposed to random AI, which\nsimulates a partner‚Äôs participation when an odd number\nof players are online) [7]. However, the effects of col-\nlaborative annotation on the quality of ratings have yet to\nbe established. In this work we compare MoodSwings to\na more traditional data collection method via Amazon‚Äôs\nMechanical Turk (MTurk),1an online crowdsourcing en-\ngine. Through the construction of Human Intelligence Tasks\n(HITs), MTurk connects researchers with human subjects\nfrom all over the web and provides a means for payment. We\ndesign a traditional A-V labeling task, employing MTurk\nworkers to label a dataset consisting of 240, 15-second clips\npreviously annotated via MoodSwings [4]. We examine the\ncollected labels to comparatively analyze our game versus\ntraditional data collection.\nThe monetary incentives of MTurk unavoidably inject\nnoise into our labels. This becomes an issue for data quality\nas it is undesirable to pay for unsatisfactory work. MTurk\nallows us to deny workers payment if they do not properly\ncomplete the task, and we develop an outlier detection al-\ngorithm to automatically detect such workers. In an attempt\nto reduce bias, the system relies on the use of expert an-\nnotators‚Äô labels as a baseline when trying to validate anno-\ntations. It Ô¨Ålters out workers who demonstrate unwilling-\nness to correctly perform the task. We compare the ‚Äúclean‚Äù\nMTurk dataset to labels from our game statistically, and with\n1http://mturk.com\n549Poster Session 4\nrespect to automatic mood prediction accuracy. The new\ndataset collected via MTurk has been made available to the\nMusic Information Retrieval community.2\n2. BACKGROUND\nThe natural language processing (NLP) [8] and machine vi-\nsion [9, 10] communities have utilized MTurk extensively,\nbut machine listening and Music-IR have been slow to adopt\nits use. Lee found crowdsourcing music similarity judg-\nments on MTurk to be less time-consuming than collecting\ndata from experts in the research community [11]. The ex-\nperiment cost $130.90 and produced 6,732 similarity judge-\nments, less than $0.02 per rating. HITs were rejected if\nworkers rated songs too quickly or failed to assign high sim-\nilarity to identical songs. While nearly half of all HITs were\nrejected, the dataset was obtained an order of magnitude\nmore quickly than in their previous attempts. Comparing the\ndatasets yields a Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefÔ¨Åcient of 0.495,\nconsistent with previous NLP work involving MTurk [8]. As\nthe previous data collection was assembled for MIREX, Lee\nreturned the submitted systems using MTurk data as ground\ntruth and found no signiÔ¨Åcant alterations to the outcome,\nscoring a 5.7% difference on the Friedman test.\nMandel et al. employed MTurk for collecting free form\ntags to study relationships between audio tags and content\n[12]. The group collected 2,100 unique tags across 925\nclips, for a reported cost of approximately $100. To en-\nsure data quality, they rejected a HIT if any tag had more\nthan 25 characters, if less than 5 tags were provided, or\nif less than half of tags were contained in a dictionary of\ncommonly applied tags (Last.fm). All HITs by a particular\nworker were rejected if the worker used too small a vocabu-\nlary, if they used more than 15% ‚Äústop words‚Äù (e.g., ‚Äúmusic‚Äù\nor ‚Äúnice‚Äù), or if half of their individual HITs were rejected\nfor other reasons. The authors then trained a support vec-\ntor machine (SVM) classiÔ¨Åer for content-based autotagging.\nWith smoothed labels, the MTurk version increased perfor-\nmance to 63.4% versus 63.09% with MajorMiner.\n3. DATA COLLECTION METHODS\nIn previous work we designed MoodSwings, a collaborative\nonline game that leverages crowdsourcing to collect mood\nratings [2]. The game board is based on the A-V space,\nwhere the valence dimension represents positive versus neg-\native emotions and arousal represents high versus low en-\nergy [3]. Anonymously-partnered players label song clips\ntogether during each round, scoring points based on the\noverlap between their cursors, which encourages consensus.\nBonus points are awarded to a player whose partner moves\ntowards him/her, encouraging competition and discouraging\n2http://music.ece.drexel.edu/research/emotion/moodswingsturkplayers from blindly following their partners to score points.\nWe recently initiated a redesign effort, investigating game-\nplay improvements suggested by an analysis of collected la-\nbels [7]. However, we have not addressed concerns about\nthe game structure biasing annotations.\nWe designed a simpliÔ¨Åed labeling task, shown in Figure\n1, for MTurk. Single workers provide A-V labels for clips\nfrom our dataset, consisting of 240 15-second clips, which\nare extended to 30 seconds to give workers additional an-\nnotation practice [4]. As in MoodSwings, we collect per-\nsecond labels, but no partner is present and no points are\nawarded. Workers are given detailed instructions describing\nthe A-V space. They navigate to a website which hosts the\ntask and label 11 randomly-chosen clips. The Ô¨Årst clip is\na practice round, omitted from our analysis. The third and\nninth are identical, randomly chosen from a set of 10 ‚ÄúveriÔ¨Å-\ncation clips,‚Äù which are evaluated to identify unsatisfactory\nwork. Workers are given a 6-digit veriÔ¨Åcation code to en-\nter on the MTurk website as proof of completion which, if\nsuccessful, earns workers $0.25 per HIT.\nFigure 1 . Screenshot of labeling task deployed on MTurk,\ndepicting the A-V space and a yellow orb as the annota-\ntor‚Äôs cursor. A sidebar provides additional instructions, e.g.\nworkers may type ‚ÄúB‚Äù if they encounter bugs in the task.\n4. FILTERING OF MECHANICAL TURK DATA\nAs previously discussed, quality control is an important is-\nsue with data collection on MTurk. In the labeling task, our\ninteractions with workers are extremely limited and workers\ncannot ask for clariÔ¨Åcation of instructions during the HIT. It\nis difÔ¨Åcult to gauge workers‚Äô understanding, and to deter-\nmine if they were blindly moving the cursor to earn $0.25\nfor entering a veriÔ¨Åcation code. Figure 2 shows examples of\n‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù data collected for two song clips. We ob-\ntained annotations from 272 unique workers, an average of 5\nHITs each. To determine which of the over 1,000 complete\n55012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 2 . ‚ÄúBad‚Äù (top) and ‚Äúgood‚Äù (bottom) worker data for\ntwo 30-second song clips. Labels get darker to show the\nprogression of time. Both ‚Äúbad‚Äù sets of labels indicate lack\nof understanding or attention to the task.\nlabeling sessions are valid, we utilize an automatic Ô¨Åltering\nsystem, which is trained on experts‚Äô annotations of our ver-\niÔ¨Åcation clips.\n4.1 Baseline for Validity: Expert Annotations\nWe evaluate workers‚Äô veriÔ¨Åcation clip labels to determine if\nthey completed the task correctly. The 10 veriÔ¨Åcation clips\nwere handpicked for their obvious mood transitions, e.g.,\nfrom low to high valence. Transitions occur near the middle\nof each clip. To provide a baseline for validity, ‚àº10 Music-\nIR researchers labeled the veriÔ¨Åcation clips twice each, dur-\ning two sessions (one week apart). To demonstrate that the\nexperts‚Äô labels provide a good baseline for validity, we mea-\nsure the consistency of their ratings between sessions. Con-\nsistent ratings indicate attentiveness and understanding of\nthe task, which characterize our expectations for correctly\ncompleted MTurk HITs.\nThe blue line in Figure 3 shows the normalized distances\nbetween the label distributions‚Äô means for each veriÔ¨Åca-\ntion clip in the two annotation sessions, averaged over time.\n(e.g., normalized mean distance between clip one in session\none and clip one in session two). As a baseline, the dashed\nline indicates the average distance over all individual clips\nfrom session 1 when they are compared to the combination\nof all remaining clips in session 2 (e.g., clip 1 from session\n1 compared to the combined labels from session 2 clips 2-\n10). For all clips, the normalized mean distances between\nsessions 1 and 2 are well below the average, demonstrating\nconsistent expert annotations over multiple trials.\nFigure 3 . Distance between labels‚Äô means for each clip in\nexpert annotation sessions 1 and 2, with error bars indicat-\ning¬±1 standard deviation. Dashed line indicates the aver-\nage distance between individual clips from session 1 and the\ncombination of all remaining clips from session 2.\n4.2 Automatic Filtering System\nWe wish to reject data from workers who move about the A-\nV space without paying attention or who misunderstand the\nmeanings of the A-V axes, but avoid rejecting valid ratings\nsimply because they differ from our own subjective opin-\nions. A one-class SVM for every second of each veriÔ¨Åcation\nclip is trained on the expert labels, then used to detect invalid\nworker data. The experts‚Äô labels differ enough between indi-\nviduals to account for many valid mood ratings, but to avoid\npenalizing workers for differences in opinion we only re-\nquire that workers‚Äô veriÔ¨Åcation clip labels fall within the de-\ncision boundary of the one-class SVM on average.\nFigure 4 . One-class SVM trained on expert data for one\nsecond of a veriÔ¨Åcation clip.

MoodSwings (left) and MTurk (right).\n4.2.1 Novelty Detection and One-Class SVM\nAs our data is unlabeled, we cannot formulate the identiÔ¨Åca-\ntion of valid labels as a traditional binary classiÔ¨Åcation prob-\nlem. The experts‚Äô labels exemplify how such labels may be\nclustered, a ‚Äúpositive class,‚Äù but we encounter an unknown\nnumber of ‚Äúnegative classes.‚Äù We use outlier (novelty) de-\ntection, training a supervised machine learning system on\nonly positive examples [13]. Our system uses the one-class\nSVM implementation from the SVM-KM toolbox.3We use\na Gaussian RBF kernel, tuning parameters to include most\ntraining data and exclude outliers. For a HIT to be approved,\nboth veriÔ¨Åcation clips must lie within our decision boundary\non average. Workers must be approved for at least 60% of\nHITs completed, else all of their HITs are rejected. After\nautomatic Ô¨Åltering, 113 workers had all HITs approved, and\n88 had all HITs rejected.\nBecause emotions cannot be classiÔ¨Åed by machines with\nperfect accuracy, we use human judgments to measure the\neffectiveness of our automatic system. Plots of individual\nworkers‚Äô labels for veriÔ¨Åcation clips were visually exam-\nined by the authors. Annotations were classiÔ¨Åed ‚Äúapproved‚Äù\nif they followed a similar trajectory to that of the experts‚Äô\nlabels over time, and ‚Äúrejected‚Äù if they rapidly jumped be-\ntween quadrants or moved in the opposite direction of ex-\npert labels. Ambiguous labels, for instance, those that did\nnot follow a smooth trajectory, but moved towards the same\nquadrant as expert data, were labeled ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù ClassiÔ¨Å-\ncation performance is shown in Table 1.\n5. ANALYSIS OF COLLECTED DATA\nThe system collected 4,064 label sequences after two stages\nof Ô¨Åltering: Ô¨Årst evaluating veriÔ¨Åcation clip labels, and then\nremoving labeling sessions of workers who kept the cursor\n3http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/ ‚àºarakotom/toolbox/index.htmlManual Annotation Number Accepted Number Rejected\nApproved 398 162\nRejected 147 527\nUnknown 89 67\nPrecision Recall F-Measure\n0.73 0.71 0.72\nTable 1 .

We analyzed only the last half of each 30-\nsecond annotation round so that the Ô¨Årst 15-seconds could\ngive workers time to contemplate the mood of each clip. We\nassume that the relatively small number of workers who did\nnot move after 15 seconds misunderstood the task, and thus\nÔ¨Åltered out their data. Table 2 shows statistics of the col-\nlected per-clip annotations in the dataset, before and after\nÔ¨Åltering.\nUnÔ¨Åltered VeriÔ¨Åcation Stage 2\nMetric Dataset Filtering Filtering\nMean 49.79 18.20 16.93\nSt. Dev. 4.328 2.480 2.690\nMax 72 24 23\nMin 39 8 7\nTable 2 .

MLR results for short-time (one-second) A-V labels, repeating the experiments of [5].\n5.1 Correlation Between Collected Labels\nWe compute Pearson‚Äôs product-moment correlation be-\ntween the datasets from MoodSwings and MTurk for each\ndimension. Pearson‚Äôs correlation between example random\nvariablesXandYis deÔ¨Åned as:\nœÅ=cov(X,Y )\nœÉXœÉY(1)\nTo account for discrepancies between the number of an-\nnotations for each clip, we treat their per-second sample\nmeans as observations. We smooth both sets of labels to\nreduce noise between observations, as the mood in each\nsecond of a song clip cannot be assumed to be indepen-\ndent from that of previous seconds [6]. The results, 0.712\nfor Arousal and 0.846 for Valence, show more correla-\ntion between the two datasets than Lee‚Äôs comparison of\na MTurk-collected dataset to similarly crowdsourced data\n[11]. High correlation provides evidence that annotators‚Äô\njudgments are unaffected by collaborating with a partner\nduring MoodSwings.\n5.2 Overall Distribution Comparison\nFigure 5 shows contour maps for the datasets collected with\nMoodSwings and MTurk. Both datasets have similar den-\nsities in the quadrant centers, though the MTurk dataset has\nhigher densities along the spaces‚Äô extremities, which could\nbe attributed to a larger sample. The MTurk dataset also\ncontains small peaks throughout the distribution, whereas\nthe MoodSwings set has more consistent clusters. It is difÔ¨Å-\ncult to pinpoint a cause for this difference, but multiple small\npeaks in the MTurk distribution may suggest that workers\nremain indecisive about their mood ratings throughout the\nduration of a clip. In previous work, we showed that it takes\n7-8 seconds on average for players to reach 85% of the to-\ntal distance from the origin to their Ô¨Ånal mood labels [7].\nBy contrast, it took MTurk workers 10-12 seconds to reach\nthe same distance percentage. Faster convergence towards\na mood decision in the game could imply that collaboration\nencourages annotators to re-evaluate their ratings earlier in\nthe clips, perhaps improving the quality of collected data.5.3 Performance in Emotion Prediction\nTo further establish correlation between the datasets, we use\neach as ground truth for the time-varying emotion predic-\ntion experiments of our previous work [5]. The predic-\ntion systems utilize supervised machine learning algorithms\nto map A-V labels to content-based audio features, e.g.,\nmel-frequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCCs), chroma, and\nstatistical spectrum descriptors (SSDs), including spectral\nshape and contrast. Prediction performance for each feature,\nas well as combined performance using a multi-layer regres-\nsion method for late-feature fusion, using multiple linear re-\ngression (MLR) is shown in Table 3. The results are similar:\nall features rank in the same order, and in terms of over-\nall mean distance there is only slight improvement for the\nMTurk dataset. In terms of KL-divergence, the MTurk sys-\ntem performs signiÔ¨Åcantly better. However, high KL values\nin [5] were later attributed to noisy distribution estimates at\none-second intervals, taken independently from other time\nslices [6]. Increased performance on the MTurk set can be\nsimilarly attributed to the larger per-second sample sizes.\nImprovements based on the quantity of data collected are\nunrelated to the question of whether or not collaborative la-\nbeling biases the annotators‚Äô judgments.\n6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThe strong positive correlation between data from\nMoodSwings and MTurk provides evidence that collaborat-\ning with a partner does not bias annotators‚Äô mood judgments\nany more than participating in a traditional labeling task.\nWe see similar mood prediction results between the label\nsets, although the MTurk set performs better with respect to\nKL-divergence. However, we attribute this increased per-\nformance to a larger sample size and propose that similar\nKL performance could be achieved if we collected a larger\nnumber of labels from MoodSwings. In terms of annotation\nquality, some evidence suggests that the game may be a su-\nperior data collection tool because it encourages participants\nto re-evaluate their ratings earlier in a labeling round. The\nset of labels from the MTurk annotation method is available\nto the Music-IR community for future research.\nThe logistics of each method are signiÔ¨Åcant considera-\n553Poster Session 4\ntions, particularly the pace of data collection and time spent\non quality control. Monetary incentives can attract anno-\ntators very quickly, but researchers must determine how to\nseparate anonymous paid annotators, e.g. MTurk workers,\nwith good intentions from those who wish to obtain pay-\nment for as little work as possible. We advise researchers\nseeking to crowdsource subjective judgments from paid an-\nnotators to be wary of the complexity of quality control. Our\none-class SVM system must be periodically retrained to ac-\ncount for varied mood judgments. As false approvals and re-\njections of mood labels are most accurately detected by hu-\nmans, this requires manual labeling, which can be very labor\nintensive. Crowdsourcing the veriÔ¨Åcation process may be a\nmore viable solution [14]. Reliable workers may be identi-\nÔ¨Åed through overall approval ratings available from MTurk\nand cold verify others‚Äô work in a separate task. However,\npaying a third party to verify results introduces further un-\ncertainty to the Ô¨Åltering process. We prefer to deal with vol-\nunteer annotators, who are more likely to produce quality\ndata without extensive Ô¨Åltering. Unpaid annotators do not\nbeneÔ¨Åt from producing a large quantity of low-quality an-\nnotations in a short amount of time. Because few people\nvolunteer for tedious traditional labeling tasks, we hope that\npresenting the task as a fun game will attract annotators.\nFurther mood prediction work necessitates more data col-\nlection. In particular, some of our planned work requires an-\nnotations for a much larger, more varied song set. We have\nfound the challenges of quality control for crowd-sourced\ndata collection need to be considered when choosing a col-\nlection method. While using MTurk is a viable option, we\nplan to concentrate some of our future efforts on improving\nMoodSwings. We wish to attract annotators to our game\nas quickly as we attracted them with payment on MTurk.\nThe redesign effort initiated with [7] made considerable\nstrides towards improving the game. Continuing this effort\nby revamping the user interface, deploying the game on mo-\nbile platforms (e.g., iOS and Android) or a social network-\ning website like Facebook.com and allowing participants to\nchoose their own music will provide a more varied and en-\nhanced gameplay experience. We hope these planned im-\nprovements will attract more annotators to our game. Deal-\ning with certain paid annotators‚Äô attempts to earn money for\nunsatisfactory work makes a strong case for employing vol-\nunteer annotators, who we believe are less likely to ‚Äúgame\nthe system.‚Äù\n7.

Importantly, this rich ob-\nservation elicits some of the nuances between various high-\nand low-technologies. In particular, we discuss issues of\nmultimodality and the role of technologies such as Youtube,\nas well as speciÔ¨Åc issues around musical concepts such as\ngenre and rhythm.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade the Ô¨Åeld of Music Information Re-\ntrieval (MIR) has blossomed, leading to the creation of many\nuseful analysis techniques and systems. We wish to increase\nthe beneÔ¨Åt of MIR techniques to society, and to help develop\nMIR in ways that connect with new use cases in real-world\ncontexts. This requires that we work with user groups di-\nrectly, adapting our approach and conceptual toolset to that\nof the user groups: in other words, it requires recognising\nthat MIR has its associated culture with its own assumptions\nand interests, which may differ from the assumptions and in-\nterests of a particular user group, and working to bridge any\ndivides. Connecting with user communities in this way is\nnot just a way to disseminate research outputs, but can bring\nfresh ideas and perspectives into the research process.\nThe present study was conducted in this spirit, with a spe-\nciÔ¨Åc view to investigate how new digital music technologies\nmight be developed or adapted for the school music context.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.This paper discusses some of the issues brought out from\nresearch conducted in London secondary schools over the\nperiod November 2010 ‚Äì March 2011. The full ethnographic\nanalysis cannot be represented in six pages; in this paper\nwe Ô¨Årst describe the setup of the study before considering a\nrange of Ô¨Åndings relevant for the MIR community. We dis-\ncuss the use of different musical concepts (Section 3) and\ndifferent technologies (Section 4), before ending with a dis-\ncussion reÔ¨Çecting on the lessons for the use of MIR technol-\nogy in the school music-lesson context.\n2. SETTING AND METHODS\nWe chose to use an ethnographic approach, so as to elicit\na rich thick description of the way music-related ideas are\nused and relate to each other in a speciÔ¨Åc context. The sen-\nsitising questions used to guide the ethnography were:\nWhat music-related concepts do teachers and\nstudents negotiate in music classes?\nHow do they achieve this ‚Äì with, and without,\ntechnology?\nWe note that such ‚Äúsensitising questions‚Äù do not serve as\nnarrow research questions to be answered speciÔ¨Åcally, but\nas a thematic core for the observations and analysis.\nThe study was conducted in music lessons at two sec-\nondary schools in London. The two schools were selected\nafter contacting a small selection of comprehensive secondary\nschools in the London area with music programmes.\n‚Ä¢School A was located in East London, with around\n1200 students. The school had ‚âà15% having special\neducational needs, and ‚âà50% obtaining Ô¨Åve or more\nA*‚ÄìC GCSEs and equivalent (a standard UK measure\nof attainment) in 2010. The music department had six\nfull-time music teachers.\n‚Ä¢School B was located in West London, with around\n1000 students. The school had ‚âà15% having special\neducational needs, and ‚âà30% obtaining Ô¨Åve or more\nA*‚ÄìC GCSEs and equivalent in 2010. The perform-\ning arts department had two full-time music teachers.\n347Oral Session 5: User Studies\nEach school ran a two-weekly timetable, meaning the visits\n(over the period November 2010 ‚Äì March 2011) typically\ncovered about six lessons of each particular class. Various\nsecondary-level lessons were included in the study (Year 7\nto Year 11, i.e. students aged approx. 11‚Äì16).\nObservations were conducted by one observer with note-\nbook and pen; to minimise disruption and facilitate access,\nvideo/audio recording were not used. Analysis of the Ô¨Åeld-\nnotes was conducted as described in [4] using focused cod-\ning followed by thematic analysis. In the following, any per-\nsonal names of teachers/students that appear are pseudonyms.\n3. THEMES OF MUSICAL CONCEPT\nA high-school classroom context of course involves nego-\ntiation of various types of known and unknown concepts.\nOne can get a Ô¨Årst impression of the concepts that are dis-\ncussed in music lessons by looking at the curriculum speciÔ¨Å-\ncation.1However, such a document does not reveal how the\ndiscussions might play out in the actual classroom context:\nwhich concepts are more easily negotiated through which\nmodalities, how new ideas relate to prior knowledge, and\nany subtleties in the way teachers and students approach dif-\nferent concepts.\n3.1 Musical instruments are easy\nMusical instruments, familiar and unfamiliar, were the basis\nfor many discussions in the observations, but were found to\nbe amenable to negotiation through a wide range of strate-\ngies: by name, by comparing against other known instru-\nments, by describing physical characteristics, by miming,\nby showing pictures, or of course by having one in the room\nto show and/or use. The concreteness of instruments ‚Äì they\nare generally physical objects ‚Äì is of course a strong reason\nfor this, allowing access to discussion of instruments includ-\ning those from unfamiliar cultures. Indeed, the most difÔ¨Åcult\nnegotiation observed in relation to musical instrument was\nabout the more abstract idea of classiÔ¨Åcation into Western\norchestral sections, for example why an electric guitar is not\nincluded in the string section. Even here, the concepts‚Äô an-\nchoring in the concreteness of musical instruments makes\nthem amenable to negotiation.\nMusical notes were also relatively straightforward to ne-\ngotiate, by name (‚ÄúC sharp‚Äù) or number (‚Äúthird fret‚Äù or a\nnote‚Äôs number in a sequence), or by pointing at their position\non a keyboard or fretboard. This doesn‚Äôt mean notes were\neasy to recognise or memorise ‚Äì note the recurrent practice\nof using a felt-tip to mark the note-names on the keys of\nthe MIDI keyboard ‚Äì but that there were stable commonly-\nunderstood ways to refer to them. In our observations, West-\n1http://curriculum.qcda.gov.uk/\nkey-stages-3-and-4/subjects/key-stage-3/music/ ,\nhttp://www.edexcel.com/quals/gcse/gcse09/music/ern 12tet tuning was an unchallenged common ground for\nnote tunings, and we might conjecture that this supported\nthe ease of discussion; although the schools did include some\nnon-Western music in their curriculum, we did not observe\nany discussion going beyond the Western 12tet scale.\n3.2 Genre terms are contextual and useful\nGenre-type terms were observed in many conversations, used\nto navigate known and unknown music ‚Äì both in curriculum-\noriented conversation and more informal conversation about\nmusic that people like or dislike. In the MIR context this is\nnotable because genre has been a topic of some debate ‚Äì see\nSection 5 for further discussion.\nThe use of genre-type terms has an important role in\nmapping out a landscape of musical styles and exploring\nthat landscape. Note that the labels do not form a compact\nor mutually-exclusive set of categories (unlike the ‚Äúrecord\nshop‚Äù approach to genre); instead they function more like\nlandmarks, having particular traits which can be discussed\nand compared against other genres.\nThe following brief excerpt shows a function of genre in\na lesson, as one student shares music with a peer:\nPreston (American, recently new to the class) was sitting at\na computer in the corner of the room, next to Terry. He was\nlistening to something on earphones. He offered one earphone\nto Terry:\nPreston : Check this out\nTerry took the earphone and listened. Preston turned up the\nvolume loud so it was audible in the room. He nodded along\nto the slowish beat and looked around the room smiling with a\nsatisÔ¨Åed look.\nTerry : How dyou dance to this\n[Pause.]\nPreston : This is car music bro. You just ride\naround with a fucked-up ass car.\nThey carried on listening to the music.\nHere ‚Äúcar music‚Äù functions as a genre term, deÔ¨Åned through\na trait not of how it is made or its sonic aspects, but of what\nlisteners do with the music.\nThe excerpt concerns social music sharing rather than a\nclass task, yet the use of genre was consistent in many ob-\nservations. When genre labels are used in a task set by the\nteacher, they function as a route in to discussing and Ô¨Ånd-\ning out about different ways of performing and using music,\nand thus broadening students‚Äô awareness. The labels often\ndon‚Äôt appear as entirely new concepts, rather as references\nto musical styles including ones the students may only have\na vague awareness of. Thus an important role of genre terms\nhere appears to be to provide named landmarks to navigate\nthe world of known and unknown musics.\n34812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nNote also that there may be negotiation of musical genre\nterms ‚Äì the terms are not universal/objective, but local ne-\ngotiation is sometimes required to come to an agreed un-\nderstanding. Hence in one class task, the term ‚Äúbhangra‚Äù\nwas unfamiliar to some students, leading to a discussion re-\nsolving its meaning by reference to known terms such as\n‚ÄúIndian‚Äù and ‚ÄúBollywood‚Äù. Although such a comparison\nmight seem inaccurate to some bhangra/Bollywood fans, it\nhelped resolve the term ‚Äúbhangra‚Äù as a landmark useable in\nfurther group discussion.\n3.3 Nameless rhythms\nIn contrast to the genre talk just considered, negotiation of\nrhythm generally occurred without a stable set of labels or\nways to refer to different rhythms: rhythms generally were\nincluded in discussion only by acting them out ‚Äì whether on\na drum, by clapping, or vocally.\nActing out rhythms is an important part of music edu-\ncation, but discussion can be impeded if there is no shared\nset of common terms used as shorthand. (Musicologists do\nhave names for many rhythms, e.g. son clave ; and note du-\nrations can be named as e.g. quaver orquarter note , though\nthese don‚Äôt lead directly to shorthand names for rhythms.)\nIn our observations we found a general tendency for rhythm\ntalk to be limited by this lack of names, sometimes causing\nconfusion or difÔ¨Åculties in remembering which is which.\nThe closest to a stable terminology was the ‚Äúone and two\nand three and‚Äù approach used by some musicians, though\neven here there was ambiguity, in part because counting\ncan be done at different metrical rates, or the accents can\nbe counted rather than the underlying tactus. For example,\non one occasion a teacher talked this approach through out\nloud, saying ‚Äúone and two and three and four and‚Äù and ask-\ning the students, ‚Äúwhich number was the ‚Äòand‚Äô after?‚Äù How-\never he became unsure himself, miming playing the drums\nwhile saying ‚Äúone and two and‚Äù and then ‚Äúone and two and\nthree and‚Äù, and coming to the decision that the right answer\nwas three. This answer seemed not to affect subsequent use\nof the rhythm in class, since the rhythm pattern was subse-\nquently negotiated only by performing it, not by referring to\nany ‚Äòand‚Äôs or numbers.\n4. THEMES OF MODALITY\nHaving contrasted the uses of some different types of mu-\nsical concept in music lessons, we next turn to consider the\nmodalities used by teachers and students.\n4.1 Multimodality\nFrom our observations we found a strong pattern in the tech-\nnological and non-technological modes that teachers and\nstudents use to negotiate music-related concepts: they use awide variety of modes, both digital and otherwise, in quick\nsuccession and often in parallel. The classroom is a rich\nenvironment in which a wide variety of resource types can\nbe called upon instantly, without necessarily planning in ad-\nvance. To give an overview ‚Äì teachers and students:\n‚Ä¢talk about musical concepts verbally, using descrip-\ntions, counting, and references to known artists/musics;\n‚Ä¢they demonstrate concepts by acting them out using\nphysical instruments, voice, software sequencers, or\n(surprisingly often) mime;\n‚Ä¢they convey concepts by talking someone else through\nacting them out;\n‚Ä¢they call upon resources including posters, physical\ninstruments, smartphones/MP3 players, slideshows,\nWikipedia articles, Youtube videos, and web searches;\n‚Ä¢and they share speciÔ¨Åc music pieces by means of head-\nphones, earphones, loudspeakers, singing, and occa-\nsionally Ô¨Åle-transfer.\nThis list is an aggregation, but not an aggregation of dis-\nparate phases of activity: the prevailing behaviour of teach-\ners and students during music lessons involves using many\nof these in parallel, even when a task set for students might\nformally seem to revolve around one speciÔ¨Åc mode.\nOne example of a technology incorporated into the resource-\nrich classroom context is the Interactive Whiteboard (IW) ‚Äì\ni.e. a projector screen with a touch interface, and the abil-\nity to be written on with digital pens etc. In the UK there\nwas previously special funding for IWs in schools, and they\nwere present in all classrooms observed. However, there\nwas a very strong pattern in the use of IWs, which was\nthat they were heavily used as more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù projection\nscreens and rarely if ever for their touchscreen or digital-\npen capabilities. The projected screen was very often used\nby the teacher to project Powerpoint slides (of task instruc-\ntions, learning objectives, descriptions of musical concepts),\nto demonstrate software use (how to Ô¨Åll in a form, or use a\nmusic sequencer), and to play videos. Students were often\nallowed to control what was projected, e.g. in choosing a\nmusic video. It was rare for a classroom session not to in-\nvolve the projected screen: it often served as a focal point\n(e.g. when playing a video to the class), and also very often\nas a highly visible place to leave reference information, such\nas task instructions or a musical scale or chord progression.\nThe projected screen was very commonly used in conjunc-\ntion with other resources, such as playing back a video while\nstudents played along to it using instruments.\nThere are multiple potential explanations for why the IW‚Äôs\ninteractive features were not generally used. Teachers and\n349Oral Session 5: User Studies\nstudents both showed awareness of how to use those fea-\ntures, such as by tapping the screen to dismiss a screen-\nsaver; so lack of awareness was not a factor here. Rather it\nseems that the projected screen is easily incorporated along-\nside other activities such as playing an instrument or writing,\nwhile the IW-speciÔ¨Åc features make demands (such as being\nclose to the screen, and sometimes holding a special pen)\nwhich reduce their ease of integration into multimodal ac-\ntivities. Contrast this with Shannon and Cunnigham‚Äôs study\nin a class of young children with special needs, in which\nthe largest effect was said to be that IW placement and other\nfactors led to symbolic ‚Äúownership‚Äù of the IW by the teacher\n[7]. We did not observe such effects in our study, with stu-\ndents generally as comfortable as the teachers to make use\nof the IW, but both used its projected screen as part of mul-\ntimodal activities rather than using the interactive features.\n4.2 Youtube\nOne of the most-used technologies in the classes observed\nwas the youtube.com website. (There was some non-\nYoutube use of internet video, but to a very much smaller ex-\ntent.) Youtube‚Äôs breadth of coverage appears to be what sup-\nports its thorough integration into classroom practice: stu-\ndents and teachers often searched in Youtube without hav-\ning checked in advance they would Ô¨Ånd something relevant,\nand almost always found a video which satisÔ¨Åed them.\nYoutube was used by teachers and by students for many\npurposes, including:\n‚Ä¢playing a song to support a lesson topic (e.g. to demon-\nstrate a musical style);\n‚Ä¢playing documentaries about musical topics;\n‚Ä¢playing examples of live performance;\n‚Ä¢playing a track to work out its chords and/or instru-\nmentation;\n‚Ä¢playing a ‚Äúwith-lyrics‚Äù video of a track (showing ani-\nmated lyrics), to work out or sing along to the lyrics;\n‚Ä¢playing a track to perform along to (playing instru-\nments and/or dancing);\n‚Ä¢playing back old TV/radio adverts (to demonstrate the\nuse of music in them);\n‚Ä¢playing background music quietly;\n‚Ä¢Ô¨Ånding sound effects or soundtrack elements whose\naudio could be ripped and used;\n‚Ä¢and music sharing (playing liked music to others).There was a strong overlap between teachers‚Äô and students‚Äô\ninitiation of Youtube for these uses, and a strong overlap in\nwhether the projected screen or a student‚Äôs individual screen\nwas used for playback.\nContrary to the suggestions made by Webb [9], Youtube\nusage was generally not oriented around carefully-planned\nand -structured video-based activities, but as a resource ca-\nsually integrated into many multimodal activities. A re-\nsource treated in the same way was Wikipedia, a source\ncommonly turned to for factual and textual information (as\nwell as web searches more generally). Wikipedia shares\nwith Youtube the features of having a very broad coverage\nand text search, allowing teachers and students to use it at\nshort notice without having to consider in advance whether\nmaterial will be found.\n4.3 Singing\nSinging is used within music lessons, sometimes as the main\nfocus of an activity, sometimes brieÔ¨Çy to convey a melody\nor musical idea. However, the use of singing as a medium\nis not always straightforward: singing in UK culture can\nbe susceptible to embarrassment and concern with being\n‚Äúout of tune‚Äù, with speciÔ¨Åc inhibition at secondary school\nage [5]. In the following excerpt, in which students were\nplaying/singing along to Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄúClocks‚Äù on a with-\nlyrics Youtube video, we see how a reluctance to sing can\naffect the progress of a task which requires it:\nOn the screen, Amy had been searching the web and nav-\nigated to a webpage showing the lyrics to ‚ÄúClocks‚Äù. The\nYoutube video was still playing (in a background window or\ntab) but then it ended.\nJo to Amy/Donna : Are you guys ready to sing?\nDonna : [Pause.] No.\nAmy : We need Andrew.\nJo: I‚Äôll play it and you sing, we need to practice\nit.\nJo played the chords, but Amy/Donna seemed unwilling to\nsing. Corinne (the teacher) came back in.\nCorinne : Right has the music Ô¨Ånished?\nAmy : Yes\nCorinne : Right let‚Äôs have a run-through. Toby\nstart with the bass.\nToby : Me?\nAfter a pause, Toby started with the bass. Jo joined in on guitar.\nThen Amy/Donna sang but very quietly.\nCorinne : Right stop. Can you guys hear them\nsinging?\nJo: No\nToby [loudly] : No!\nCorinne negotiated with Amy and Donna to try and encourage\nthem to sing more loudly. Amy protested that ‚Äúwhen I sing\nloud it goes out of tune‚Äù. Corinne got the group to do another\nplaythrough, but Amy and Donna started singing then stopped,\nsaying they didn‚Äôt know where they were in the words.\n35012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nBeyond the end of this excerpt, the two students offered\nfurther reasons not to sing. The multiplicity of reasons given,\nwhether or not they were the main motivations for reluc-\ntance to sing, suggest that singing can in some contexts in-\nduce conÔ¨Ådence issues which instrument-playing generally\ndoes not.\nHowever singing is not always so inhibited. In some\nlessons, students would spontaneously sing together for fun\n(not connected with a class task). Sometimes the teacher\nwould co-opt this for a learning purpose, while sometimes\nit would continue separately from the class task.\n4.4 Exploration\nA theme that cuts across all modalities is that of student ex-\nploration. Most classroom activities are unbounded, with\nstudents engaged in exploratory and/or creative tasks. This\nis in part connected to the teaching strategies currently in\nuse; here we are concerned with the implications for tech-\nnology design.\nThe casual use of various modalities and resources is\npart of this tendency towards exploration. For example, the\nsearch and browsing features of Youtube, Wikipedia and\nweb search were often used to explore available informa-\ntion, beyond the basic satisfaction of a single search objec-\ntive. Exploration was also how students engaged with mu-\nsical instruments, trying out new possibilities (such as the\nvarious sounds available on a MIDI keyboard, or what hap-\npens when you shout into a saxophone).\nIt is worth noting that the authorised/unauthorised sta-\ntus of much student activity is ambiguous, in part because\nof this exploratory mode. Students‚Äô actions evolve quickly\nin interaction with many things around them (socially and\nphysically), and even if one particular action is authorised/-\nunauthorised by a teacher‚Äôs intervention, the students‚Äô ac-\ntivity very quickly moves beyond that speciÔ¨Åc action. Even\nactions which start out as speciÔ¨Åcally non-curricular (social\nor undirected) may be co-opted by the teacher.\nIt is evident that technologies which support broad ex-\nploratory activity are more likely to be generally useful, and\nthat the authorised/unauthorised status of activities can only\nbe determined in the particular context in negotiation be-\ntween teacher and students. There were occasions when\nexploratory activity caused problems for teachers ‚Äì such\nas when students spent more time formatting their Power-\npoint presentation than researching musical concepts for it\n‚Äì but teachers often encourage exploratory activity as part\nof lessons.\n4.5 Music sharing\nMusic sharing has been discussed in the literature most often\nin terms of social music sharing (e.g. [3]), but of course mu-\nsic lessons are a context in which people share well-knownand unfamiliar music with each other. For this reason, and\nalso because we observed non-curricular instances of mu-\nsic sharing in the classroom context, the various modes and\nmeanings of music sharing in music education emerged as a\nrecurrent theme in our analysis.\nIn the age of the Internet, developments in the music in-\ndustry have led to the idea of ‚Äúmusic sharing‚Äù becoming as-\nsociated with digital circulation of music recordings. In our\nstudy, students did occasionally share music with each other\nor with teachers by sending Ô¨Åles electronically, but more\noften they might share their earphones to share what they\nare listening to, or sing a melody out loud, or tell someone\nhow to search for a particular artist online. We observed\nmany instances of music sharing, with the most common\nmodes being sharing headphones/earphones, playing tracks\nout loud, and singing. As noted in the previous discussion, it\nis often unclear whether speciÔ¨Åc instances of music sharing\nare authorised or unauthorised in a particular music lesson,\nand there can be conversion between the two: teachers often\nmake use of music that students like, to enhance engagement\nand to connect musical concepts to familiar music.\nIn our observations, the vast majority of students had mo-\nbile phones/MP3 players and earphones with them, so mu-\nsic sharing by sharing earphones could and did happen quite\noften. Although we were studying the music lesson context\nand not the students‚Äô lives more generally, the casual avail-\nability of speakers, earphones and singing seemed to make\nthem the preferred form of music sharing, rather than digital\nmeans. Compare this with Laplante‚Äôs study [6] which em-\nphasises the importance of young people‚Äôs social networks\n(both strong and weak ties) in music discovery, though La-\nplante does not directly explore which modalities are used\nseparating out different possible modes of music sharing.\n5. DISCUSSION\n5.1 Genre and labels\nGenre has been the subject of debate in the MIR community,\nfrom foundational genre classiÔ¨Åcation experiments [8] to\nmore recent discussions problematising the ‚Äúrecord-shop‚Äù\nmodel of genre and moving towards more multi-facteted ap-\nproaches such as social tagging [1] ‚Äì or towards the aban-\ndonment of genre labels in favour of music similarity met-\nrics. The outcomes from this study suggest that the aban-\ndonment of genre-type labels would be a mistake, as such la-\nbels function as useful landmarks in the negotiation of both\nfamiliar and unfamiliar musics. The comparison against\nrhythm talk is illustrative: the lack of stable labels for rhythms\ncan make discussion unwieldy. (MIR tools to help under-\nstand rhythm might help address this, and/or perhaps the\nuse of speciÔ¨Åc rhythm labels in teaching.)\nIn this respect the work of Craft [2] accords well with\nour observations. Craft argues that genre is not an inherent\n351Oral Session 5: User Studies\nattribute of a track, but a label that emerges from a person‚Äôs\ninteraction with it and with their context: ‚Äúmeanings of mu-\nsic, such as the categories into which an individual puts mu-\nsic, are emergent qualities of the music when given social\ncontextualization, rather than merely objective attributes of\nit‚Äù (p. 167). Further, he argues that a situated approach to\ngenre is nevertheless amenable to analysis by MIR tools.\nOur research supports this position and suggests that such\nan approach would be more likely to make such analyses\nuseful to real-world contexts such as school music lessons.\n5.2 Designing for multimodality and exploration\nOur study found that teachers and students predominantly\nengaged in highly multimodal activities during music lessons.\nTeachers and students use a variety of technologies casu-\nally, often in parallel/combination and without prior plan-\nning. Also, most student activity is exploratory in nature,\ndue to both the tasks set by teachers and the students‚Äô inter-\nactions with their environment. Technologies designed for\nthe classroom must Ô¨Åt with these modes of use: they must be\namenable to use in combination with other resources/tech-\nnologies, at short notice, and ideally facilitate exploration\nacross a wide range of potential topics. They should not be\ndesigned as if they will be the focus of uninterrupted atten-\ntion for long periods, but function as part of the rich class-\nroom environment, often lying latent until needed.\nDiscussion of technology and education often focuses on\nthe high-tech, but the combination of high- and low-tech\nmust be remembered. Physical musical instruments are of\ncourse used in music lessons for various purposes, but also\nsinging, mime and posters are called upon as part of negoti-\nating musical ideas. On one speciÔ¨Åc topic, we note the issue\nof students‚Äô potential anxiety when asked to sing, at least in\nthe UK context, while singing is an activity that music teach-\ners often want to encourage and develop. Any MIR system\nthat worked with the singing modality (such as query-by-\nsinging/humming, singing transcription) would need to be\ndesigned with sensitivity to such issues.\nReturning to the idea of open-ended exploration, it may\nbe a challenge to build a system with a breadth of coverage\non the order of that of Youtube or Wikipedia. One solution\nmight be to piggyback on larger systems such as Youtube\n(for example, offfering an MIR analysis of Youtube videos\non demand). Alternatively, linked data and the semantic web\noffer the potential to connect up with myriad large music-\nrelated resources, so might provide the infrastructure for a\nuseful resource.\n6.

However, the available OMR systems lack the ability to recognize transposition information contained in complex orchestral scores. 1 An additional unsolved OMR problem is the handling of orchestral scores using compressed notation. 2 Here, the information of which instrument has to play which staff is crucial for a correct interpretation of the score. But this mapping is lost along the pages of the score during the OMR process. In this paper, we present a method for retrieving the instrumentation and transposition information of orchestral scores. In our approach, we combine the results of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and OMR to regain the information available through text annotations of the score. In addition, a method to reconstruct the instrument and transposition information for staves where text annotations were omitted or not recognized is presented. In an evaluation we analyze the impact of transposition information on the quality of score-audio synchronizations of orchestral music. The results show that the knowledge of transposing instruments improves the synchronization accuracy and that our method helps in regaining this knowledge.",

However, the available OMR systems lack the ability\nto recognize transposition information contained in complex\norchestral scores.1An additional unsolved OMR problem\nis the handling of orchestral scores using compressed no-\ntation.2Here, the information of which instrument has to\nplay which staff is crucial for a correct interpretation of the\nscore. But this mapping is lost along the pages of the score\nduring the OMR process. In this paper, we present a method\nfor retrieving the instrumentation and transposition informa-\ntion of orchestral scores. In our approach, we combine the\nresults of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and OMR\nto regain the information available through text annotations\nof the score. In addition, a method to reconstruct the in-\nstrument and transposition information for staves where text\nannotations were omitted or not recognized is presented. In\nan evaluation we analyze the impact of transposition infor-\nmation on the quality of score-audio synchronizations of\norchestral music. The results show that the knowledge of\ntransposing instruments improves the synchronization accu-\nracy and that our method helps in regaining this knowledge.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nA conductor reading an orchestral score can easily recog-\nnize which instrument is notated in which staff of a system.\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the German Research Foun-\ndation DFG. This work has been supported by the P ROBADO project (grant\nCL 64/7-2) and the A RMADA project (grant CL 64/6-2).\n1For transposing instruments the written notes are several semitones\nhigher/lower than the sounding notes.\n2In our context, the notion of compressed score is used to describe a\nscore, where after the Ô¨Årst system staves of instruments not playing are\ntemporarily removed from a system.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.For this to be possible, a set of common conventions of type-\nsetting scores was developed. Examples are the introduction\nof all instruments playing in a piece of music by labeling the\nstaves of the Ô¨Årst system, a Ô¨Åxed instrument order or the us-\nage of braces and accolades to cluster instruments [12]. In\ncase of compressed scores, in addition to the labeling of the\nÔ¨Årst system, subsequent systems are annotated with instru-\nment text labels as well (see Figure 1). However, these are\ntypically annotated by abbreviations instead of full instru-\nment names. In several scores, labels are omitted when a\nsystem does not differ structurally from the preceding sys-\ntem.\n..................\nFigure 1 .Extracts from Franz Liszt: Eine Sinfonie nach Dantes\nDivina Commedia using compressed notation (Publisher: Breit-\nkopf & H ¬®artel ).\nThe PROBADO project3aims at developing a digital li-\nbrary system offering new presentation methods for large\ncollections of music documents (i.e., scans of sheet music\nand digitized music CDs). Similar to a conductor following\nthe score while listening to a performance, the PROBADO\nsystem highlights the measure in the score matching the cur-\nrently audible part of an audio track. One prerequisite for\nthis type of presentation is a mapping/synchronization of\npixel areas in the score scans to time intervals in the au-\ndio track (see Section 3). The Ô¨Årst step in calculating this\nmapping is the reconstruction of the musical information\ncontained in the score scans using OMR.4However, for\norchestral scores the existing OMR systems lack the abil-\nity to reconstruct all information given in the score. Or-\nchestral scores contain instrumentation information which\n3http://www.probado.de\n4We apply SharpEye2 (http://www.visiv.co.uk )\n411Poster Session 3\nmight be important, e.g., for extracting the score of a sin-\ngle instrument. In addition, the instrument text labels also\nmark transposing instruments in the score. Their ignorance\nresults in shifts of single voices with respect to the rest of\nthe voices in the score. In [14] the impact of typical OMR\nerrors on the results of score-audio synchronizations was an-\nalyzed. It turned out that lacking transposition information\nhas to be classiÔ¨Åed as the most inÔ¨Çuential OMR error. This\nsuggests that the transposition information contained in the\nscore should be reconstructed. Unfortunately, at the cur-\nrent state no OMR system known to us offers the extraction\nof transposition information as well as a correct instrument\nlabeling5of the score. SharpEye provides some text recog-\nnition. However, the recognitions are not analyzed with re-\nspect to instrument names and are not mapped to the ac-\ncording staves, let alone propagated to the following (un-\nlabeled) systems. The OMR system PhotoScore Ultimate\n66offers instrument labeling to some extent. The included\nOCR engine recognizes the instrument texts (often includ-\ning transpositions) and maps them to the staves. In addi-\ntion, the recognized instrument text labels from the Ô¨Årst sys-\ntem are propagated to the following systems. However, the\nused method seems to be rather simple. PhotoScore maps\nthe instrument text labels extracted from the Ô¨Årst system to\nthe following systems line by line. Unfortunately, text la-\nbels from these systems and structural differences in case of\ncompressed scores are ignored. Therefore, particularly for\ncompressed scores, incorrect instrument labelings are cre-\nated. Another OMR system dealing with instrument labels\niscapella-scan .7The observed abilities of capella-scan to\ncreate and propagate instrument and transposition labels are\ncomparable to those of PhotoScore . In both OMR systems,\nthe recognized transposition text labels‚Äîeven if correctly\nrecognized‚Äîdo not seem to be transformed into transposi-\ntion labels that are considered during the creation of a sym-\nbolic representation, such as MIDI or MusicXML.\nIn OMR research two crucial questions exist: Firstly,\nwhich music format is processed? Each format (e.g., hand-\nwritten score, medieval score) calls for specialized recon-\nstruction methods. Secondly, what is the application sce-\nnario? The intended application strongly inÔ¨Çuences the re-\nquired OMR accuracy. On the one hand, there are situa-\ntions where an exact reconstruction of the score is crucial.\nIn this context, OMR systems that allow for manual cor-\nrections of the recognition results were proposed (e.g., [5]).\nLearning mechanisms integrated into those systems then use\nthe user feedback to gradually improve the OMR accuracy.\nOn the other hand, some applications demand OMR pro-\n5In contrast to the text actually placed on the score‚Äîwhich we call\ninstrument text label ‚Äîinstrument labels are language independent. All\nknown abbreviations or names of the same instrument are mapped to the\nsame label. These labels are used to identify which instrument is meant to\nplay in a staff.\n6http://www.sibelius.com/products/photoscore/\nultimate.html\n7http://www.whc.de/capella-scan.cfmcesses providing a sufÔ¨Åcient quality without requiring user\ninteractions. In our scenario, we are interested in process-\ning a large data collection with as little user interaction as\npossible. The generated OMR results are only required for\nscore-audio synchronization, which is robust with respect to\nmissing notes and incorrect note durations. Therefore, in\nthis situation accuracy loss in favor of automation is desir-\nable.\nAlthough a great deal of research on OMR has been con-\nducted (see, e.g., [1]), the special challenges of orchestral\nscores have not yet been addressed. However, the extrac-\ntion of instrumentation and transposition information has to\nbe considered a crucial part of OMR for orchestral scores\nregardless of whether the goal is an exact digital reconstruc-\ntion of the score (e.g., for score-informed voice separation)\nor a rough representation intended for further processing.\nIn this contribution we present a method to reconstruct\nthe missing instrument and transposition labels in orches-\ntral scores. We combine OCR and OMR to regain informa-\ntion from text labels in the score. Subsequently, instrument\nand transposition labels for staves lacking text annotations\nare reconstructed using music-related constraints and prop-\nerties.\nIn Section 2 we will describe our instrument and trans-\nposition label reconstruction method. In Section 3 we will\ngive a short description of the applied score-audio synchro-\nnization technique. Afterwards, the results of our evaluation\nusing a set of 11 orchestral pieces are presented and dis-\ncussed. We close this paper with a summary and an outlook\non possible future work in Section 4.\n2. METHOD\nWe present our method to reconstruct the instrument and\ntransposition labels in staves of orchestral scores. Basically,\nthe algorithm can be subdivided into three parts: In the Ô¨Årst\npart of the process (Subsection 2.1) the text areas on the\nscore scans are identiÔ¨Åed and processed by an OCR soft-\nware. Subsequently, the recognition results are transformed\ninto instrument labels and matched to the corresponding\nstaves. After this step, all staves, where textual informa-\ntion was given in the score and recognized by the OCR soft-\nware, possess an instrument label. But in orchestral scores,\nafter the Ô¨Årst system, instrument text labels are often omit-\nted. Therefore, in the second step of the algorithm (Sub-\nsection 2.2) missing labels are reconstructed by propagating\nexisting labels. Afterwards, each staff has an instrument la-\nbel associated with it. In the Ô¨Ånal step of the algorithm the\ntransposition labels that were found in the Ô¨Årst system are\npropagated through the score (Subsection 2.3).\nWe impose some assumptions on the scores processed\nwith our method:\n‚Ä¢The Ô¨Årst system contains all instrument names that occur\nin the piece.\n41212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n‚Ä¢The instrument order established in the Ô¨Årst system is not\nchanged in subsequent systems.\n‚Ä¢A maximum of two staves share a common instrument\ntext label.\n‚Ä¢When Ô¨Årst introduced, full instrument names are used.\n‚Ä¢For compressed scores, text labels are given if the instru-\nmentation changed compared to the preceding system.\nFor most orchestral scores these assumptions are met.\nWe will now provide a detailed account of the three steps\nof the instrument and transposition labeling algorithm. For\nan even more extensive description we refer to [15].\n2.1 OCR-based instrument labeling\nIn this part of the reconstruction, we analyze textual infor-\nmation given on the score sheets to create instrument and\ntransposition labels.\nFirst, given a scanned score image, the contained con-\nnected components (CCs) of black pixels are determined\n[11, 15]. Afterwards, CCs that deÔ¨Ånitely do not contain let-\nters are discarded. Using a sweep line algorithm [3] hori-\nzontally neighboring CCs are then merged to form words.\nSubsequently, the thereby determined image areas are used\nas input for the ABBYY FineReader 10 OCR software.8\nAt this point, we have a list of OCR recognitions and\ntheir positions on the score scans. To achieve a proper in-\nstrument labeling two additional steps are required. First,\nthe recognized text is compared to an instrument library.\nThe library contains names and abbreviations for typical or-\nchestral instruments in German, English, French, and Ital-\nian. Using the Levenshtein distance [8], the library entries\nwith the longest word count that are the most similar to the\nrecognitions are identiÔ¨Åed and used as instrument labels in\nthe according text areas. Secondly, using the staff position\ninformation available in SharpEye , the identiÔ¨Åed instrument\nlabels are mapped to the according staves of the score.\nIn the majority of cases, transposition information is\navailable from text labels like ‚Äúclarinet in A‚Äù (see Figure 2).\nTo detect transpositions we therefore search for occurrences\nof text labels containing the keyword ‚Äúin‚Äù followed by a\nvalid transposition.\n2.2 Instrument label reconstruction\nThis section constitutes the main part of the proposed meth-\nod. We will use the labeling from the previous section as\ninitialization of an iterative process to reconstruct the label-\ning for all staves. Given the score of a piece of music, we\ndeÔ¨Åne the sequence of all systems M= (M0,...,M m)and\nthe set of all instrument labels Iof systemM0that were re-\nconstructed in Section 2.1. With S= [1:N]we enumerate\nall the staves in Mand letSa‚äÇSdenote the staff num-\nbers corresponding to Ma. Furthermore, we create a ma-\n8http://finereader.abbyy.comtrixœÄ‚àà[0,1]S√óI, whereœÄ(i,I)will be interpreted as the\n‚Äúplausibility‚Äù of staff ihaving the instrument label I. The\nsubmatrixœÄa‚àà[0,1]Sa√óIcorresponds to Ma. We initial-\nizeœÄwith the instrument labels determined in Section 2.1.\nAs plausibility values, the Levenshtein distances between\nthe instrument labels and the original instrument text on the\nscore sheets are applied. Note that due to this initialization,\nseveral instruments might be mapped to one staff (e.g., for\nthe text label ‚Äúviola and violoncello‚Äù). Afterwards, the plau-\nsibility matrix œÄ0:=œÄis iteratively updated using an update\nmethod that can be subdivided into three steps\nœÄk+1=IOC‚ó¶IP‚ó¶POP (œÄk).\nWe will now explain these three steps of the update process\nin chronological order.\n2.2.1 Propagation of plausibilities (POP)\nIn this step we will propagate the plausibilities from system\nMato systemMb, for several a < b speciÔ¨Åed below. To\nperform a plausibility propagation, we Ô¨Åst calculate the set\nCa,b‚â°Ca,b(œÄa,œÄb)consisting of all triples (i,j,I )‚ààSa√ó\nSb√óIwhose joint plausibility œÄa(i,I)¬∑œÄb(j,I)is positive.\nWe then reduce Ca,bby removing all crossings. A crossing\nbetween two triples (i,j,I )and(k,/lscript,K )withi<k occurs\nifj > /lscript . In case of a crossing, the triple with smaller joint\nplausibility is removed. The resulting set will be denoted\nbyC/prime\na,b. By projecting the elements of C/prime\na,bonto the Ô¨Årst\ntwo components, (i,j,I )/mapsto‚Üí(i,j), we end up with the set\nC√ó\na,b‚â°C√ó\na,b(œÄa,œÄb). To deal with uninitialized systems and\nfull scores, we add the pairs (0,0)and(|Sa|+1,|Sb|+1) to\nC√ó\na,b. After sorting C√ó\na,blexicographically, we perform the\nfollowing update process ‚Üë(œÄb|œÄa)forœÄbgivenœÄa:\n1. For the smallest element (i,j)‚ààC√ó\na,bsearch the minimal\nt‚â•1such that (i+t,j+t)‚ààC√ó\na,b.\n2. If no such texists, goto 5.\n3.

For all (/lscript,I)‚ààSb√óIupdateœÄbas follows:\nœÄb(/lscript,I) = max ({œÄb(/lscript,I)}‚à™{œÄa(k,I)|(k,/lscript)‚ààPij}).\n5. UpdateC√ó\na,bby removing (i,j).\n6. If|C√ó\na,b|>1, goto 1.\nUsing this local update instruction, we deÔ¨Åne POP (œÄk)\nin two steps. First we calculate /tildewideœÄk\nb:=‚Üë(œÄk\nb|œÄk\n0)for all\nb‚àà[1:m]and thenPOP (œÄk\nb) :=‚Üë(/tildewideœÄk\nb|POP (œÄk\nb‚àí1))is\nrecursively computed. We redeÔ¨Åne œÄk:=POP (œÄk).\n2.2.2 Applying instrument properties (IP)\nIn this step, we extract knowledge from the plausibility ma-\ntrix to reconstruct missing instrument labels and to fortify\nalready existing plausibility entries. We deÔ¨Åne some staff-\nrelated properties E1,...,E pas subsets of Swherei‚ààEj\n413Poster Session 3\nmeans that staff ihas property Ej(e.g., staffihas treble clef\nor staffiis the Ô¨Årst/last staff in the system). Similarly, we\ndeÔ¨Åne properties F1,...,F q‚äÇ‚à™m\na=0Sa√óSabetween two\nstaves of the same system (e.g., staff iis in the same brace\nas staffj). We now use these staff related properties and œÄ\nto deduce instrument related properties.\nFor each instrument Iwe calculate the probability distri-\nbutionPIonE:={E1,...,E p}givenœÄ:\nPI(E|œÄ) =/summationtext\ni‚ààEwi¬∑œÄ(i,I)/summationtext\nE/prime‚ààE/summationtext\ni‚ààE/primewi¬∑œÄ(i,I),\nwherewi=3\n4for stavesiinS0andwi=1\n4otherwise.

Using œÄ‚àÜ, we\ndeÔ¨ÅneIP(œÄk) := N(œÄk+œÄk\n‚àÜ), where for a non-zero matrix\nX,N(X) :=X/maxij|xij|. We redeÔ¨Åne œÄk:=IP(œÄk).\n2.2.3 Exploiting the instrument order constraint (IOC)\nA common convention for score notation is that the instru-\nment order established in the Ô¨Årst system is not altered in\nsubsequent systems. Therefore, we use the instrument la-\nbels ofS0to penalize systems where the instrument order\nestablished by S0is violated.\nGivenM0and a system Ma,a > 0, we extract the se-\nquencesI0= (I1,...,I|S0|)andIa= (J1,...,J|Sa|)of\nmost plausible instrument labels. Afterwards we calculate\nthe setL0aof all pairs (i,j)‚ààS0√óSawithIi=Jj\nfor which a pair (k,/lscript)‚ààS0√óSaexists withIk=J/lscript\nsuch that (i,j,I i)and(k,/lscript,I k)constitute a crossing (Sub-\nsection 2.2.1). The plausibility decrease œÄ‚àá,a(j,Jj) :=\nŒª/summationtext\ni:(i,j)‚ààL0aœÄa(i,Ii)with suitable parameter Œª > 0is\ncalculated for all a‚àà[1:m]. Finally, the plausibility\nupdate using the instrument order constraint is given by\nIOC (œÄk) := N(œÄk‚àíœÄk\n‚àá), whereœÄk\n‚àá=/parenleftbig\nœÄk\n‚àá,0,...,œÄk\n‚àá,m/parenrightbig\n.\n2.3 Transposition propagation\nDuring the OCR-based reconstruction of the instrument la-\nbels, the available transposition information is also trans-\nformed into transposition labels and subsequently mapped\n9We chose two different probability distributions to account for the dif-\nferences between the two sets of properties EandF.to the according staves. After the reconstruction process de-\nscribed in the previous subsection has terminated, the trans-\nposition labels from the Ô¨Årst system are propagated through\nthe whole score. For each staff in S0holding a transposition\nlabel, the occurrences of its instrument label in the rest of\nthe score are determined. The concerned staves will then be\nassigned with the transposition label from S0.\nIn the context of our evaluation in Section 3 we used this\nmethod to propagate manually corrected transposition labels\nin the Ô¨Årst system to the whole score.\nWe are aware of the fact that some orchestral scores con-\ntain transposition information next to arbitrary staves. How-\never, extracting those short text labels (e.g., ‚Äúin A‚Äù) is a new\nchallenge and is left to be analyzed.\n3. EVALUATION\nAs the need for an algorithm that reconstructs the transposi-\ntion information contained in musical notations arose from\nour application scenario, we will evaluate the impact of our\nmethod with respect to the task of score-audio synchroniza-\ntion. In Subsection 3.1 we provide a short overview of the\ntechnique of score-audio synchronization. Afterwards, we\ngive a detailed account on the performed evaluations (Sub-\nsection 3.2).\n3.1 Score-audio synchronization\nThe goal of music synchronization in general is the calcu-\nlation of a mapping between each position in one represen-\ntation of a piece of music to the musically matching posi-\ntion in another representation of the same piece of music.\nFor score-audio synchronization tasks the given input docu-\nments are score scans and audio tracks.\nIn the Ô¨Årst step of the synchronization both music docu-\nments are transformed into a common representation which\nthen allows for a direct comparison. We chose to use the\nwell-established chroma-based features. For details on the\ncalculation of chroma features from audio recordings we re-\nfer to [2,9]. To extract chroma features from score scans the\ngiven sheets are Ô¨Årst analyzed with an OMR system to re-\nconstruct the musical information. After storing the recogni-\ntion results in a MIDI Ô¨Åle, the chroma features are calculated\nsimilarly as for the audio recordings.\nIn the next step a similarity matrix is calculated from the\ntwo feature sequences. Finally, by applying multiscale dy-\nnamic time warping [10, 13] a minimal path through this\nmatrix is calculated. The synchronization between the mu-\nsic documents is then encoded by this path.\n3.2 Experiments\nFor our evaluation, we employ the beat annotations from the\nRWC Music Library [6] as ground truth. We extracted the\nmeasure starting points from these Ô¨Åles to generate a ref-\nerence synchronization on the measure level. As test data\n41412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwe selected the 11 orchestral pieces which contain at least\none transposing instrument (see Table 1). In addition, the re-\nspective orchestral scores were collected and processed with\nSharpEye (data sources: IMSLP10and Bavarian State Li-\nbrary11). For four of the pieces we found scores that use a\ncompressed notation. Obviously, the labeling task is harder\nfor those scores than for scores using a full notation. To\nperform the synchronization experiments, we took audio\nexcerpts of roughly two minutes length and the according\nscore clippings.\nLabel Work Publisher\nC1 Haydn: Symphony no. 94 in G major, 1st mvmt.

For our test data there were\na total of 464instrument text labels given in the score. In\naddition, 87transposition text labels were found. Our eval-\nuation method could correctly reconstruct 88% of the instru-\nment and 77% of the transposition labels (see Table 2).

For\nthe remaining pieces, other than C1 and F4, the method im-\nproved the synchronization results compared to not apply-\ning any post-processing. By annotating the transposition la-\nbels in the Ô¨Årst system manually before propagating them\nthrough the score (OMR+LR‚àó) the results became equal to\nOMR‚àófor all full scores and the compressed score C1. Al-\nthough, manual interaction was still required, only annotat-\ning the Ô¨Årst system constitutes a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement\ncompared to annotating all systems of an orchestral piece\nmanually. For C2 and C3 a correct reconstruction of the\ntransposition labels was not possible. In addition, using the\npropagation of the transposition labels from the Ô¨Årst system\nresults in a degradation of the synchronization compared to\nOMR+LR (due to instrument labeling errors).\nWe will now discuss the labeling results for some scores\nin more detail. For two pieces the transposition text labels\ngiven in the score were not recognized. In C1 the score no-\ntation uses an unusual setting of the transposition text labels\n(see Figure 2). The text labeling in C1 results in the recog-\nnition of three separate text labels (‚Äúin‚Äù, ‚ÄúG‚Äùand ‚ÄúSol‚Äù) in-\nstead of one text label (e.g., ‚Äúin G‚Äù). Therefore, our method\ncould not reconstruct the transposition labeling. In F4 the\nalignment of the transposition text labels would allow for\na successful recognition but the OCR engine produced re-\nsults such as ‚Äúi n Sol‚Äù or ‚ÄúinSiw‚Äù. In both of these examples\nthe keyword ‚Äúin‚Äù with a subsequent space was not available.\nAlthough for all other pieces the transposition labels in the\nÔ¨Årst system were correct, some instrument labeling errors\noccurred which sometimes inÔ¨Çuenced the transposition la-\nbeling of subsequent systems in a negative manner. Some\nof these errors result from incorrect OCR recognitions (e.g.,\nrecognition of ‚ÄúFI.‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúFl.‚Äù (Ô¨Çute) results in a map-\n415Poster Session 3\nping to ‚ÄúFg.‚Äù (Fagott, German for bassoon)). Furthermore,\nsome text labels are wrongly interpreted as instrument text\nlabels and thereby produce wrong instrument labels. An in-\nteresting mix-up occurred for C3. Here, Italian text labels\nare used and both the clarinet and the trumpet are part of the\ninstrumentation. However, in Italian the trumpet is called\n‚Äúclarino‚Äù which is abbreviated by ‚ÄúCl.‚Äù. But, in English this\nabbreviation is used for the clarinet.\nFigure 2 .Examples of missed transposition text labels.\nWe also performed an evaluation of the impact of other\nOMR errors (clefs, accidentals, pitches, durations) on the\nprospective synchronization results (see Table 4). In accor-\ndance with the results in [14], correcting the OMR data al-\nmost consistently resulted in an improvement. However, the\naccuracy increase is less pronounced than for transpositions.\nLabel OMR OMR‚àóOMR+LR OMR+LR‚àó\nmean std mean std mean std mean std\nC4 1018 967 936 856 936 856 936 856\nAv 486 517 426 405 436 449 445 457\nF1 342 528 151 169 172 219 151 169\nAv 269 471 131 144 134 151 131 144\nTable 4 .Synchronization results for corrected OMR data.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nWe presented a method for the reconstruction of instrument\nand transposition labels from orchestral scores. Our method\nreconstructs instrument labels based on an OCR recognition\nand propagates those labels to staves where no instrument\ntext labels existed in the score. We tested our method in\nthe context of score-audio synchronization. The evaluation\nshowed both the need for the reconstruction of transposition\nlabels to improve the synchronization results and the ability\nof our method to achieve this.\nAt the moment our method is being integrated into the\npreprocessing workÔ¨Çow of the PROBADO application (see\n[4]). We hope to thereby reduce the manual annotation effort\nrequired to administer large music databases.\nTo make the reconstruction more robust‚Äîespecially for\ncompressed scores and with respect to the imposed assump-\ntions‚Äîwe suggest several ideas. We found that although\nABBYY FineReader produces a very high recognition rate\nfor words (>97%), the recognition of instrument abbre-\nviations was often inferior to other OCR engines. There-\nfore, a promising idea is the combination of several OCR\nengines to make the initial OCR-based instrument labelingmore reliable. Our method takes advantage of some con-\nventions for music notation while currently ignoring several\nothers. We assume that, e.g., key signatures, braces, and\ninstrument groups form powerful tools w.r.t. the task of in-\nstrument labeling. However, SharpEye does not recognize\nthose features reliably and prevents their reasonable usage.\nWe therefore suggest to reconstruct them by, e.g., combining\nseveral OMR engines as proposed in [7] and to subsequently\nintegrate them into the proposed method.\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic source separation has been a very important topic of\nresearch with applications in transcription [1], audio cod -\ning [2], enhancement [3] and personalization [4]. Source\nseparation involvesseparatinga polyphonicmono or stereo\nmusic into its component instrument streams. As a prelim-\ninary step towards source separation, decomposition of the\nmusic signal into separate harmonic and percussive instru-\nment streams has been a popular approach in recent years.\nThe percussive instrument stream can be used for drums\ntranscription [5], rhythm analysis [6], audio remixing [3]\namong the many applications. It has been shown that the\npercussion stream results in better drum transcription [5, 7]\nthan the original music itself. Likewise, the harmonic in-\nstruments stream can be used for multipitch estimation [1],\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage an d that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.pitchmodiÔ¨Åcation[4],notetranscriptionandleadvocalse x-\ntraction[8]with greaterease.\nMcAulay et al. [9] Ô¨Årst used sinusoidal modeling to de-\ncomposeasignalintoharmonicandnoisecomponentspop-\nularly known as the ‚Äúsine+noise‚Äú model. Verma et al. [10]\nintroduced the idea of modeling transients in a signal lead-\ning to the development of ‚Äùsine+transients+noise‚Äù model.\nVarious improvementsto these models have been proposed\nin [11,12]. Gillet et al. [7] used noise subspace projection s\nto split polyphonic music into harmonic and noise compo-\nnents with the noise components predominantlyhaving the\npercussive instruments. he noise signal was used for drum\ntranscription and was found to be more effective than the\noriginal for the same task. Yoshii et al. [5] used a template\nbased approachfor harmonicinstrument suppression to ex-\ntractdrumssoundsfrompolyphonicmusicfortranscription .\nRecently Ono et al. [3,13] presented an iterative algorithm\nusing spectrogram diffusion to split music signals into the\ncomponent harmonic and percussion streams. The percus-\nsion streams were used for remixing and equalisation pur-\nposes. Fitzgerald [14] proposed a much simpler alternative\nto Ono‚ÄôsalgorithmusingmedianÔ¨Åltering.\nBut most ofthe abovediscussed algorithmsare aimedat\nWestern music andspeciÔ¨Åcallypopmusic whichhasstrong\npercussion accompaniments. These algorithms do not per-\nformwellforIndianmusicwhichhassomewhatmutedper-\ncussion (often used just to give a basic beat to the lead in-\nstrument/vocalist) and an increased amount of vibratos in\nthe instrumental sections. This leads to a lot of leakages of\npercussionintotheharmonicstreamandviceversa.\nIn thispaperwe developa postprocessingtechniquethat\ncan applied to the output of Ono‚Äôs algorithm (called the\nbaseline from here onwards) [3,13] mentioned above.

ONO'SALGORITHMAND SHORTCOMINGS\nThespectrogramdiffusionbasedharmonic/percussionsepa -\nrationalgorithmproposedbyOnoetal.[3,13]assumesthat\nsteady harmonic instruments show up as horizontal lines\nwhilepercussiveinstrumentsshowupasverticallinesinth e\nsignal spectrogram. This is because of the steady nature\nof harmonic instruments that play enduring discrete notes\nwhile percussive instruments have a short time burst of en-\nergy leading to a wideband spectral structure as shown in\nFigure 1. The diffusion algorithm uses a minimization of\nthe spectrogram‚Äôs vertical and horizontal derivatives usi ng\nanauxiliaryfunctionapproach.\nLetx[n]be a monaural polyphonic music signal sam-\npled at 16kHz. Let X(i,j)denote its STFT (Short Time\nFourier Transform) at the ithfrequency bin and jthframe.\nLetW(i,j)be the range compressed version of the power\nspectrogramgivenby,\nW(i,j) =|X(i,j)|2Œ≥, (1)\nwhereŒ≥= 0.3.\nSimilarlylet H(i,j)andP(i,j)representthepowerspec-\ntrograms of the component harmonic and percussion sig-\nnals.\nAcostfunction J(H,P)deÔ¨Ånedasbelowisusedtomin-\nimizethe gradientsofthespectrograms.\nJ(H,P) =1\nœÉ2\nH/summationdisplay\ni,j(H(i,j)‚àíH(i,j‚àí1))2\n+1\nœÉ2\nP/summationdisplay\ni,j(P(i,j)‚àíP(i‚àí1,j))2.(2)\nThen, we wish to Ô¨Ånd HandPthat minimize the equa-\ntion(2)undertheconstraint,W=P+H. (3)\nAn iterative update method using auxiliary function ap-\nproach is used for the minimization of equation (2). This\nleads to the decomposition of the signal x[n]into its com-\nponentpercussionandharmonicspectrograms PandHre-\nspectively for various values of the diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±\n(0< Œ± <1).PandHare ‚Äúbinarized‚Äúto PbinandHbinas\ninequations(4,5)toattentuatetheinterferenceofharmon ic\ninstrumentsin thepercussivestreamandviceversa.\nPbin(i,j) =/braceleftbiggX(i,j)ifP(i,j)> H(i,j),\n0 ifP(i,j)‚â§H(i,j).(4)\nHbin(i,j) =X(i,j)‚àíPbin(i,j).

The percussive and harmonic streams p[n]andh[n]\nare reconstructedby invertingthe STFTs PbinandHbinre-\nspectivelyusingthephaseoftheoriginalsignal x[n](ateach\nframeduringinversion).\nOne of the shortcomings of this algorithm has been the\nleakage of harmonic instrument components into the Pbin\ncomponent and the leakage of low strength percussion into\ntheHbinportion.

A much faster algorithm using\nmedianÔ¨Ålteringhasbeenproposedin[14],buteventhat al-\ngorithmsuffersfromthesameshortcomings.\n3. THEPROPOSEDALGORITHM\nWe use only the percussion stream p[n]from the baseline\nalgorithm and the original signal x[n]for the postprocess-\ning technique we propose. Since percussion appears as a\nwidebandsignal in the spectrum and differentharmonicin-\nstrumentshavedifferentfrequencycharacteristics,nota llre-\ngions of the spectrum are equally affected by the harmonic\nleakage. Thereforewe intend to remove the leakages using\nsubband processing. The signal p[n]is passed through an\nevenstackedcosine modulatedperfectreconstructionÔ¨Ålte r-\nbank of 16 Ô¨Ålters. The Ô¨Ålterbank was designed using the\nLT-TOOLBOX2set of Matlab routines. The following op-\nerationsareperformedoneachsubbandsignal. Let pi[n]be\ntheoutputofthe ithsubband.

We intend to use the same\nframeworkwithaviewofincludingtemporalnoiseshaping\n(TNS)[2]foreachframein ourfuturework.\nLet the Hilbert transform for the jthframe be ÀÜPi(j,:).\nWe Ô¨ÅndtheHilbertenvelopeofthesignal[16]as:\nHi(j,:) =/radicalBig\nPi(j,:)2+ÀÜPi(j,:)2. (6)\nWe now use the sample mean of Hi(j,:)as a represen-\ntative for the jthframe (We also tried with the energy of\neachframeasa representativeandthemethodworksjustas\nÔ¨Åne, but since we intendto use TNS in our futurework,we\nchoosetoretaintheHilbertenvelopewithineachframe).\nH¬µ(i,j) =1\nNN/summationdisplay\nk=1Hi(j,k). (7)\nH¬µis used to detect the frames having percussion and\nharmonic instruments. In order to do this, H¬µis median\nÔ¨Ålteredwith a lpointmedianÔ¨Ålter.\nM(i,j) =median{H¬µ(i,j‚àík:j+k),k=l‚àí1/2},(8)\nwhere we used l= 7. We used a value of l= 7since\na median Ô¨Ålter whose length is greater than the duration of\nthe transient noise can suppress it [17] and most percussive\ntransientsarearound60-100mslong(3to5frameshiftsand\nhenceweusedthenextoddnumberedwindowlength).\nAsshownin Figure2, in HiandMthepresenceofhar-\nmonic instruments creates a change of shape in the usualgammafunctionenvelopesofpercussionsignals[18].

The\nthresholdforthe ithsubband, T(i)is computedas,\nT(i) =min(1.75,¬µ(i)+0.5‚àóœÉ(i)).(10)\nThis threshold was decided empirically after testing on a\nsmall dataset of audio clips and is similar to the one used\nin [19].\nIn the second method, we assume that we have poly-\nphonic audio with utmost 10%of the values of œÅare due\nto percussion. This is akin to the assumption that we have\n2percussionhitsof 50msdurationpersecondofthesignal.\nWe Ô¨Ånd a threshold from the histogram of œÅsuch that 10%\nof the valuesof œÅlie to the right and the remaining 90%lie\nto theleftofthethresholdinthe histogram.\nWeusethethresholdobtainedfromtheÔ¨Årstmethodsince\noptimization process for the second approach is still under\ndevelopment at the time of writing this paper. We now use\nthe threshold to determine the set of local maxima within\neachsubbandthatbelongtothepercussionas:\nF(i,j) =/braceleftbigg1ifH¬µ(i,j)> T(i).M(i,j),\n0otherwise .(11)\nWe locate local maxima in H¬µfor each subbandand re-\ntain only frames correspondingto them in Fwhile the rest\nof the frames are made 0. Since a percussive signal has a\ngamma function envelope, it has a minima to both sides of\nthe local envelope maxima on the time axis. Upon Ô¨Ånding\nthe local maxima in the signal, we need to Ô¨Ånd the local\nminima on both its sides on the time axis in order to fully\nreconstructthepercussivesignalasshownin Figure3.\nWe rebuild the exact percussion signal by using the Ô¨Årst\nlocal minimato the temporalleft and right of each detected\nmaxima as shown in Figure 4. This ensures that the entire\npercussion signal is preserved in the envelope. The set of\nnon-zeroframesin each subbandare consideredas the per-\ncussiveframes.\nThepercussiveframesfromeachsubbandareÔ¨Ånallyadded\nusing the overlap and add method to generate the subband\nsignal thatis percussionenhanced.

Also, the\npostprocessing technique performs better for a lower diffu -\nsion coefÔ¨Åcient Œ±.

INTRODUCTION\nTransientsare portionsof audiosignals that evolvefast an d\nunpredictably over a short time period [1]. Transients can\nbe classiÔ¨Åed as attack transients (sound onsets), rapid de-\ncay transients (sound offsets), fast transitions (portame n-\ntos) and noise/chaotic regimes (sounds like handclaps, rai n\netc) [2]. Percussive sounds, guitar slaps, stop consonants\n(uttered during singing) are very good examples of tran-\nsientsignals. Transientsgenerallylast for50msanddispl ay\nfast changesin amplitude and phase at variousfrequencies.\nTransients can be classiÔ¨Åed as weak or strong based on the\nstrengthoftheenvelopewhiletheycanalsobe charaterized\nas fast or slow dependingon the rate of change of envelope\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of thi s work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage an d that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on theÔ¨Årstpage.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for MusicInformation Retrieva l.amplitude. Fast transients have sharp amplitude envelopes\nwhile slow transients have broad (platykurtic) envelopes.\nTransient detection is an important problem in many areas\nofmusicresearchlike-audiocoding(parametricaudiocod-\ning [3], pre-echo reduction [4] etc), onset detection [5,6] ,\ntime-scalingofaudiosignals[2,7,8],notetranscription [2],\nrhythmanalysisandpercussiontranscription[9,10].\nOne of the Ô¨Årst attempts to detect and model transients was\nthe TMS (Transient Modeling Synthesis) model proposed\nin [11] as an extension to the popular sinusoidal modeling\nof McAulay et al. [12] and sine + noise model [13]. The\nbasic idea of the TMS model is the time-frequency dual-\nity. The TMS model is also dual to the sinusoidal model-\ning [12]. That is, by choosing a proper linear transform,\na pure sinusoid in time domain appears impulsive in the\nfrequency domain and an impulsive like signal in time do-\nmain looks sinusoidal in the frequency domain. Discrete\nCosine Transform (DCT) was thus chosen to provide the\nmapping from the time domain to the frequencydomain so\nthat transients in the time domain become sinusoidal in the\nfrequency domain. Energy of the original signal and its\nresidue from signal modeling using DCT is used for tran-\nsient detection. Masri et al. [5] used the high frequency\ncontentfeaturetodetectattacktransientsforthepurpose sof\naudioanalysis/synthesis. Abruptphasechangesinabankof\noctave spaced Ô¨Ålters has been employedto detect transients\nin [7]. Recently, group delay function has been used to de-\ntecttransientsinmonophonicandpitchedpercussiveinstr u-\nments[14]. In[15,16]linearpredictionfollowedbythresh -\nolding on the residual signal envelope have been used for\ntransientdetectionandmodeling. Roebelused thecenterof\ngravity (COG) of a signal to locate transients and use it for\nonset detection with good results [6]. Torresani et al. [17]\nhave used a concept of ‚Äútransientness‚Äú to detect transient\nsignals.

For a more exhaustive\n203Poster Session 2\nsurveyontransientdetectionwe referthe readerto[18].\nMost of the above discussed works use monophonic audio\nfor their results. Daudet et al. [18] conducted a survey of\nvarious techniques and their efÔ¨Åciency of transient detec-\ntiononthepopular‚Äúglockenspiel‚Äùand‚Äútrumpet‚Äùaudiosig-\nnals. Gnannet al. [14]haveusedthe EBU-SQAM database\n(monophonicsignals) to test their algorithmand we use the\nsame too.\nIn this paper, we propose to build on Ono et al. [19,20]\nbyusingamuchsimpleriterativeprocedure. Thisalgorithm\ncan be used for audio coding, rhythm analysis and percus-\nsiontranscriptionamongstthemanypossibletasks.\nThis paper is organised as follows. We describe our ap-\nproach and choice of parameters in section 2. Section 3\npresents our experimentalsetup, databases used and the re-\nsultsalongwithsomeadvantagesofourapproach. We con-\ncludeinsection4.\n2. THETRANSIENT DETECTION ALGORITHM\nWe consider percussive sounds(drums, tom-tomsetc), gui-\ntarslapsandsungconsonantsastransients. Theyshowupas\nvertical lines in spectrograms [19] . Our algorithm detects\nsuch vertical lines in the spectrogram that have sufÔ¨Åcient\nstrengthandbandwidth. Weintendtodetectreasonablyfast\npercussivetransientslikepianohits,guitarslapsandthe var-\nious drums while neglecting the slow transient signals like\ngongs.\nLetx[n]be a polyphonic audio signal. The signal is re-\nsampled at 16kHz to account for varied sampling rates and\nrecordingconditions(Thealgorithmworksat anysampling\nrate but we choose 16kHz to standardize steps for our TSR\nalgorithm). Thesignalisnormalisedsuchthatitsmaximum\nvalueis1asfollows,\nxnorm[n] =x[n]\nmax(|x[n]|). (1)\nThenormalizationstep isnotnecessaryforaudiocoding\napplications. This signal is now split into frames of 40 ms\nwith an overlapof 30ms. Each frame of the signal is multi-\nplied with a Blackman-Harris window of length, N= 640\nsamplestoreducesidelobes. A STFTofthe signalanalyses\nthe frequency content of the signal in regular periods. Let\nX(i,k)denotetheSTFT of the signalfor the ithframeand\nkthfrequencybin.

These derivative s\nindicate onsets and offsets respectively. Since transient s\nhave fast onsets followed by fast offsets, the T‚àíandT+\nfunctions should have high values at frames corresponding\nto transients. We now form a smoothened version of the\nabovefunctionsasfollows;\nF(i,j) = 0.5{j+ŒΩ/summationdisplay\nk=j‚àíŒΩ{1+sgn(T‚àí(i,k))}.T‚àí(i,k)\n+{1+sgn(T+(i,k))}.T+(i,k)},(5)\nwhere\nsgn(Œ∏) =/braceleftbigg1ifŒ∏‚â•0,\n‚àí1ifŒ∏ <0.(6)\nF(i,j)computestemporalchangesinthemagnitudespec-\ntrum at the frame i.F(i,j)considers half wave rectiÔ¨Åed\npositive values of T+andT‚àífunctions and adds it across\nfrequencybins j‚àíŒΩtoj+ŒΩ.

The main algo-\nrithm consists of 3 iterative steps. In the Ô¨Årst step, dynami c\nthresholdsarecomputed.Inthesecondstepthetransientsi g-\nnal updates are obtained.

Figure 2\nshows the changes in Fat a particular frequency bin after\nvarious iterations. As can be seen from Figure 2, Fde-\ncreases at places of transients and increases in the adjacen t\nframes. This is due to the deÔ¨Ånition of F, since it consid-\nersa contributionfrom T‚àíandT+onlyif theyarepositive.\nIf after a particular iteration, say T‚àí(i,j)becomes positive\nbecause|X(i‚àí1,j)|reduced from the previous iteration\n(see update equations in Algorithm.1), then F(i,j)can be\ngreaterthanitsvalueinthepreviousiteration.\nThe function Pat the end of Miterationsrepresentsthe\nspectrogramofthetransientsignal.

Two people annotated the\ndatabase independently. The common transient segments\nfrom both the annotators were chosen for our Ô¨Ånal ground\ntruth set. The database has a total of 1308 transient seg-\nments. The database was split into 2non-overlapping sets\nconsisting of 10clips for the training dataset having 406\ntransientsegmentsand23clipsforthetest datasetwith 902\ntransientsrespectively1.\nThe parameters Œ≤andŒªThrwere optimised using the\ntraining set consisting of 10 clips. Œ≤was varied in steps\nof0.1from1.25to2.5whileŒªThrwas varied as a frac-\ntion of frame length N(i.eN/10,N/9,N/8...). A transient\nwas declared to have been found if the extracted transient\noverlapped with the ground truth segment. We got optimal\nperformance for Œ≤= 2andŒªThr=N/6.ŒªThrparameter\nselects only signiÔ¨Åcantly long vertical lines in the spectr o-\ngram while Œ≤parameter evaluates the strength of the tran-\nsients.

TheF measureisthus 0.91.\nWe have also tested our algorithm on the EBU-SQAM\npercussive monophonic database [14]. The testing proce-\ndure followedin [14]was used for testing our algorithmon\nthis database. The EBU-SQAM database has 276percus-\nsive transients in 24Ô¨Åles. Our algorithm correctly detected\n237transients correctly while 11transients were detected\nas FP. This gives our algorithm an F-measure of 0.90. This\ncomparesvery well with the results from [14], where an F-\nmeasure of 0.92is achieved on the same dataset of EBU-\nSQAM database. While the parameters in [14] are opti-\nmized for the EBU-SQAM database, we use the same pa-\nrametersthatareoptimizedforourLSMLpolyphonicmusic\ndatabase.\nFor the EBU-SQAM database we observed that we got\nfalse positives during the slow transient portionsof the si g-\nnal orforsignalswith heavyringinginthe decaytail.

INTRODUCTION\nDictionary learning, sparse coding, and constrained factor-\nization algorithms have recently revolutionized the way we\nperform music transcription and source separation. Many\nresearchers have reported success when decomposing sim-\nple musical signals using nonnegative matrix factorization\n(NMF) [23] or methods based upon sparse coding such as\nK-SVD [1,2]. Unfortunately, problems remain for intricate,\npolyphonic musical signals. When musical notes overlap\nin time and frequency, the separation and transcription per-\nformance of these basic dictionary learning methods dimin-\nishes rapidly. In such a case, the algorithm will usually learn\na dictionary where each individual atom contains informa-\ntion from multiple musical sources, thus hindering our at-\ntempts at decomposition.\nResearchers have slowly improved upon the original dic-\ntionary learning methods by adding constraints to the learn-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.ing process. By restricting the dictionary atoms to reside\nwithin a predetermined feasible set, we can ensure that the\nlearned atoms will be useful at the conclusion of the learn-\ning process. For example, existing solutions include adding\nconstraints to the dictionary learning process such as har-\nmonicity [3, 25] or smoothness [3, 26].\nAnother solution is to add structure to the dictionary. For\nexample, one can construct and use a large, predeÔ¨Åned, over-\ncomplete dictionary where each atom is already labeled and\nassumed to contain information from only one musical source.\nInstead of learning an optimal dictionary for a given musi-\ncal signal, it may sufÔ¨Åce to match the signal to this large set\nof precomputed, labeled dictionary atoms. Then, by decom-\nposing a signal with respect to this Ô¨Åxed dictionary, classiÔ¨Å-\ncation is easily achieved by simply reading the label of the\natom. As musical databases become more available, con-\nstruction of predeÔ¨Åned dictionaries will become easier, thus\nreducing the need for adaptive dictionary learning.\nOf course, the performance of such an algorithm depends\nupon the breadth of the dictionary. When atoms from more\nmusical sources are added to the dictionary, the dictionary‚Äôs\nability to decompose polyphonic music will improve. How-\never, dictionary growth introduces concerns related to scal-\nability and computational complexity. While the aforemen-\ntioned algorithms have signiÔ¨Åcantly advanced the state of\nthe art, they remain slow and difÔ¨Åcult to scale as the dictio-\nnary size increases. Most of the original factorization meth-\nods such as matching pursuit (MP) [18] and NMF with mul-\ntiplicative updates [17] have complexity that is linear in the\nsize of the dictionary. As a result, when dictionary sizes\ngrow, the transcription efÔ¨Åciency of these algorithms dimin-\nishes.\nTo summarize the problem: how can we make use of\na large, precomputed, overcomplete dictionary to factorize\noverlapping harmonic sounds accurately and efÔ¨Åciently?\nWe address this problem by proposing a variant of MP\ncalled approximate matching pursuit (AMP). Unlike MP and\nNMF, AMP can decompose signals into a sparse combina-\ntion of atoms with complexity that is sublinear in the dictio-\nnary size while maintaining accuracy. To do this, AMP uses\n257Poster Session 2\nan approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) method to Ô¨Ånd ap-\nproximate matches to the signal residual at each iteration.\nThe ANN method that we choose in this work is locality\nsensitive hashing (LSH), a probabilistic hash algorithm that\nplaces similar, yet not identical, observations into the same\nbin. LSH can retrieve near neighbors with a complexity that\nis sublinear in the dictionary size.\nOur experiments demonstrate that AMP is as capable as\northogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [20] for decomposing\npolyphonic musical spectra into combinations of atoms from\na large dictionary of over 17,000 labeled musical spectra.\nMeanwhile, AMP requires less computation and factorizes\nmore quickly than OMP.\n2. RELATED WORK\nComputation of sparse coefÔ¨Åcients with respect to a large,\novercomplete dictionary is often accomplished by pursuit\nalgorithms such as MP [18]. This greedy algorithm directly\naddresses the issue of sparsity by decomposing a signal, x,\ninto a linear expansion of waveforms that are selected from\na redundant dictionary of functions. When stopped after a\nfew iterations, this algorithm yields a signal approximation\nusing only a few atoms. After each iteration of the MP al-\ngorithm, the residual, r, is orthogonal to the previously se-\nlected vector, ak, but not necessarily orthogonal to the dic-\ntionary vectors selected earlier.\nPati et al. proposed OMP, an improvement over MP which\nensures that the residual is orthogonal to all previously se-\nlected dictionary vectors [20]. After dictionary atoms are\nselected for inclusion into the decomposition, an extra or-\nthogonalization step is performed by solving a least-squares\nproblem. Researchers have shown that OMP provides a dra-\nmatic improvement over MP [20]. In many cases, when an\ninput signal is known to be k-sparse, OMP converges in k\niterations, while MP will require many more iterations to\nconverge.\nPursuit algorithms have been applied to MIR in many\nways. The most popular applications are music transcription\nand source separation. Harmonic matching pursuit (HMP)\nhas been used to decompose an audio signal into Gabor or\nharmonic (i.e., sums of Gabor) atoms [15]. Dictionaries of\natoms can also be adapted and learned to Ô¨Åt the data [9]. To\nresolve instances when harmonics from separate notes over-\nlap, some algorithms impose smoothness constraints [4].\nSimilar sparse coding methods have been used for genre\nrecognition [19]. In the neurological signal processing lit-\nerature, pursuit methods for generic acoustic signals have\nbeen applied for coding purposes [24].\nCotton and Ellis [10] also use LSH together with MP,\nhowever that work addresses a fundamentally different prob-\nlem ‚Äì content-based search of whole acoustic events, e.g.,\nthe sound made by a horse‚Äôs hoof. There, the sparse repre-sentation produced by MP is stored using LSH. On the other\nhand, our proposed method addresses the problems of tran-\nscription and source separation. As shown later, we enhance\nMP by embedding LSH within MP to make it faster and\nmore scalable. Also, we use a massive dictionary of real-\nworld musical spectra, not synthetic Gabor atoms as in [10].\n3. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nGiven the magnitude spectrum of an input signal, x‚ààRM,\nand a dictionary, A= [a1a2...aK]‚ààRM√óK, the problem\nis to Ô¨Ånd a vector of coefÔ¨Åcients s‚ààRKthat minimizes\n||x‚àíAs||2.\nWhenM < K , the dictionary is called overcomplete ,\nand there are inÔ¨Ånitely many solutions for s. However, by\nimposing a sparsity constraint on s, the solution space di-\nminishes greatly, possibly to a unique solution. In particu-\nlar, if the input is truly a sparse linear combination of dic-\ntionary atoms, i.e., x=As0, where s0is a sparse vector,\nthen the problem becomes Ô¨Ånding an optimal set of coefÔ¨Å-\ncients, ÀÜs= argmins||x‚àíAs||2, that is equal to the input\ncoefÔ¨Åcients, i.e., ÀÜs=s0.\nAn exhaustive search for the sparsest solution is NP-hard\n[12]. However, suboptimal greedy algorithms such as OMP\noften work well in practice. Unfortunately, OMP requires\nat leastKinner products to computed during each iteration,\nthus creating a complexity that is at least linear in K. Be-\ncause this complexity is too slow for large dictionaries, the\nproblem becomes solving for ÀÜs=s0using an algorithm that\nhas complexity that is sublinear in the dictionary size, K.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the dictionary\nis overcomplete, M < K ; this assumption is not strictly\nnecessary for AMP to operate. We also assume that the true\nsparsity of any input signal, ||s0||0, is less than the dimen-\nsionality,M. For musical signals, this assumption usually\nholds in practice. For example, even in highly polyphonic\nmusic, the number of simultaneous sounds will likely be sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly less than the dimensionality of our spectra, i.e., the\nnumber of frequency bins. If not, then we increase the FFT\nsize to produce longer spectra.\n4. PROPOSED ALGORITHM: APPROXIMATE\nMATCHING PURSUIT\nOne drawback of existing pursuit methods such as MP and\nOMP is their complexity. When the dictionary size, K, be-\ncomes very large (e.g., over one million), these methods\nmay require an unacceptably large amount of computation\nto Ô¨Ånd an answer. For example, in each iteration of MP,\nKinner products must be computed between the residual\nrand every atom in the dictionary ‚Äì a complexity of order\nO(MK). Here, we introduce a simple variation of these\npursuit methods that uses an ANN algorithm in place of\n25812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncomputingKinner products as done in MP. As a result, we\ncan reduce the complexity to be sublinear in K.\nThe approximate matching pursuit (AMP) algorithm is\ndescribed in Algorithm 1. This algorithm is similar to OMP\nexcept that it addresses the main computational bottleneck\nfor large dictionaries ‚Äì nearest neighbor search ‚Äì by allow-\ning any adequately near neighbor to be selected as a compo-\nnent.\nAlgorithm 1 Approximate Matching Pursuit [Tjoa and Liu]\nInput: x‚ààRM;A= [a1,a2,...,aK]‚ààRM√óKs.t.\n||ak||2= 1for allk.\nOutput: ÀÜs‚ààRK\nInitialize:S‚Üê‚àÖ ;s‚Üê0;r‚Üêx;/epsilon1>0.\nwhile||r||>/epsilon1do\nFind anyksuch that akandrare near neighbors.\nS‚ÜêS‚à™k\nSolve for{sj|j‚ààS} :minsj|j‚ààS||x‚àí/summationtext\nj‚ààSajsj||2\nr‚Üêx‚àíAs\nÀÜs‚Üês\nAMP intentionally resembles MP and OMP. Like OMP,\nAMP is capable of providing a sparse decomposition in far\nfewer iterations than MP. If the ANN retrieval method were\ninstead changed to a nearest-neighbor (NN) method, then\nAMP would yield identical results to OMP. Also, AMP is\nÔ¨Çexible in the sense that any ANN method could be used as\nlong as it performs retrieval in sublinear time. Therefore,\nAMP can also be considered as a modular framework of al-\ngorithms.\nDespite its simplicity, AMP embodies a fundamentally\ndifferent philosophy to signal factorization. AMP is a data-\ndriven algorithm, not a model- or knowledge-based algo-\nrithm. With such an abundance of available musical data, we\nuse side information, not rigid mathematical models, to rep-\nresent test data. Algorithmic advances such as AMP, cou-\npled with technological advances in computing, are mak-\ning data-driven algorithms more computationally feasible\nfor problems in MIR such as transcription and source sepa-\nration.\n5. LOCALITY SENSITIVE HASHING\nAMP allows the use of any ANN algorithm that can per-\nform retrieval in sublinear time. For this work, we focus on\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH), a category of algorithms\nthat places nearby points in a high-dimensional space into\nthe same bin in a hash table. Because of its simplicity,\nrobustness, and low complexity, LSH has become popular\nfor solving many high-level problems beyond MIR such as\nsearch and retrieval of text and images. The robustness of\nLSH is desirable for problems in MIR where queries are of-\nten distorted due to environmental or musical variation, andtherefore, learned dictionary atoms will rarely match prede-\nÔ¨Åned dictionary atoms exactly. Ryyn ¬®anen and Klapuri used\nLSH to perform query-by-humming (QBH) by constructing\na hash table from pitch contour vectors [21]. Yu et al. use\nLSH and order statistics to store chroma features in a hash\ntable for audio content retrieval [28]. Cotton and Ellis use\nLSH to store landmarks in audio that correspond to mean-\ningful acoustic events [10]. Casey and Slaney have used\nLSH to store features called audio shingles for computing\nvarious levels of musical similarity between songs [5‚Äì7].\nHowever, LSH has rarely been used for signal-level prob-\nlems like music transcription. To our knowledge, this work\nis among the Ô¨Årst in MIR to use LSH for low-level tasks\nsuch as sparse coding and music transcription.\nWhile other ANN algorithms can be used within AMP\ninstead of LSH, such as those that use space partitioning\nlike the kd-tree and hierarchical k-means, these algorithms\ndo not work well in high-dimensional spaces, i.e., dimen-\nsionality over 100. In fact, all current indexing techniques\nbased on space partitioning degrade to linear search for suf-\nÔ¨Åciently high dimensions [11, 14, 27]. Therefore, we only\nconsider LSH in this work.\nIn this work, for i‚àà{1,2,...,k}and/lscript‚àà{1,2,...,L},\nwe deÔ¨Åne the function h/lscript\nito be\nh/lscript\ni(q) = sign/angbracketleftp/lscript\ni,q/angbracketright (1)\nwhere p/lscript\niis a zero-mean, unit variance, Gaussian random\nvector with independent elements. As illustrated later, the\nparameterskandLadjust the tradeoff between recall and\nprecision of the dictionary atoms.\nIt has been shown that this choice of distribution on p/lscript\ni\nwill hash points together whose angle,\nŒ∏(q,r) = arccos/angbracketleftq,r/angbracketright\n||q||||r||, (2)\nis small [8]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, it can be shown that, for any iand\n/lscript, the probability that h/lscript\ni(q) =h/lscript\ni(r)is equal to\nP(h/lscript\ni(q) =h/lscript\ni(r)) = 1‚àíŒ∏(q,r)\nœÄ. (3)\nWe claim that two hashes are equal, h(q) =h(r), if and\nonly if there exists an /lscriptsuch that, for all i‚àà{1,2,...,k},\nh/lscript\ni(q) =h/lscript\ni(r). In other words, the following events are\nequivalent:\n{h(q) =h(r)}=‚à™L\n/lscript=1‚à©k\ni=1{h/lscript\ni(q) =h/lscript\ni(r)}.(4)\nFrom (3) and (4), it can be shown that the probability that\nh(q) =h(r)is equal to\nP(h(q) =h(r)) = 1‚àí/parenleftBigg\n1‚àí/parenleftbigg\n1‚àíŒ∏(q,r)\nœÄ/parenrightbiggk/parenrightBiggL\n.(5)\n259Poster Session 2\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.80.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.80.20.40.60.8Figure 1 .

Among these retrieved points that\nshare a bin with r, we perform exhaustive search to Ô¨Ånd\nthe nearest neighbor among them. As indicated by Eq. 5,\nthrough the proper choice of kandL, one can achieve any\ndesired amount of similarity between any two input vectors.\nAn example of LSH is shown in Figure 1 when k= 2.\nPoints on the unit sphere are hashed, and those points that\nreside in the same bin share the same marker. We notice that\npoints in the same bin are close together.\nThere are many theoretical results for LSH that are be-\nyond the scope of this paper. For detailed discussion and\nproofs, please see [11, 14, 22, 27].\n6. EXPERIMENTS\nTo illustrate the performance of AMP, we factorize poly-\nphonic spectra as sparse combinations of atoms from a dic-\ntionary of real piano sounds. First, we discuss how to build a\ndictionary. For this work, our data comes from the Univer-\nsity of Iowa database of musical instrument samples [13].\nEach Ô¨Åle in the data set is labeled by pitch and loudness,\ne.g., ‚ÄúPiano C4 mf‚Äù, and contains a signal of an isolated\nnote sampled at 44100 Hz. We only consider the subset of\npiano sounds.\nFor each signal, we compute a short-time Fourier trans-\nform with a frame size of 92.9 milliseconds (i.e., 4096/44100)\nand a hop of 10 milliseconds. To discard silent segments, wedetect any spectrum whose power is below a threshold. The\nremaining spectra are normalized to have unit Euclidean\nnorm and are saved along with their pitch labels. These nor-\nmalized spectra constitute the dictionary, A, and the pitch\nlabels are used later to evaluate matches among dictionary\natoms. In total, we use a dictionary of 17,753 spectra of pi-\nano sounds covering the entire piano keyboard (i.e., MIDI\nvalues 21 through 108).\nFor the following experiments, the input to AMP is a\nvector x‚ààRM, a magnitude spectrum containing overlap-\nping harmonic sounds, where x=As0.Ais the dictionary\nof sizeM-by-Kdescribed earlier, and s0is a synthetically\ngenerated sparse vector of length KcontainingŒªones in\nuniformly random locations. In other words, Œªdetermines\nthe number of overlapping sounds at any moment. We vary\nŒªin the following experiments.\nThe LSH structure accepts parameters Landk, whereL\nis the number of LSH tables and kis the length of each key.\nThe dictionary, A, is used to populate each of the LLSH\ntables as described in Section 5. Finally, given the input\nxand the LSH tables, AMP produces a sparse coefÔ¨Åcient\nvector, ÀÜs.\nGiven the output, ÀÜs, we count the number of hits, misses,\nand false alarms. A hit occurs if an element in s0matches\nan element in ÀÜs. A miss occurs if an element in s0does not\nmatch any element in ÀÜs. A false alarm occurs if an element\ninÀÜsdoes not match any element in s0. A match occurs when\ntwo coefÔ¨Åcients share the same pitch label.\nAll source code is written in Python using the NumPy,\nSciPy, and Matplotlib packages [16].\nIn Figure 2, we compare AMP against another pursuit\nmethod, OMP. For each algorithm, using the number of hits,\nmisses, and false alarms, we plot the recall, precision, and\nF-measure. Recall is deÔ¨Åned as R=hits/(hits + misses),\nprecision is deÔ¨Åned as P=hits/(hits + false alarms), and\nF-measure is deÔ¨Åned as F= 2PR/(P+R). We also mon-\nitor the execution time and number of M-dimensional inner\nproducts computed by each algorithm. All quantities are av-\neraged over twenty independent trials.\nFrom Figure 2, we see that the recall, precision, and F-\nmeasure are all relatively similar for both algorithms. The\nrecall for AMP is nearly as high as that of OMP. The gap\nin precision between the algorithms is slightly larger. In\npractice, the stopping criterion can affect the tradeoff be-\ntween recall and precision. When convergence occurs early,\nÀÜsis more sparse; therefore, recall decreases and precision\nincreases. When convergence occurs late, ÀÜsis less sparse;\ntherefore, recall increases and precision decreases. For this\nwork, we simply Ô¨Åx the stopping criterion such that the ratio\nof the residual norm to the input norm, ||r||/||x||, is equal to\n0.25. A more sophisticated stopping criterion may be able\nto improve this tradeoff.\nNext, we plot the execution time. Results show that AMP\n26012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nexecutes approximately two to four times faster than OMP.\nThe parameters used in LSH, (L,k), affect execution time.\nWhen the length of the key, k, is low, then there are fewer\nkeys and more elements per bin. Therefore, the candidate set\nof spectra is larger. When kis high, there are more keys and\nfewer elements per bin resulting in a smaller candidate set.\nThe number of tables, L, has the opposite effect of k. When\nLis high, the size of the candidate set increases. When Lis\nlow, the candidate set size decreases.\nFinally, we plot the number of M-dimensional inner prod-\nucts computed by both algorithms. This measure describes\nthe primary source of computational effort. We see that\nOMP requires far more inner products than AMP. For OMP,\neach iteration requires Kinner products because the resid-\nual is matched against every dictionary atom. For AMP,\neach iteration requires far fewer than Kinner products be-\ncause LSH only retrieves those dictionary atoms that are\nlikely close to the residual vector. However, we notice that\nthe gap in the number of inner products computed by OMP\nand AMP is larger than the gap in execution time. This dis-\ncrepancy is largely caused by overhead required of LSH, for\nexample, key computation, data subset retrieval, etc. Opti-\nmizing these operations at a lower level could further widen\nthe gap in execution time between AMP and OMP.\n7. CONCLUSION\nWe have proposed AMP, a pursuit algorithm that can decom-\npose overlapping harmonic spectra as well as OMP while\nexecuting in less time and requiring fewer computations.\nWe have shown that the recall, precision, and F-measure for\nAMP is comparable with that of OMP. Unlike OMP which\nhas complexity that is linear in the size of the dictionary,\nAMP has sublinear complexity and is therefore much faster.\nThe simple modiÔ¨Åcation of using LSH in place of exhaustive\nlinear search makes previously infeasible techniques feasi-\nble once again. Previously, LSH has primarily been used to\nsolve high-level tasks such as song or document retrieval;\nhere, we use LSH for the signal-level tasks of factorization\nand separation.\nAMP, like many recently proposed machine learning al-\ngorithms, uses real data rather than contrived models and\nconstraints to describe musical spectra. We hope that this\nsimple algorithm inspires a new class of methods that intel-\nligently exploit the abundant musical data that already exists\namong public collections rather than chasing gains in fully\nunsupervised algorithms where little progress is left to be\nmade.\nThe dictionary itself has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the de-\ncomposition. Therefore, future work will include proper\ndictionary design, i.e., how to create dictionary atoms from\nmusical data sets for maximum accuracy and efÔ¨Åciency. Dic-\ntionary design also affects the proper choice of LSH param-eters,Landk. A careful analysis of pairwise distances\namong dictionary atoms can reveal which set of LSH pa-\nrameters minimizes the probability of error.\n8. REFERENCES\n[1] M.

Precedingthis,adiscussionofthehistoricallysi gnif-\nicantSpectral Music composition movement is presented,\nwhere spectrogram analysis and data-mining generated ma-\nterial fornew musical works.\n2. BACKGROUND\nAudio decomposition methods in computer-assisted music\ncomposition have a rich history in musical discourse over\nthepasttwentyyears,notablyWishart‚ÄôsexpansionofPierr e\nSchaeffer‚Äôs MusicObjets [22],andSmalley‚ÄôsSpectro-mor-\nphology [19]. One approach of particular relevance, for-\nmallynamed MusiqueSpectrale ,usesextractedtimbralfea-\ntures for the purpose of creating new works, both acoustic\nand electro-acoustic in nature. Spectral Music was Ô¨Årst in-\ntroduced by Henry Dufourt in 1979 [10], however by this\ntime compositions using materials extracted from Fourier\ntransforms had already been written by the group, most no-\ntably G¬¥erard Grisey‚Äôs ‚ÄúPartiels Pour 18 Musiciense‚Äù [12],\nwhere the composer proposed macro-synthesis of analyzed\nsourcesusingcombinationsofacousticmusicalinstrument s.\nIn most of these early pieces, there was a transparent and\nstraightforwardprocessbywhichthecomposerderivedma-\nterialsfor new works, outlined inFigure 1.\nA wellspring of software development at the Institut de\nRecherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM)\noccurredduringthistime,includingthevisualprogrammin g\nenvironmentMax,afterMaxMatthews,alongwithmanyof\nthewell-knownIRCAMpackagemodulesincluding‚ÄúMusic\nV‚Äù brought to IRCAM by Jean-Claude Risset, who came to\nfurther timbre research, as well as CHANT, developed by\nXavier Rodet, and the transcription tools that now belong\ntoOpen Music . Amongst the composers belonging to the\nÔ¨Årst-waveofSpectralcompositionwereG ¬¥erardGrisey,Tris-\ntanMurail,HuguesDufourt,andBritishcomposerJonathan\n579Poster Session 4\nHarvey. Their music inÔ¨Çuenced a younger cadre of com-\nposers, including Magnus Lindberg, Marc-Andre Dalbavie\nand Joshua Fineberg.\nThe purpose of this shift in compositional thought pos-\nsesses deeper connections to the European Zeitgeist of the\n1960‚Äôs and1970‚Äôs. The prevailing school of thought be-\ning ‚ÄúTotal Serialism‚Äù was the only credible way to be a re-\nspected contemporary composer, built upon ideas Ô¨Årst pio-\nneeredbytheSecondVienneseSchool,consistingofArnold\nSchoenberg, and his disciples Anton Webern, and Alban\nBerg [11]. The Spectralists realized the aesthetics associ -\nated with mainstream Serialism of the time disregarded the\nÔ¨Ånal sounded musical experience. Instead, these technique s\nfavored abstraction in notation and formalism blinded, to a\ncertain extent, by the ideas that all 12-tone (half-step rel a-\ntionships) were equal, and that non-western tuning systems\nwere not relevant tomainstream Western‚Äúart‚Äù music.\nThe Spectralists thus considered observation of sounded\nacoustic sources to be the startingpoint of their work. They\nfurther rejected both ideas that 12-tones were equal. Their\nearlyrepertoireemphasizedthesepoints,withpiecessuch as\n‚ÄúGodwana‚Äù [15], that evokes a sense of non-western tuning\nbyexploringtherelationshipbetweenasyntheticbellsour ce\nand a spectrally analyzed trombone sample and later with\n‚ÄúD¬¥esint¬¥egrations‚Äù [16] that utilizes the careful blending of\ntimbres between electronic sounds and acoustic sources.\n3. REVEALING LATENT STRUCTURE IN AUDIO\nAside from socio-political currents in their work, the Spec -\ntralists‚Äô perspective emphasized uncovering hidden infor -\nmation in sound to generate new musical ideas.

INTRODUCTION\nThe tempo is a dominant element connected to the hierarchi-\ncal structure of a music signal that can deÔ¨Åne various aspects\nof it. Moreover, it is an intuitive music property that hu-\nman listeners, even without any musical education are able\nto perceive and understand only by listening to the Ô¨Årst few\nseconds of an excerpt. The tempo is deÔ¨Åned as the rate of\nthetactus pulse, a prominent level in the hierarchical struc-\nture of music, which is also referred to as the foot-tapping\nrate.\nThe process of automatically inferring the tempo of a\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.musical piece plays an important role among the applica-\ntions in the Ô¨Åeld of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Many\nof them, for example, beat tracking and music classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion, need a preprocessing stage where tempo estimation\ntakes place. Beyond these, tempo induction is essential in\nmusic similarity and recommendation, automatic transcrip-\ntion and even audio editing. More complicated tasks such\nas meter extraction and rhythm description also demand a\ntempo estimation module. Finally, in applications with beat\nsynchronous visual and audio effects the estimation of the\ntempo is a necessary part.\nIn such applications it is desired that correct tempo esti-\nmation would be available to the system at about the same\ntime that the tempo is detected by a human listener. This\nis technically very difÔ¨Åcult because the human listeners are\nable to use higher-level context cues to conduct tempo de-\ntection. In fact, many algorithms proposed for tempo es-\ntimation in the past [7, 11] require a long signal segment\nfor producing reliable results. This is clearly a problem in\ncontents such as radio programs, where the rhythmic music\ncontent may alternate with, for example, speech segments\nTempo induction algorithms follow a general scheme [4,\n5], that consists of two main stages. In the Ô¨Årst stage, the\naudio signal is parsed and a set of features is created. These\nfeatures convey an initial rhythmic structure of the input mu-\nsical piece. Literature reveals two main methods to obtain\nfeatures: either from a list of the inter onset intervals (IOIs)\nof the musical signal or from the temporal evolution of the\nmusical signal.\nRepresentative algorithms that fall in the Ô¨Årst category,\nand use IOIs for the creation of the feature list, are presented\nin [1‚Äì3]. Algorithms in the second category rely on features\nextracted directly from the audio signal. These features may\nemphasize onset locations but they do not result from on-\nset lists. In [11] an amplitude envelope of the signal in six\noctave-spaced subbands is created at the Ô¨Årst stage of the\nsystem. This approach is expanded in [7], where a more\n197Poster Session 2\ngeneric and therefore robust accent signal is created across\nfour subbands.\nDuring the second stage of the tempo estimation scheme,\nperiodic recurrences of the features are found and the tempo\nis calculated. There are several methods to achieve this. For\nexample, the autocorrelation function (ACF) [12], comb-\nÔ¨Ålter resonators [7, 11] and phase-locking resonators [8].\nThe method proposed in this paper uses Gammatone anal-\nysis and linear prediction for extracting the feature list. Af-\nter that, the estimation of the existing periodicities takes\nplace. As a last step to the algorithm, a perceptual weighting\nmethod is proposed for enhancing the system‚Äôs accuracy.\nThe results of the system are encouraging and indicate\nthat the addition of a perceptually inspired stage at the end\nis advantageous for an algorithm that follows the tempo es-\ntimation general architecture. In addition to that, the use of\na single, 4 seconds long, frame to obtain the Ô¨Ånal results, fa-\ncilitates the proposed algorithm to quickly adapt to possible\ntempo changes in a given music excerpt.\nThe Gammatone Ô¨Ålterbank models the input signal using\na frequency resolution which is similar to that of the hu-\nman auditory system. Moreover, the use of LPEFs in the\nÔ¨Årst step, enables the accentuation of points where abrupt\nchanges take place in any frequency band of the input sig-\nnal. These points in time are considered signiÔ¨Åcant for the\ntask of tempo estimation.\nThe perceptual processing, that starts with the applica-\ntion of the Gammatone Ô¨Ålterbank on the input signal, pro-\nceeds with the weighting method that is added as a last step\non the system. This weighting method is based on a reso-\nnance model that has been found to follow the perceptual\nresponses to a variety of musical excerpts [10, 13]. The use\nof this model in order to enhance a tempo estimation system\nis novel and leads to promising results.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section\n2 the architecture of the system is described. Section 3 pro-\nvides results and evaluates the developed system. Finally,\nconclusions and future work are discussed in Section 4.\n2. METHOD DESCRIPTION\nThe developed system follows the general scheme of tempo\nestimation algorithms, with the addition of a last step where\nthe perceptual processing of the results takes place. The\nblock diagram of the system is shown in Figure 1. Each one\nof the three major units depicted there, is described in details\nin the following sections.\n2.1 Feature List Extraction\nWhen a listener listens to music, the musical events are re-\nlated to a regular pattern of beats, called metrical structure .\nThese patterns are organised in a metrical hierarchy that ex-\nists in every musical sound and consists of two or more lev-\nFeature List \nExtraction Tempo  \nInduction Perceptual \nModel  \nfeature \nlist  \nwinning \ntempi estimated \ntempo input \nsignal Figure 1 .

When a beat is felt stronger that the other beats of the\nsame metrical level then it is also a beat at the higher musical\nlevel. This hierarchy is depicted in Figure 2, where also the\nÔ¨Årst three levels of it are presented. The tempo is described\nas the rate of the tactus beat, or based on the above explana-\ntion the rate at which strong beats appear at the tatum level.\nDuring this stage of the analysis the goal is to detect\nevents that are connected to the strong beat of the tatum\nlevel. To achieve this, it is assumed that any event per-\nceived as a strong beat will appear as an abrupt increase in\nthe temporal evolution of the musical signal, baring signiÔ¨Å-\ncantly more transient content than the rest of the beat-related\nevents.\nLet us consider the input music signal x[n]. The Ô¨Årst step\nof the processing is the application of a bank of KGamma-\ntone Ô¨Ålters on it:\nxk[n] =hk[n]‚ãÜx[n]k‚àà[0,1,...,K‚àí1],(1)\nwherehk[n]the impulse response of the k-th Gammatone\nÔ¨Ålter. During the implementation the value Kwas chosen\nto be 16.\nAfter the Ô¨Åltering of the input signal, each subband signal\nis decimated Ktimes as follows\nxk[n] =xk[Kn]. (2)\nThexk[n]signals are then given as an input to a bank of\nadaptive LPEFs. The use of the LPEFs enables the detection\nof abrupt changes in the temporal evolution of the signal. By\nadapting the linear prediction coefÔ¨Åcients that these Ô¨Ålters\nuse, it is possible to emphasize the events that the adaptive\nalgorithm fails to model. The strong beats that appear at the\ntatum level are connected to these events.\nThe output of the adaptive LPEFs is the prediction er-\nror of the adaptive linear predictive algorithm given in Al-\ngorithm 1. This algorithm is based on estimating the LPC\n19812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ncoefÔ¨Åcients of the initial Mvalues of the Nlong frame, and\nadapting these coefÔ¨Åcients using the Least Mean Squares\n(LMS) algorithm for the remaining N‚àíMsamples. The\nselected values for MandNare 23 ms and 1 second re-\nspectively (converted in samples). More details on linear\nprediction and the LMS algorithm can be found in [6].\nThe output signal, dfk[n], is the detection function , a\nresidual signal that presents high values when beat related\nevents take place in the temporal evolution of the signal.\nAlgorithm 1 The implemented adaptive LPEF algorithm.\nmu‚Üê10‚àí3\nwk[0]‚ÜêLPC(xk[0])\nforn= 1toN‚àíMdo\nÀúxk[n]‚ÜêwT\nk[n]‚ãÜxk[n]\ndfk[n]‚Üêxk[n]‚àíÀúxk[n]\n¬µ‚Üêmin/parenleftBig\nmu,1\nxT\nk[n]xk[n]/parenrightBig\nwk[n+ 1]‚Üêwk[n] +¬µdfk[n]xk[n]\nn‚Üên+ 1\nend for\nA peak picking procedure, applied on the analysis frames\n(of lengthN) of the smoothed and normalized signals dfk[n],\nproduces a time series\ntsk[n] =/braceleftBigg\n1ifdfk[n]demonstrates a peak here\n0otherwise(3)\nDuring peak picking, an adaptive threshold, calculated by\nthe sum of a predeÔ¨Åned, static threshold and a moving me-\ndian Ô¨Ålter is used.\nThe time series tsk[n]are then convolved with a Hanning\nwindow in order to produce the mask functions mk[n]. In\nthat way, a strongly smoothed version of the corresponding\ndetection function is created that however accentuates the\ndetected abrupt events. The above described processing for\nthe creation of the feature list combines the advantages of\nthe use of an onset list with those methods where the feature\nlists are obtained in a continuous manner.\n2.2 Tempo Induction\nIn the second part of the system, the periodicity analysis\nis carried out, in order to infer the tempo from the list of\nfeatures ( i.e.mask functions). The periodicity analysis is\ndone using a bank of comb Ô¨Ålters.\nEach one of the mask functions ,mk[n]is given as an\ninput to a bank of comb Ô¨Ålters. Therefore, for the analysis\nbandkthe following takes place:\nyk,œÑ[n] =aœÑyk,œÑ[n‚àíœÑ] + (1‚àíaœÑ)mk[n], (4)\nfor everyœÑ‚ààT. The intervalTranges from 42 to 242 beats\nper minute (BMP). In this interval the Ô¨Ålter‚Äôs delay œÑtakesinteger values. The term aœÑcorresponds to the Ô¨Ålter‚Äôs feed-\nback gain and it is calculated as a= 0.5œÑ\nT0. The time during\nwhich the signal should reach its half energy is T0. In this\nsystemT0is equal to 4 seconds. The selection of this time\nframe is motivated by the smallest tempi normally found in\na piece of music. With a minimum tempo of 42 BPM, this\nframe is big enough to cover at least two repetitions of the\nbeat but also small enough for the system to quickly adapt\nto any tempo changes, when more than one frames are used\nas an input.\nThe energy of each Ô¨Ålter, in each frequency band kis\nthen calculated by\nek,œÑ[n] =1\nœÑn/summationdisplay\ni=n‚àíœÑ+1yk,œÑ[i]2. (5)\nA sum across all the frequency bands kwill result to a wide\nband energy signal for each tempo œÑ\neœÑ[n] =K/summationdisplay\nk=1ek,œÑ[n] (6)\nSo far, for every time index nof the input signal we ob-\ntain a vector\ne= [e42[n]e43[n]... e 242[n]]T(7)\nconsisting of the instant energies in every periodicity œÑ‚ààT.\nTheNTmaximum components of the vector eare then\nselected in order to form a vector w. The corresponding\ntempi form the vector T. The vector Tcontains the winning\ntempi , and vector wtheir relative weights.\n2.3 Perceptual Model\nThe ambiguity in the perception of tempo has been modelled\nand tested in experiments [10, 13] where the distribution of\nresponses from several listeners to the same pieces of music\nwere studied. This analysis resulted in the following reso-\nnance model:\nAe(t) =1/radicalBig\n(t2o‚àít2)2+Œ≤t2‚àí1/radicalbig\nt4o+t4, (8)\nwhereAeis the effective resonance amplitude, tois the res-\nonance tempo, Œ≤the damping constant and tis the tempo\nvariable. During experimenting, these parameters were Ô¨Åt-\nted to the distribution of the tapped tempi. It has been found\nthat, on average, music experts produce a resonant tempo of\n138 BPM with a damping constant, Œ≤equal to 5.0. In Fig-\nure 3 the produced model, with the use of these parameters\nis depicted.\nIn this paper the model of equation (8) is used to weight\nthe results from the periodicity analysis so that\nw/prime\ni=Ae(Ti)wii‚àà[1,2,...,NT], (9)\n199Poster Session 2\n0 100 200 300 400 500 00.02 0.04 0.06 \nTempi (BPM) Amplitude Figure 3 .

After this step, elements w/prime\niformw/primewhich contains\nthe perceptually modiÔ¨Åed weights of the winning tempi in\nT. The tempo estimation is therefore enhanced with per-\nceptual information.\nSystems that estimate periodicity patterns in a signal stron-\ngly respond to the multiples and aliquots of any fundamen-\ntal periodicity that appears in it. Likewise, when it comes\nto human listeners, the more ambiguities in determining the\ntempo appear due to the selection of multiples and divisors\nof the same tempo. In the vector of winning tempi, T, also\nappear not only possible perceived tempi, but also multiples\nand aliquots of them.\nIn order to discard some ‚Äúfalse‚Äù estimations from Tand\ndecide which is the perceived tempo in a group of tempi\nthat have a common divisor, an extra weighting step is intro-\nduced. During experimenting, it was found that increasing\nthe weights of each tempo that appears in Twith a factor of\nthe weight of its multiples and divisors that also appear in\nT, has the following two desired effects:\na. SigniÔ¨Åcant decrease in the (normalized) weights of\ntempi whose multiples and aliquots are not present.\nb. Highly accurate decision on which is the true per-\nceived tempo within a set of tempi that have the same\ncommon divisor (as presented in Section 3).\nThis factor was chosen experimentally 0.3 for multiple pe-\nriods and 0.6 for aliquots.\n3. EVALUATION AND RESULTS\n3.1 Datasets and Evaluation Measures\nThe developed system is evaluated using the measures pro-\nposed in [5]. The two measures deÔ¨Åned are Accuracy 1 and\nAccuracy 2 , corresponding to the percentage of tempo esti-\nmates within 4% of the ground truth data. For the calcula-\ntion of Accuracy 2 also integer multiplications and divisions\nof the ground-truth tempo are considered to be correct esti-\nmates.Winning\nTempiT1 T2 T3 T4 T5\nAccuracy 1\n(%)38.40 28.22 6.02 1.72 2.44\nAccuracy 1\nCDF (%)38.40 66.62 72.64 74.36 76.80\nTable 1 . The Accuracy 1 of the algorithm for the estimation\nof the winning tempi\nThe results are based in two different datasets, both used\nin [5] for a comparative evaluation of tempo induction algo-\nrithms. That way our results can be compared to previous\nwork. The Ô¨Årst dataset, Ballroom , consists of 698, (30 sec-\nonds long each) audio excerpts. The second dataset, songs ,\ncontains 465 audio excerpts, this time each one being around\n20 seconds long. The two datasets cover a wide range of\ngenres (namely Rock, Classic, Electronica, Flamenco, Jazz,\nAfroBeat, Samba, Balkan, Greek, Cha Cha, Rumba, Samba,\nJive, Quickstep, Tango and Waltz). Both datasets have been\nmade publicly available1. It is mentioned here that due to\nsome missing or bad formatted Ô¨Åles, the following results\nhave been calculated over a subset of the above datasets,\nthat covers the 97.25% of the whole data.\n3.2 Results\nThe Ô¨Årst phase of the evaluation procedure was to check\nthe accuracy of the algorithm in deÔ¨Åning the vector of the\nwinning tempi, T,i.e.before applying the perceptual mod-\nelling. The winning tempi in the vector are placed in de-\nscending order, based on their weight. In Table 1, the results\non the Ballroom dataset are illustrated. In the Ô¨Årst row, the\nAccuracy 1 of the algorithm in each index of the winning\ntempi is shown. The next row, presents the cumulative re-\nsults up to each index of the vector T. As depicted in this\ntable, the algorithm has a success rate of 76.8% in estimat-\ning the correct tempo in the Ô¨Årst 5 estimations.\nThe perceptual model at the end was inspired by this am-\nbiguity in the results. Although the algorithm is quite accu-\nrate in detecting the right periodicity from a music excerpt,\nit has a relatively low percentage (38.4%) to do so in the\nÔ¨Årst guess ( i.e.the tempo with the higher energy). Until this\npoint, only low-level music features have been used. The\nencoding of higher level knowledge on tempo perception in\nthe model could be useful in choosing the right index of the\nwinning tempi vector as the Ô¨Ånal estimation.\nIndeed, the last step of the system achieves this task.

In Figure 4 such a compar-\nison is depicted and the proposed system seems to perform\nwell. Further improvements to the proposed method are en-\nvisioned and these are discussed in the following section.\n4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nA new method to estimate the tempo of musical signals was\npresented in this paper. The evaluation of this method wasconducted using popular datasets for the tempo estimation\ntask along with previously deÔ¨Åned evaluation measures. Al-\nthough at an early stage, the algorithm seems to operate very\nwell in comparison to the state-of-the-art, using only a sin-\ngle frame (4 seconds long) for calculating the result.\nAs mentioned, the above described results are obtained\nfrom a single frame of the input signal. An application of the\nalgorithm on the whole signal, and then the computation of\na median or average tempo estimate did not seem to yield a\nsigniÔ¨Åcant improvement. However, the implementation of a\nvoting mechanism could improve the overall tempo estimate\nof a piece. In such an extension an extra assumption has to\nbe made, i.e.that the tempo of the piece does not present\nany variations throughout the song.\nThe use of adaptive LPEFs introduced by this work, seems\nto work well in the task of extracting tempo estimation fea-\ntures. However, it was observed during experimenting, that\nthe Ô¨Ånal results and success rates are sensitive to the the set\nof parameters used by the feature list extraction part (LPC\norder, peak picking static threshold). A detailed examina-\ntion of the results that are obtained from different parameter\nsets and the determination of an optimum set may further\nimprove the accuracy of the whole system.\nFurthermore, the use of a different set of temporal fea-\ntures that indicate the tempo can be considered in a later ver-\nsion of the algorithm as the literature reveals some promis-\ning alternatives. For example, linear prediction coefÔ¨Åcients\ninstead of the the prediction error have been successfully\nused as features for music genre classiÔ¨Åcation in [9].\nUntil now, the existing knowledge on the perceptual event\nthat leads to the well known action of foot-tapping , has not\nbeen extensively used for a systematic way of estimating\nperceived tempo. This study indicates that taking advan-\ntage of auditory modelling tools can signiÔ¨Åcantly improve\nthe performance of a tempo estimation algorithm.\n5.

INTRODUCTION \nDue to advances in computer and network technologies, the \ndevelopment of efficient multimedia data storage and r e-\ntrieval applications have received much attention in recent \nyears. In the music do main, motivations for  such systems \ncan vary from industr y objectives  such as royalty rights \nmanagement to individual  use such as personal database \norganization, music preference list creation , etc.  Due to the \nwide range of expressive and instrumental variations poss i-\nble in music pieces, in order for such systems to have the \nnecessary performance reliability as to be useful in the i n-\ndustrial domain, m usic variation matching m u s t  b e  a d-\ndressed . A number of challeng es such as feature extraction, \nrepresentation , tempo and key varia bility ,  n e e d  t o  b e  h a n-\ndled with high precision in order to achieve reasonable per-\nformances.  \nTo eliminate the kinds of  differences caused by expre s-\nsive variations  or instrumental arrangements of the same \nmusic piece, researchers have focused on accurately e x-tracting the types of musical content in which such varia-\ntions have minimal or no effect.  \nA considerable amount of research focused on the tran-\nscription of music signal to MIDI or piano roll represent a-\ntion for accurate understandin g of the note sequence of the \nmusic. Numerous researchers have modeled sound events \nwith known machine learning techniques, in order to detect musical notes and their onset and offset times [1,2,3,4 and \n5]. Their results are promising, although  not accurat e \nenough to provide an extension to a general solution for \nmusic variations matching.   \nSince accurate transcription of multi channel audio is not \neasy, a mid level representation of music is desired. Recent \nresearch attempts in [6,7 and 8] showed that diff erent repr e-\nsentation techniques such as extracting the salient  melody \nor a chord progression from the music piece could be a feasible solution s for polyphonic representation since har-\nmonic structure tend s note  to change dramatically with e x-\npressive and ins trumental deviations .  \nOn the other hand, some researchers focused on extract-\ning fingerprints that carr y information about the acoustic \nfeature distribution of the music piece over time. [9 and 10]  \nused chroma based features to directly represent music \npieces, without labeling  and used  simple cross correlation \nof chroma vectors for measuring similarity. Kim also \nadopted delta features that represent general movement in \nthe harmonic structure of music pieces for more accurate \nrepresentation and retrieval [1 1].  \nPickens et. al [13] used existing polyphonic transcription \nsystems in the literature to abstract note features from m u-\nsic audio. The tr anscription was then mapped to the  har-\nmonic domain. A bi-gram (2 -gram) representation, namely \na 24 √ó  24 triad (th ree-note chord ) transition matrix was \nused to represent both the query and the music pieces in the \ndatabase. A  distance metric between an input transition m a-\ntrix and the transition ma trices available in the database \nwas calcu lated to determine  similarity.  \nOur study differs from other researchers ' who use some  \nkind of mid level representation in the similarity metric we \nuse, and in that we use a sliding window approach in our \ntranscription independent of the exact locations of note o n-\nsets and offsets. While  our strate gy loses note level details \nin the audio, it makes our representation more robust  to \n43Poster Session 1\n  \n \nnote transcription errors.  In contrast to the retrieval m e-\nthods reported in  [12 and 13]  we tested our model on not \nonly bi grams but also higher order n-grams , for n up to and \nincluding 6 , and  observed a major boost in the retrieval pe r-\nformance  with increasing Markov chain order .   \nIn later studies, Lavrenko & Pickens [14] used random \nfields to model polyphonic music pieces from MIDI files. \nUsing random fields,  they automatically induced new high \nlevel features from the music pieces , such as consonant and \ndissonant chords, progressions and repetitions, to efficiently model polyphonic music information.  \nThe F-measure , Correct Retrieval Accuracy, and  Mean \nReciprocal Rank are used to measure the performance of \nthe systems available in the literature. The reported results \nvary with respect to the database selected, its size and the \ncomplexity  of the variations available. Since the algorithms \nused are ge nerally computationally expensive, the exper i-\nmental databases tend not to be larger than a couple of \nthousand songs. For a more detailed overview of the sy s-\ntems available in the  literature, please refer to [ 18].   \nMost systems, including the ones described  above,  were \ndesigned assuming the availability of the entire  query and \ntarget  song s from beginning to end. To our knowledge, no \ntests were reported when only short length queries are \npresent. In this work, a mid level tonal representation of \naudio and a s tatistical tonal modeling method for perfor m-\ning retrieval of short length audio queries is proposed.  \nIn order to ensure robust transcription against musical \nvariations, a 3 dimensional Tonal Space (TS), a toroidal  \nversion of the Spiral Array  model  [15] is used. The details \nare explained in Section 2. 12 dimensional Pitch Class Pr o-\nfile (PCP) features are mapped onto the TS and a centroid  \n(center of weight) is calculated in order to find the repr e-\nsentative position of each audio frame in 3D space. A 1 -\nnearest neighborhood classifier is used for identifying the centroid s of each frame with respect to triad chord classes. \nA key and tempo invariant time series of triad chord  label s \nare then acquired , from which we derive n-gram  represent a-\ntions  of each music piece in the database. The similarity \nbetween the extracted triad series and the n-gram models is \ncalculated using the perplexity measure. The flowchart of the proposed system can be seen in Figure 1. The paper \nconcludes with  the explanation of the experimental setup, \nthe results and the discussion on future work.\n \n \n \nFigure 1. Flowchart for the proposed system .  2. TONAL MUSIC SPACE  \nThere exists an illustrious  history  of mathematica l and m u-\nsic theor etic work on  geometric modeling of tonal  relatio n-\nships between pitches , intervals, chords , and keys. A r e-\nview of these models can be found in [ 16].  \nWe u se a toroidal version of the Spiral A rray for a nu m-\nber of reasons.  We are interested in a flexible tonal repr e-\nsentation that combines different tonal features in the same \nspace.   The Spiral Array  clusters tonal objects  that are \nharmonic ally close ; this is especially important for robust \nanalysis of audio without exact transcription.  \nThe model consists of a series of nested helices in three -\ndimensional space. The outermost spiral consists of pitch \nclasses that form  the line or circle of fifths . Pitch classes \nare placed at each quarter turn of the spiral, so that vertical-\nly aligned pitch classes are a major third apart. This net-\nwork of pitches is identical to the neo -Riemannian tonnetz  \nshown in Figure 2.  Pitch classes that are in the same triads  \nare closely clustered, as are those that are in the same key . \nChord representations are generated as weighted combin a-\ntions , a kind of centroid,  of their component pitch classes, \nand key representations are constructed from their I, IV, \nand V chords.  The details and applications of the Spiral \nArray model are explained in [15][ 17]. \n \nFigure 2.  The tonnetz. Perfect 5th, Major  3rd and Minor  \n3rd distances  \nThe Spiral Array model assumes a cylindrical form to \npreserve enharmonic spellings. In contrast, we wrap the \nmodel into a torus so as t o ignore pitch spell ing. The resul t-\ning pitch class torus is shown in Figure 3. The 24 chord \nrepresentations are then  defined by constructing the tria n-\ngle outlined by each chord‚Äôs  root, fifth, and third , and cal-\nculating the centroid of these vertex points . A chord repr e-\nsentation is illustrated in Figure 3.  While the toroid m odel \nno longer has the same kinds of symmetries and invar iance \nin the cylindrical model,  the chord and key regions remain \n4412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nsufficiently distinct for geometric discrimination between \ndifferent chords.  \n \nFigure 3.  Tonal Space: positions of the 12 pitch classes and \nconstruction of the C Maj triad chord using C , G and E.  \n \n3. FEATURE EXTRACTION  \nAs discussed earlier, to overcome the effects of incorrect \ntranscription, we use a mid level transcription approach for \nthe transcription task . The goal is to accuratel y label each \nframe of music audio with major  or minor  triad chords.  For \nthis, we use the tonal  space described  in Section 2. We now \npresent our feature extraction process.  This process is ou t-\nlined in the top row of boxes in Figure 1. \nAudio Input Frames: 250 ms audio frames with 90% \noverlap is used. A large  window with a wide  margin of \noverlap is preferred because our goal is to track the general \nharmonic  movement and not instantaneous local changes  \nthat would be  expected to be sensitive  to variations  in in-\nstruments and expression  and thus pose problems for  the \nretrieval system ‚Äôs similarity calculations.   \nPitch Class Profile: 12 dimensional Pitch Class Profile \n(PCP) features are collected  from each audio frame . The \npitch classes extracted range from  A0 (27. 5 Hz) to A7 \n(3520 Hz). From the PCP's, the note weights are mapped to \npitch class positions in the tonal space, and a centroid  is \ncalculated in 3D space as shown in Fig 4 (red star).  \nChord Labels: The centroid  derived in the fashion d e-\nscribed above  represents a kind of  tonal center of the par-\nticular frame. The system aims to captur e and record the \nmovement of centroids , after they are marked  with the most \nappropriate chord  label . First, the system classifies the  cen-\ntroid  as one of the triads located in the Tonal Space, using a  \nstraightforward 1- NN algorithm , l ik e i n  [15] . The classif i-\ncation boundaries are not calculated from training data, but deterministically defined as described in Section 2.  This \ntranscription strategy compensates for variations  in spectral \ncharacteristics and intensity levels when  the same notes and \nharmonies are played on different instruments.   \n4. N-GRAM  MODEL OF HARMONIC SEQUENCE S \nWe use  n-grams to model the harmonic progressions  of the \nmusic pieces. The output of the feature extraction process is  \nan L length chord sequence . We describe here the normal i-zation process  to make the sequence tempo and key inva-\nriant.  Such normalization is  required because the queries \nand the matching music  in the database may be in different \nkeys and temp i.  \nTo ensure key invariance , relative chord changes are ex-\ntracted from the transcribed sequence, an approach that has \nalso been used by other researchers [ 19].   \n \n \nFigure 4.  Mapping from PCP to the Tonal Space. Calcul a-\ntion of the tonal centroid and its distance to the triad chords.  \nSince the window length and overlap rate is high (250ms  \nand 90%, respectively), the transcription  of the harmonic \nprogression  contains many chord  repetitions. We remov e \nthese repetitions  so as to focus on harmonic  changes , rather \nthan harmonically stable parts  of the music sequence. By \ndoing  so, tempo variations are also  eliminated. The resul t-\ning harmony sequences thus carry more distinct inform a-\ntion about the harmonic  progression.  \nIn our experiments, n-grams were selected for modeling  \nharmonic progressions . Results for different n-grams are \nreported in S ection 6.  The audio coverage range of a 6-\ngram in our experiments is between 0.8 seconds and 2.3 \nseconds. On aver age 1. 5 seconds of music a udio is \nrepresented by  a 6-gram feature set.  \nTo enable the efficient use of this strategy, smoothing of \nthe n-gram models is required . Smoothing  is widely used to \neliminate computational problems caused  by non -existing \nn-grams in natural language processing applications . A \nUniversa l Background Model (UBM) is produced using the \nentire music database and mixed with each individual n-\ngram model using a low weight  for smoothing  (0.9 vs 0.1) . \nFinally, the collection of the smoothed  n-grams constitutes \n45Poster Session 1\n  \n \nour database.  We use the SRILM toolkit [ 20] to create the \nn-gram models, to perfor m smoothing, and to evaluate the \nmodel . \n5. RETRIEVAL  METHOD  \nWe use  the perplexity  measure to evaluate the similarity \nbetween the n-gram model of each music piece in the dat a-\nbase and that of the short -length query sequence. The pe r-\nplexity measure gives the likelihood the query was genera t-\ned by a specific probability distribution, namely one of the \nn-gram harmonic progression models in the database.  \nThe perplexity of a discret e probability distribution p can \nbe defined as:  \n, \nwhere H(p) is the entropy of the distribution. Suppose p is \nunknown. One can model the  unknown distribution p using \na training sample drawn from p. Given a proposed model q, \none can evaluate how successful ly q predicts the sample set \n{x1,x2, x3, ... x N} drawn from p using the perplexity mea s-\nure.  The perplexity of the model q  can be defined as:  \n \n. \nA model q that better predicts the unknown distribution p \ngives higher probabilities of q(x i), which  leads to lower \nperplexity.  \nOur system first builds n-gram models of the query and \nof each piece in the database. It then uses the perplexity measure to determine which of the harmonic progression \nmodels  of the pieces in the database best fits the query s e-\nquence.    The system then returns  an N -best list of the most \nlikely candidates.  \n6. EXPERIMENTS  \nA list of 1000 classical music pieces from famous compos-\ners is selected. For each piece in the list, 2 recordings are \nacquired (one termed the ‚Äú original ‚Äù and  the other a  varia-\ntion). The variation can be a different instrumental ar-\nrangement of the piece  or a recording of the same piece by \nanother artist. We replace the ones for which we cannot \nfind an  additional audio  recording s (CD or mp3) with audio \nsynthesized from the  MIDI version as the variation (about \n250 such MIDI variations  are created ) .   A l l  f i l e s  a r e  c o n-\nverted to 16 kHz 16 -bit wav format. All 2000 files (1000 \noriginal s and 1000 variation s) are converted to strings of  \nchord labels  using the method explained in Section 3. The \noriginal recordings are used to  train n-gram harmonic pr o-\ngression models that constitute the database. The short \nlength test queries are extracted from random parts of each music piece. For each of the query pieces, the system aims  \nto retrieve  the original recording of the target piece in the \nN-best list.   \n  Length of the query  \n  15s 25s 35s Full \nTop-1 \nmatch  Accuracy  37.6 41.6 42.9 51.6 \nMRR  - - - - \nTop-5 \nmatch  Accuracy  55.8 57.4 59.6 63.7 \nMRR  60.4 63.6 67.4 70.1 \nTop-20 \nmatch  Accuracy  56.8 59.6 62.6 71.5 \nMRR  71.8 75.4 73.2 79.8 \nTable 2.

All numbers are above one, indicating that performance improves by increasing the n-gram order. \nIt is interesting to note that t he ratio of the accuracy for n = \n6 over that for n = 5 converges between 1.03 and 1.05 for \nall query lengths. As shown by these numbers, t he perfo r-\nmance difference between 5 -grams and 6 -grams is small \nwith respect to accuracy. This may be  because 5-gram s be-\ncome sufficiently sparse for capturing  the unique harmonic \nfeatures of the music pieces . Thus,  building 6-gram and \nhigher model s will likely not have a strongly positive effect \non retrieval performance for this particular dataset. The tr a-\ndeoff between computation time and retrieval accuracy  \nshould also be a consideration  since building models and \ncalculating perplexity for larger n-grams takes more co m-\nputation al power and time.   \n7. CONCLUSION  \nIn thi s work, a perplexity based  audio music retrieval sy s-\ntem that is robust to instrumental variation is proposed. \nPCP features are ext racted from overlapping frames and \nmapped to a 3-dimension al tonal space. A1 -NN classifier \ndecides the harmonic  identity of the particular frame based \non pre -defined  positions of the 24 major  and minor  triads in \nthe tonal space. Key normalization is performed. From the classifier output, repetitions are removed so as to focus  on \nchanges in the series of harmonies . From the resulting  har-\nmonic  sequence, n-gram statistics are acquired and a  data-\nbase is constructed. Given a music query, the transcription \nis complete d using the same strategy and the similarity b e-\ntween  the transcribed input and the database models is \ncomputed using the perplexity measure.  \nThe algorithm is tested on  a database of 2000 music \npieces. While there is room for improvement, the results \nshow that, for short length queries, the perplexity -based ap-\nproach is capable of  finding the target piece. The work \ncould be strengthened by testing on a larger dataset with more versions of each song.  \nTo our knowledge, no other study in the literature r e-\nports results from short length queries. Our motivation here \nis that royalty rights management systems usually  work \nwith short length queries  and we would like to apply  our \nsystem in such scenarios.  The MRR and top -N best list \nscores suggest that a more fine-grained representation  may \nbe needed in order to more  successfully retrieve the target \npiece. Ideally, we would like a retrieval system for which \nthe target piece top s the results list, an important criterion \nfor royalty rights management  applica tions . \nFuture work includes systematically isolating comp o-\nnents  of our system for evaluation and improvements. We \nhave used a straightforward feature extraction strategy, which should be compared against other methods. We can \nsubstitute chord labeling algorithms in the literature for the  \nparticular method used to extr act harmonic labels  to ex-\namine the impact of chord labeling technique on retrieval \nsuccess.  Other f urther work includes implementing multi \n47Poster Session 1\n  \n \nstage search algorithms, in order to improve search perfo r-\nmance with respect to time and accuracy .  \n8.

INTRODUCTION \nInformation Retrieval (IR) is a highly experimental  \ndiscipline, and IR Evaluation (IRE) experiments are  the \nmain research tool to scientifically compare IR sys tems and \nalgorithms to advance the state of the art through careful \nexamination and interpretation of their results. IR E has been \nused and studied in Text IR for over 50 years now, since the \nCranfield 2 experiments [18], with successful evalu ation \nforums such as TREC, CLEF, NTCIR or INEX. Until 200 6, \nthese evaluations were not usual at all in Music IR  (MIR), \nalthough there was general concern about specific n eeds and \nresources for a fruitful beginning of evaluation ca mpaigns in \nthe Music domain. \nThe ‚ÄúISMIR 2001 resolution on the need to create \nstandardized MIR test collections, tasks, and evalu ation \nmetrics for MIR research and development‚Äù was draft ed and \nsigned by many members of the community as a \ndemonstration of the general concern [20]. A series  of three \nworkshops then followed between July 2002 and Augus t \n2003, were researches begun this long-needed work f or \nevaluation in Music IR [20]. There was some general  \nagreement that evaluation frameworks for Music IR w ould \nneed to follow the steps of the Text REtrieval Conf erence (TREC) [53][56], although it was clear too that spe cial care \nwas to be taken not to oversimplify the TREC evalua tion \nmodel [19], because Music IR differs greatly from T ext IR \nin many aspects that affect evaluations [21]. The g eneral \noutcome of these workshops, and many other meetings , was \nthe realization by the Music IR community that thes e \nevaluations were clearly necessary, and that a lot of effort \nand commitment was needed to establish a periodic \nevaluation forum for Music IR systems. Finally, in 2005 the \nfirst edition of the Music Information Retrieval Ev aluation \neXchange (MIREX) took place, and ever since it has \nevaluated over a thousand Music IR systems for many  \ndifferent tasks on a yearly basis [23]. \nThe impact of MIREX has been without doubt benefici al \nfor the Music IR community, not only for fostering these \nexperiments, but also for studying and establishing  specific \nevaluation frameworks for the Music domain. But now  that \nit is widely accepted, it seems that the community has \nsettled down in the belief that we finally have wha t we \nwanted. It is our belief though, that while we are on the right \npath, there is still a lot of work to do in Music I R \nEvaluation. These experiments are anything but easy  and \nstraightforward [54][26], so much that a whole area  therein \nis concerned with their reliability and correctness : \nInformation Retrieval Meta-Evaluation. The Text IR \nliterature has been flooded with meta-evaluation st udies for \nthe past two decades, showing year after year that IRE has \nits very own issues and proposing different approac hes and \ntechniques to cope with them. While the MIR communi ty \nhas inherited good evaluation practices by adopting  TREC-\nlike frameworks, some are already outdated, and oth ers still \nlack appropriate analyses. We agree that not everyt hing \nfrom the Text IR community applies to Music IR, but  a lot \nof meta-evaluation studies do. In fact, since the i nception of \nMIREX in 2005 several landmark studies have taken p lace \nin the context of TREC, specially focused on large- scale \nevaluation, robustness and reliability, none of whi ch has \neven been considered for Music IR.  \nIn this paper we approach meta-evaluation from the point \nof view of the analysis of experimental validity of  IR \nEvaluation experiments. We show different aspects o f IRE \naffected by these validity considerations, and surv ey the \nText IR literature outlining how these problems are  dealt \nwith in evaluation forums such as TREC. Finally, we  show \nthe current shortcomings in MIR evaluation and prop ose \nlines for further work, as a starting point for wha t we hope \nbegins a tradition of periodic Music IR Evaluation studies.  \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or  part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee pr ovided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit o r commercial advantage and that \ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on th e first page. \n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n609Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\n2.  IR EVALUATION \nIR evaluation experiments follow the traditional Cr anfield \nparadigm conceived by Cleverdon in the late 50‚Äôs [1 8]. The \nmain element needed for these evaluations is a test  \ncollection, which is made up of three basic pieces:  a \ndocument collection, a set of information needs and  the \nrelevance judgments telling what documents are rele vant to \nthese information needs (the ground truth or gold s tandard). \nThese test collections are built in the context of a particular \ntask defining the intent of the information needs, and several \nmeasures are used to rank the systems following dif ferent \ncriteria, always from the point of view of a user m odel with \nassumptions and restrictions as to the potential re al users of \nthe systems being evaluated.  \nAlthough some variations exist, a typical IRE exper iment \ngoes as follows [54][26]. First, the task is identi fied and \nwell-defined, normally seeking the agreement betwee n \nseveral researchers. Depending on the task, a docum ent \ncollection is either put together or reused from an other task, \nand a set of information needs is selected, often g iven as \ndirect input queries. The systems to evaluate retur n their \nresults for the particular query set and document c ollection, \nand these results are evaluated using several measu res that \nattempt to assess how well the systems would have s atisfied \na real user. This assessment employs the relevance \njudgments in the ground truth, made before or after  running \nthe systems, depending on the task and other factor s. \n3.  IR META-EVALUATION \nExperimental validity establishes how well an exper iment \nmeets the well-grounded requirements of the scienti fic \nmethod [30][35][36]. That is, whether the results o btained \ndo fairly and actually assess what the experimenter  \nattempted to measure. Validity of experiments is us ually \nassessed from different points of view, depending o n what \naspects of the scientific method are at stake. \n \nTask  \nUser model  \nDocuments  \nQueries  \nGround truth  \nSystems  \nMeasures  \nConstruct  x x     x \nContent  x x x x  x  \nConvergent   x   x  x \nCriterion     x x  x \nInternal    x x x x x \nExternal    x x x x  \nConclusion   x  x x x x \nTable 1. The effect of Experimental Validity on Information \nRetrieval Evaluation experiments. \nInformation Retrieval Evaluation experiments, as \nscientific experiments themselves, are also subject  to \nvalidity analysis. Meta-evaluation can be viewed as  the \nanalysis of this experimental validity, highlightin g that the \nevaluation is itself being evaluated. Next, we disc uss several \ntypes of experimental validity and show how they af fect IR \nevaluation experiments (see Table 1). 3.1  Construct Validity \nConstruct validity evaluates the extent to which th e \nvariables of an experiment correspond to the theore tical \nmeaning of the concept they purport to measure. For  \nexample, an experiment to assess the quality of the  results \ngiven by a Web search engine would not have constru ct \nvalidity if quality were measured as the number of visits to \nthe site, because this actually measures its popula rity. Thus, \nan experiment acquires construct validity by thorou gh \nselection and justification of the variables used. \nIn the case of IRE, construct validity is concerned  mainly \nwith the evaluation measures and the user model con sidered \nfor the particular task [16]. For instance, in a tr aditional ad \nhoc retrieval task, binary set-based measures such as \nPrecision and Recall do not resemble a real user wh o wants \nnot only relevant documents, but highly relevant on es at the \ntop of the results list [42]. Instead, rank-based m easures \nsuch as Average Precision , graded relevance judgments \n[52][31], or the combination [29], are more appropr iate. \n3.2  Content Validity \nContent validity evaluates the extent to which the \nexperimental units reflect and represent the elemen ts of the \ndomain under study. For example, an experiment meas uring \nthe reading comprehension of students would not hav e \ncontent validity if only science-fiction stories we re \nemployed. Thus, an experiment acquires content vali dity by \ncareful selection of the experimental units include d. \nIn IR evaluation, it is imperative that the task re sembles \nas closely as possible the real-world settings it r epresents, \nand that the systems evaluated fulfill as much as p ossible the \nneeds of the real users. However, evaluating under such \nconditions would introduce a heavy user component v ery \ndifficult to manage and control, so a more system-o riented \napproach is usually followed [54][18]. As such, the  actual \nvalue of the systems in real settings is many times  \noverlooked [34], and sometimes it can be questioned  [45]. \nLikewise, the documents in the collection must rese mble \nas closely as possible the documents that would be found in \na real-world setting of the task, and have a suffic iently large \nsample so as to be representative of the domain. Al so, the \nparticular queries used should be carefully selecte d to \nrepresent a diverse and wide range of possible use cases, \nwhile being reasonable for the document collection in use \n[54][12]. Moreover, some queries are more helpful t han \nothers to differentiate between systems [25][38]. \n3.3  Convergent Validity \nConvergent validity evaluates the extent to which t he results \nof an experiment agree with other results, theoreti cal or \nexperimental, they should be related with. For exam ple, the \nresults of a study measuring the mathematical skill s of \nstudents should be correlated with other studies on  abstract \nthinking. Thus, an experiment acquires convergent v alidity \nby careful examination and confirmation of the rela tionship \nbetween its results and others supposedly related. \n61012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nGround truth data is a much debated part of IR eval uation \nbecause of the subjectivity in the very concept of relevance. \nSeveral studies show that documents are judged diff erently \nby different people in terms of their relevance to some \nspecific information need, even by the same people over \ntime. As such, the validity of IRE experiments can be \nquestioned because different results are obtained d epending \non the people that make the relevance judgments. Se veral \nstudies have shown that absolute figures do indeed change, \nbut the relative differences between systems stand still for \nthe most part [51]. For very large-scale experiment s though, \nthese differences can have a large impact on the re sults [13]. \nEffectiveness measures are usually categorized as \nprecision- or recall-oriented. Therefore, it is exp ected for \nprecision-oriented measures to yield effectiveness scores \ncorrelated with other precision-oriented measures, and \nlikewise with recall-oriented ones. However, this d oes not \nalways happen [39][31], and some measures are even better \ncorrelated with others than with themselves [57], e videncing \npredictability problems. In general, all these meas ures \nshould be correlated with user satisfaction in the particular \ntask [42], so alternatives such as rank-based measu res, \ndifferent forms of ground truth data [4] or relevan ce \ndiscount functions [29] are usually considered. \n3.4  Criterion Validity \nCriterion validity evaluates the extent to which th e results of \nan experiment are correlated with those of other ex periments \nalready known to be valid. For example, a study to evaluate \nif a new product would have as good sales as an old  one \nwould lack criterion validity if subjects were just  asked \nwhether they like the new one, instead of whether t hey like \nit even more: the context changed in the second cas e. Thus, \nan experiment acquires criterion validity by carefu l \nexamination and confirmation of the correlation bet ween its \nresults and others previously established. \nAs real-world systems need to manage more and more \namounts of information, modern IR evaluation studie s have \nfocused on practical large-scale methodologies, mai nly \nthrough a technique called pooling [8]. This permit s the use \nof large collections while requiring somewhat reaso nable \neffort in relevance judging by assuming that docume nts not \nretrieved by any system are indeed not relevant. Mo re recent \nstudies analyze the use of non-experts for relevanc e judging \n[3], crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechani cal \nTurk [1][17], requiring fewer judgments to give an estimate \nof the absolute effectiveness scores of the systems  [59][60], \nselecting what judgments better tell the difference  between \nsystems [10][11], or even using no relevance judgme nts at \nall [44]. All these improvements allow for an incre ase on \ncontent validity as the effort per query diminishes . The \nresults of all these methodologies are usually comp ared with \nthe results of traditional ones, in terms of criter ion validity, \nto see whether they are really viable or not. That is, whether \nthe results they produce not only require less effo rt, but also \nagree with those of previous, accepted methodologie s. 3.5  Internal Validity \nInternal validity evaluates the extent to which the  \nconclusions of an experiment can be rigorously draw n from \nthe experimental design followed, and not from othe r factors \nunaccounted for. For example, a study on the usabil ity of \ntwo word processors would not have internal validit y if the \nsubjects were already familiar with one of the prod ucts. \nThus, an experiment acquires internal validity by c areful \nidentification and control of possible confounding variables \nand selection of experimental designs. \nIn IR evaluation, observed differences between syst ems \ncould be the result of the particular people that d o the \nrelevance judgments, as their personal notion of re levance \ncould be more beneficial for some systems than for others \n[13], let alone if the ground truth data has incons istencies. \nLikewise, if a pooling method were used, systems mo re \nalike would reinforce each other, while a system wi th a \nnovel technology would not be able to contribute th at much \nto the pool: it is more likely for the former syste ms to have \nmore of their documents included in the pool than f or the \nlatter [62]. In general, the non-relevancy assumpti on affects \nboth the measures [40] and the overall results [9].   \nThe particular queries used could also be unfair if  some \nsystems were not able to fully exploit their charac teristics. \nThis is of major importance for machine learning ta sks \nwhere systems are first tuned with a training colle ction: if \nthe query characteristics were very different betwe en the \ntraining and evaluation collections, systems could be \nmisguided. On the other hand, if the same collectio ns were \nused from year to year, an increase in performance could be \njust due to overfitting and not to a real improveme nt [54]. \nAlso, some evaluation measures could be unfair to s ome \nsystems if accounting for information they cannot p rovide. \n3.6  External Validity \nExternal validity evaluates the extent to which the  results of \nan experiment can be generalized to other populatio ns and \nexperimental settings. For example, a study on the effects of \nsome cancer treatment would not have external valid ity if \nmost patients in the sample were teenage males, as it would \nnot be clear what the effect of the drug is in, say , elder \nwomen. Thus, and experiment acquires external valid ity by \ncareful experimental design and justification of sa mpling \nand selection methods. \nThis is probably the weakest point of IR evaluation  [54]. \nAs mentioned, it is very important that the documen t \ncollection and query set is representative of the d omain \nbeing studied. On the other hand, having large coll ections \nmeans that the completeness of the ground truth is \ncompromised: it is just not feasible to judge every  query-\ndocument pair [8][62]. As mentioned, the usual solu tion is \nto pool the first k results of the participating systems and \njudge only those, assuming that all others are not relevant. \nThis is an obvious problem because the very test co llection \n(documents, queries and ground truth), which is in its own a \nproduct of the experiment, might not be reusable fo r \n611Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nsubsequent evaluations of new systems [14][15]. The  \nvalidity of the latter experiments could be comprom ised. \nLikewise, it is not justified to compare two system s \nevaluated with different test collections, because the results \nin each case are very dependent on the query set, r elevance \njudgments, measures, etc. [6][54]. Indeed, it is kn own that \ndifferent systems can perform very differently when  \nevaluated with different collections, especially if  machine \nlearning techniques are involved. This highlights t he lack of \nexternal validity in IRE experiments, and the impor tance of \nalways interpreting the results in terms of pairwis e system \ncomparisons rather than absolute performance figure s [54]. \nThat is, comparisons across collections and claims about the \nstate of the art based on a single collection, are not justified. \nNonetheless, very rough comparisons between two sys tems \nacross collections could be made if reporting the r esults of \nwell-established baseline systems for those collect ions and \ntheir relative difference with the systems of inter est [2]. \n3.7  Conclusion Validity \nConclusion validity evaluates the extent to which t he \nconclusions drawn from the results of an experiment  are \njustified. For example, a study might claim that pe ople has \nbetter access to the Internet in China than in the U.S. \nbecause there are more users connected, when in fac t the \npercentage of people connected, over the total popu lation, is \nmuch less. Thus, an experiment acquires content val idity by \ncareful selection of the measuring instruments and the \nstatistical methods used to draw de grand conclusio ns. \nTwo important characteristics of the effectiveness \nmeasures used in IR Evaluation are their stability and \nsensitivity. The results should be stable under dif ferent \nconditions, such as relevance judgments made by dif ferent \npeople or different sets of queries, so the results  do not  vary \nsignificantly and alter the conclusions as to what systems \nare better [7]. Also, they are desired to discrimin ate between \nsystems if they actually perform differently [55][3 9], and to \ndo so with the minimum effort [41]. Likewise, they are \ndesired to not discriminate between systems that ac tually \nperform very similarly. Note that these performance  \ndifferences must be considered always in the contex t of the \ntask and its underlying user model. \nGiven a set of systems and the scores they obtained  for \ndifferent queries according to some measure, they a re \nusually compared in terms of their mean effectivene ss score. \nNot until recently, statistical methods have been \nsystematically employed and analyzed to compare sys tems \nby their score distribution rather than just their mean score \n[43][58]. At this point, it is very important to in terpret \ncorrectly the results and understand the very issue s of \nhypothesis testing; and most importantly, distingui sh \nbetween statistical and practical significance: eve n if one \nsystem is found to be significantly better than ano ther one, \nthe difference might be extremely small to be notic ed by \nusers. In fact, the tiniest practical difference wi ll turn out \nstatistically significant with a sufficient number of queries.  4.  CHALLENGES IN MUSIC IR EVALUATION \nResearch in IR follows a cycle that ultimately lead s to the \ndevelopment of better systems. First, in the Develo pment \nphase researchers build a system for a particular t ask, and to \nassess how good it is, there is an Evaluation phase . Once the \nexperiments are finished, researchers then enter a phase of \nInterpretation of the results, which leads to a pha se of \nLearning why the system worked well or bad and unde r \nwhat circumstances. Finally, with the new knowledge  \ngained researchers get into an Improvement phase to  try and \nmake their system better, going back over to the Ev aluation \nphase. Unfortunately, current evaluation practices in Music \nIR seem to fall short in this cycle. \nDevelopment.  The task intent and its underlying user \nmodel are sometimes unclear or its real-world appli cability \nuncertain. For instance, is it realistic that while  the queries \nto the Query by Humming task are in audio format, t he \ndocument collection is in symbolic form? Or, in the  \nsimilarity tasks, is it realistic that the queries are actual \nitems contained in the collection? Likewise, are 30  second \nclips realistic for all tasks? \nEvaluation.  Several tasks, such as Audio Chord Detection \nor Symbolic Melodic Similarity, use document collec tions \neither too small or biased toward some genre or tim e period \n[46][48], which jeopardizes the validity of the res ults. \nMoreover, the lack of standardized and public colle ctions \nresults in research groups using their personal, pr ivate, often \nundescribed and rarely analyzed collections, which \nprecludes other researchers to compare systems or v alidate \nand replicate results, hindering the overall develo pment of \nthe field and often leading to wrong conclusions. I n this line, \nthe lack of standard evaluation software that all r esearchers \ncan use, thus minimizing the likelihood of bugs and  \nincorrect results, should be addressed too, especia lly with \nnew or undocumented measures specific of Music IR. \nInterpretation.  Some effectiveness measurers, such as \nNormalized Recall at Group Boundaries, are used wit hout \ndescription, references or source code, making them  \nimpossible to interpret or use in private evaluatio ns. Also, \nwidely-accepted baseline systems are very rarely in cluded in \nevaluations, and when they are, they use to be impl emented \nas random systems, having no useful value as a lowe r bound \nto which compare new systems. Another point that ne eds \ndiscussion is the set of statistical procedures use d, or the \nlack thereof. Given the small-scale evaluations usu ally \ncarried out in the Music IR field, it is imperative  that \nstatistical significance procedures be used, and ce rtainly that \nthe ones used are thoroughly selected and analyzed,  for \nwrong conclusions can easily be drawn from incorrec t \nprocedures or incorrect interpretation [50]. \nLearning.  When the results of an evaluation experiment \nare calculated and interpreted, the next step would  be to \nfigure out what happened and for what reasons. But there is \na great problem here: most of the times the raw mus ical \nmaterial is not available to experimenters, the act ual queries \nused are unknown, and not even their characteristic s are \n61212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\npublished. Researchers cannot analyze the evaluatio n results \nand improve their systems: if they had very bad res ults for \nsome queries, there is no way of knowing why. They can \nonly use their private collections over and over ag ain, \nultimately leading to overfitting and misleading re sults. \nImprovement.  There is another reason why researchers \nare forced to use their private collections all alo ng: current \ntest collections put together in collective evaluat ion forums \nare hardly reusable. As seen, the incompleteness of  ground \ntruth data depends largely on the number of partici pating \nsystems, and with the current low participation lev el, a new \nsystem would be highly penalized with the collectio n as is. \nThe reusability is of course null if these data wer e not \npublicly available, as happens with some tasks. As such, \nresearchers have no option but to blindly improve t heir \nsystems and wait for another evaluation round, with  no way \nof comparing cross-edition results due to the lack of data. \n5.  OPPORTUNITIES IN MUSIC IR EVALUATION \nAlthough not easily, these shortcomings of current \nevaluation practices in Music IR can be overcame. T o this \nend, we list several proposals to ease the way thro ugh the IR \nresearch and development cycle. \nCollections.  The document collections need to be large, \nmove beyond the handful of songs currently being us ed in \nseveral tasks; and try to include heterogeneous mat erial in \nterms of genre, time period, artist, etc. This is n ot hard to \nachieve, but when making such a collection open to other \nresearchers, copyright issues immediately arise [21 ]. A \npossibility is to publish feature vectors and metad ata, such \nas in the recent Million Song Dataset [5], although  this still \nposes problems if researchers wanted to study a new  feature \nor analyze specific items for which their system wo rked \nbetter or worse. In any case, these collections sho uld be \nstandard and used throughout the community, across tasks if \npossible, for a better comparison and understanding  of the \nimprovements between systems. \nRaw Data.  For a successful execution of the Learning \nand Improvement phases, raw musical material is nee ded. \nAn alternative is to use music free of copyright re strictions, \nsuch as that provided by services like Jamendo, but  the \npossible biases this might introduce are subject fo r further \nresearch. In this line, the use of artificial mater ial, such as \nsynthesized or error-mutated queries, should be rev ised [37]. \nEvaluation Model.  Having publicly accessible and \nstandardized collections would allow for a change i n the \ncurrent execution model employed in MIREX. Research ers \ncould be in charge of executing their systems and p roducing \nthe runs to submit back to MIREX, relieving them fr om a \ngood deal of workload and bringing researchers relu ctant to \ngive their algorithms away to third parties. This d ata-to-\nalgorithm model is used in the recent MusiCLEF foru m \n[32], and in fact it is the only viable way of movi ng to large \nscale evaluations, not only in terms of data but al so in terms \nof wider participation. The current algorithm-to-da ta model \nis in our view unsustainable in the long run, let a lone if IMIRSEL finally stops receiving funds [24], and pla tforms \nlike MIREX-DIY under NEMA [61] would still not perm it a \nfull execution of the IR cycle. \nOrganization.  The current organization of MIREX rests \nheavily on the IMIRSEL team, who plan, schedule and  run a \ngood number of tasks each year. We propose a 2 nd  tier \norganization below, for each particular task, and b y leading \nthird-party researchers. These organizers would dea l with all \nthe logistics, planning, evaluation, troubleshootin g and so \non, diminishing the workload of IMIRSEL, which woul d act \nas a sort of steering meta-organization tier provid ing the \nnecessary resources and general planning. This is t he format \nsuccessfully adopted by major Text IR forums like T REC or \nCLEF, which has helped in smoothing the process and  \ndeveloping tasks to push the state of the art in ea ch edition. \nSpecific Methodologies.  Both new methodologies \n[46][48][27][22] and effectiveness measures [47] ha ve been \nproposed for Music IR tasks, needing meta-evaluatio n \nstudies in the near future to keep improving the ev aluations. \nSome work has studied the reduction of effort neede d to \nevaluate through the use of crowdsourcing platforms  \n[49][33], and further studies should follow this li ne given \nthe usual restrictions the Music IR field has as to  availability \nof resources. Another line is the study of human ef fects on \nground truth data and evaluation results [28]. \nOverview Publications.  The organization proposal would \nalso benefit the community if by the end of each MI REX \nedition the organizers published an overview paper \nthoroughly detailing the process followed, data, re sults, and \ndiscussion to boost the Interpretation and Learning  phases. \nSuch a publication would be the perfect wrap-up to the \nparticipant-papers that describe the systems but ra rely \ninvestigate and elaborate on the results. In fact, many of \nthese participant-papers are not even drafted.  \nSoftware Standardization.  It is not rare to find incorrect \nevaluation results due to software bugs. With the \ndevelopment and acceptance of a software package to  \nevaluate systems we would gain in reliability withi n and \nbetween research groups, speeding up experiments an d \nguiding novice researchers. Also, it would further serve as \ndocumentation of the measures and processes used, f or the \nimplementation of some details is unknown or subjec t to \ndifferent interpretations; and it would call for th e \nstandardization of data formats to speed up the IR cycle.  \nBaselines.  The establishment of baseline systems to serve \nas a lower bound on effectiveness would help in ass essing \nthe overall progress in the field. With the standar dization of \nformats, public software, public collections of raw  music \nmaterial and the supervision of task-specific organ izers, the \ninclusion of baselines in these experiments would g reatly \nbenefit the execution of the IR cycle and the measu rement \nof the state of the art. \nCommitment.  In general, the current problems of Music \nIR Evaluation need to be acknowledged by researcher s. \nNow that we have a well-established evaluation foru m like \nMIREX, we need to start questioning the validity of  the \n613Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nexperiments, with the sole purpose of making them b etter \nand more striking. Current IR experiments seem to s top at \nthe Evaluation phase of the IR cycle, but the next phases are \noften ignored or impossible to engage into. \n6.  CONCLUSIONS \nWe have presented a survey of the Text IR literatur e on \nstudies tackling the problem of IR Evaluation exper iments. \nFrom the point of view of the analysis of experimen tal \nvalidity, this survey shows different aspects of IR  \nEvaluation that have been overlooked and need speci al \nattention in the Music IR domain. From the point of  view of \nthe IR research and development cycle a researcher follows \nin Music IR, we have also shown that current evalua tion \npractices force researchers to stop early in the cy cle. \nEvaluation experiments release good amounts of numb ers \nand plots, but there is a lack of proper interpreta tion and \ndiscussion due in part to the lack of public and st andardized \nresources, usually leaving researchers blind to imp rove their \nsystems. In this line, several proposals are made t o engage \nresearchers in these last phases of the cycle, whic h should \nultimately lead to a more rapid development of the field. \nWe hope this paper makes the case for MIR Meta-\nEvaluation studies and the fact that they are  actual MIR \nresearch, playing a central role in which researche rs should \nengage to begin a tradition of evaluation articles in ISMIR. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Alonso et al., Can We Get Rid of TREC assessors ?

INTRODUCTION \nOne of the most important tasks in Music Informatio n Re- \ntrieval is Audio Music Similarity and Retrieval (AM S). \nAlong with Symbolic Melodic Similarity (SMS), AMS i s \none of the traditional tasks evaluated in the annua l Music \nInformation Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) [ 3], \nand one of the tasks that most closely resemble a r eal-world \nmusic retrieval scenario. A music similarity retrie val system \nreturns a ranked list of music pieces deemed to be similar to \na music piece given as a query. In the case of the MIREX \nevaluation of AMS, these music pieces are 30 second  audio \nclips of music material. \nAs of the writing of this paper, a total of 41 AMS systems \nhave been evaluated in 4 editions of MIREX from 200 6 to \n2010, and it is again planned for 2011. In these ev aluations, \na set of queries is randomly selected and provided to the \nparticipating systems, which then return the corres ponding 5 \nmost similar music pieces in a music collection. To  evaluate \nthe effectiveness of the systems two things are nee ded: rele- vance judgments and effectiveness measures. The rel evance \njudgments are scores given to each query-candidate pair, \nrepresenting their similarity. Two relevance scales  are used \nin MIREX for both the AMS and SMS tasks. The Broad \nscale has three levels: not similar (NS = 0), somew hat simi- \nlar (SS = 1) and very similar (VS = 2). The Fine sc ale uses \nreal valued scores between 0.0 (not similar at all)  and 10.0 \n(identical). As to the effectiveness measures, in A MS the so-\ncalled Sum measure is used, while more complex meas ures \nwere developed for the SMS task [11]. \nThe grand results of these evaluations are pairwise  com- \nparisons between the participating systems, indicat ing which \nis better and whether the difference is statistical ly significant \nor not. When drawing such conclusions, two characte ristics \nof the evaluation must be kept in mind: power and s tability. \nPower refers to how powerful the evaluation is to e stablish a \nsignificant difference between any two systems (i.e . it is \nconcerned with Type II errors). If A is concluded to perform \nsignificantly better than B, the evaluation is considered \npowerful. If the difference were not statistically significant, \nno clear conclusion could be drawn from the experim ent: A \nand B could actually perform identically (very unlikely) , or \nthe evaluation conditions might have not been suffi cient to \nobserve a difference large enough (most likely). As suming \ntwo systems A and B are never exactly the same, an option \nto achieve significance is to increase the number o f queries, \nthough this has obvious limitations in terms of eff ort and \ncost [16][8]. The difference between practical and statisti- \ncally significant differences must be considered if  doing so. \nStability refers to how reliable a result is when c laiming a \nstatistically significant difference between two sy stems (i.e. \nit is concerned with Type I errors). If A and B were evaluat- \ned with a set of queries and the result were that A is signifi- \ncantly better than B, the expected result with a completely \ndifferent (and independent) query set would therefo re be \nthat A is again significantly better than B. If it were not, it \nwould be an indication that the evaluation is not s table when \ndifferentiating between systems. These conflicts do  appear \nin IR evaluation experiments, and if the query set used is too \nsmall, the effectiveness measures not appropriate o r the sta- \ntistical procedures not suitable, they can be frequ ent [1]; \neven when statistical significance is involved [15] . \nIn this paper we analyze the power and stability of  the \nAMS evaluation methodology when concluding that a s ys- \ntem A is significantly better than a system B.

For thi s study we \ndecided to use the MIREX 2009 Audio Music Similarit y \nand Retrieval data, as it is the largest dataset av ailable to \ndate [4]. A total of 15 systems by 9 different rese arch groups \nwere evaluated with a total of 100 queries. The top  5 docu- \nments retrieved by each system were evaluated for e ach \nquery using the Broad and Fine scales, and the Sum measure \nwas used with these two sets of relevance judgments  to as- \nsess the effectiveness of the systems. The Friedman  test was \nran with a Tukey‚Äôs HSD post-hoc correction procedur e to \nlook for significant differences. The grand results  of the \nevaluation are thus 105 pairwise comparisons betwee n sys- \ntems, some of which are statistically significant. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sect ion 2 \nreviews previous work on the analysis of power and stability \nin TREC and related studies on the evaluation of mu sic sim- \nilarity tasks. Next we discuss the effectiveness me asures \nconsidered, and Sections 4 and 5 present the result s of the \npower and stability analysis. Section 6 argues and analyzes \nthe use of different statistical procedures. Finall y, Section 7 \npresents a discussion of the results and the paper then fin- \nishes with the conclusions and lines for further wo rk.  \n2.  RELATED WORK \nThe stability of effectiveness measures has been ex tensively \nstudied in the context of the Text REtrieval Confer ence \n(TREC). Buckley and Voorhees first studied the stab ility of \nseveral measures, observing conflicts between 1% an d 14% \nof the times, depending on the measure, when compar ing \nany two systems [1]. They then studied the sensitiv ity of \nseveral measures as a function of the query set siz e, and they \nconcluded that absolute differences larger than 0.0 5 (about \n25% relative difference) are necessary for sets of 50 queries \nto assure a conflict ratio below 5% [16], confirmin g the reli- \nability of TREC evaluations for using 50 queries as  a mini- \nmum. However, none of these studies considered the effect \nof using statistical significance techniques when c omparing \ntwo systems. Sanderson and Zobel somehow filled thi s gap \nby studying the effect of several statistical proce dures on the \nsensitivity, and they concluded that virtually any relative \ndifference of 10% or more, coupled with statistical  signifi- \ncance, will not produce a conflict in other experim ents [8]. \nSakai reviewed most of this work with different dat a sets \nand with other, more recent measures [7]. With larg er query \nsets, Voorhees found that even significant differen ces could \nstill be conflictive [15]. However, the study of po st-hoc sta- \ntistical procedures was not part of any of these st udies. \nMeta-evaluation studies are very rare in Music IR [ 12], \nand to our knowledge the power and stability issues  have \nnot yet been studied for MIREX data. Nonetheless, s ome \nworks have addressed similar problems with Music IR  eval- \nuation experiments concerning the similarity tasks.  Typke et \nal. studied alternative forms of relevance judging for the SMS task [10], and they came up with a specific eff ective- \nness measure to be used with them [11]. Urbano et a l. then \nshowed how to make the evaluation more reliable whe n \nusing those relevance judgments [13]. Jones et al. studied \nthe relevance judgments made for the SMS and AMS ta sks, \nfocusing on the effect of having different people d o the \njudgments and with different scales. To reduce the cost of \njudging, the use of crowdsourcing platforms such as  Ama- \nzon Mechanical Turk has been studied by Urbano et a l. for \nthe SMS task [14], and by Lee for the AMS task [6].  In this \npaper we focus on the power and stability of the MI REX \nAMS evaluations, employing techniques similar to Bu ck- \nley‚Äôs and Voorhees‚Äô, but with some modifications sp ecific \nto the AMS task and the post-hoc analysis used in M IREX. \n3.  EFFECTIVENESS MEASURES \nThe MIREX AMS evaluation campaigns use just one mea s- \nure to assess the effectiveness of the participatin g systems. \nThis is the so-called Sum measure, which is the ave rage \nrelevance of the retrieved results. When used with the Broad \njudgments, this measure is often called PSum; and w hen \nused with the Fine judgments, it is called FINE [3] . \nThe Audio community has traditionally been reluctan t to \nadopt more complex measures, even some specifically  de- \nsigned for this type of tasks [3]. In this paper we  study the \nuse of several of these measures in the Audio Music  Simi- \nlarity task, and their impact on the power and stab ility of the \nevaluation. First, we review the measures considere d. \n3.1  Average Gain \nThis measure is based on the concept of information  gain \nprovided by the retrieved documents. This informati on gain \nis usually represented by the relevance level assig ned to the \ndocument, assuming that the larger the score, the m ore in- \nformation is gained by the user. \nG@k is the Gain of the k-th document retrieved, and \n1@ @ k\niCG k G i ==‚àë  is the Cumulated Gain of the first k \ndocuments retrieved [5]. Thus, the Average Gain of the top-\nk documents is calculated as the mean: \n 1@ 1 @ @ k\niCG k AG k G i k k == = ‚àë  (1) \nThis is the official measure used in the MIREX AMS task. \nWe prefer to use this definition based on informati on gain \nfor consistency with the other measures. \nThe problem of G, CG and AG is that they do not hav e a \nfixed upper bound, which causes some problems when aver- \naging the results across queries. Consider a query q1 for \nwhich there are 7 VS documents and another query q2 with \n2 VS and 5 SS documents. For q1 a perfect system can \nachieve a total CG@5 score of 10, while for q2 the maxi- \nmum possible is 7. Apparently, the system performs better \nfor q1, when in reality it returns ideal results for both  que- \nries. As with other simpler measures such as Precis ion, this \nlack of fixed upper bound makes them less stable [1 ][7]. \n59812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n3.2  Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain \nAG does not consider the rank at which documents ap pear \ndown the results list: a document at rank 3 provide s as much \ngain as if it were at ranks 1 or 5. However, a high ly relevant \ndocument is clearly more useful to the user if it a ppeared \ntoward the top of the list. To model this usefulnes s, the gain \nscores are discounted as they appear later in the r esults list. \nA logarithm function with base b is used, and so the Dis- \ncounted Cumulated Gain is defined recursively as: \n @\n@ @@( 1) log bCG k k b \nDCG k G k DCG k k b k< Ô£±\nÔ£¥=Ô£≤‚àí + ‚â• Ô£¥Ô£≥ (2) \nAlso, to avoid the lack of fixed upper bound proble m, it \nis considered what the ideal ranking of documents w ould be: \n@ @ .. : @ @( 1) IDCG k DCG k st i k G i G i = ‚àÄ < ‚â• + . Divid- \ning the DCG@k score of the system by the ideal IDCG @k, \nthe upper bound is always 1, meaning perfect retrie val: \n @@@DCG k NDCG k IDCG k =  (3) \nThis measure is called Normalized Discounted Cumula t- \ned Gain [5], which has been shown to be particularl y stable \nand sensitive [7][17]. For this study we set the lo garithm \nbase to the standard b=2 . \n3.3  Average Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain \nThe last measure of the information gain family we consider \nhere is the Average Normalized Discounted Cumulated  \nGain, which is calculated as the average NDCG score  \nthroughout the retrieved list: \n 11@ @ k\niANDCG k NDCG i k==‚àë  (4) \nANDCG provides more information about the ranking o f \nthe retrieved documents, as still quite large NDCG scores \ncould be achieved just by highly relevant documents  to- \nwards the end of the list. Like NDCG, this measure has been \nshown to be particularly stable and sensitive [7]. \n3.4  Average Dynamic Recall \nThe last measure we consider originated in the cont ext of \nthe MIREX 2005 SMS task and the evaluation with rel e- \nvance judgments in the form of partially ordered li sts \n[10][13]: Average Dynamic Recall [11]. ADR was spec ifi- \ncally designed for level-based relevance judgments without \na scale fixed beforehand, and ever since it is one of the main \nmeasures used in MIREX SMS with the Broad judgments . \nWe also define ADR in terms of information gain. Le t \n1,..., n I I I =‚å© ‚å™ be the list of n judged documents ordered by \ndescending relevance level (i.e. an ideal ordering) , and let \n1,..., k R R R =‚å© ‚å™ be the list of the top k ‚â§ n  retrieved docu- \nments ordered by rank. The set Ai of allowed relevant doc- \numents at rank i is defined as: \n 1{ ,..., } { : @ @ } i i j A I I I j i G j G i = ‚à™ > ‚àß =  (5) that is, the union of all previous ideal documents and those \nwith lower rank but equal information gain (i.e. sa me rele- \nvance level). The final score is then calculated as : \n 1\n1{ ,..., } 1@k\ni i \niA R R ADR k k i =‚à©=‚àë  (6) \nwhich is the average across ranks of the ratio of d ocuments \nretrieved that are actually in the ideal ranking. T his measure \nis widely used by the SMS community, but it has nev er been \nused in the AMS task, nor has it been analyzed in t erms of \npower or stability. In this paper we do so. \n4.  EVALUATION POWER \nTo assess the effect of different effectiveness mea sures and \nrelevance scales on the power of the evaluation, we  compute \nthe number of pairwise system comparisons that resu lt sig- \nnificant according to the Friedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD (FT)  pro- \ncedure used in MIREX. We evaluate the original meas ure, \nAG, as well as NDCG, ANDCG and ADR; both with the \nBroad and Fine set of relevance judgments, for a to tal of 8 \ndistinct measures. \nWe study the trend for increasing query sets of siz es 5 to \n100, with increments of 5 queries each. To diminish  random \neffects when selecting a subset of queries for the 5 to 95 \nsizes, we choose 500 random samples in each case. T hus, \nthere are 52,500 system pairwise comparisons for ea ch \nmeasure and query subset size. Also, the queries in  MIREX \nwere balanced across music genres: the 100 original  queries \nwere selected from 10 different genres, with 10 que ries per \ngenre. We also reproduce this balance, using strati fied sam- \npling with equal priors when making query subsets. There- \nfore, our samples are also balanced across music ge nres, \nemulating as closely as possible a real MIREX evalu ation. \nAs Figure 1 shows, 57% of the results were signific ant \nusing AG Broad  and 54% using AG Fine  (horizontal dotted \nlines). We omitted query subset sizes below 40 for clarity: \nthe curves follow a somewhat logarithmic trend (see  the \nthumbnails for the whole plot). Indeed, it can be s een that \nthe increment in significant pairwise comparisons i s very \nsoft and quite similar for all measures but ADR Fine . \nThe right figure also shows that for larger query s ets \n(A)NDCG Fine  clearly outperform AG Fine , which seems to \nconverge. ADR Fine  performs quite poorly, following a \nsomewhat linear trend. This is expected though, as the con- \ntribution of each document retrieved is here binary : if a doc- \nument is allowed at rank i it contributes 1¬∑ik + to the score, \n0 otherwise. In the (A)NDCG Fine  measures the contribution \nis discounted, but it is never binary. This makes A DR Fine  \nperform significantly worse. Nonetheless, it is imp ortant to \nnote that ADR was not intended for real valued rele vance \njudgments, which make it very difficult for two doc uments \nto have the same relevance score (right term in Equ ation 5) \nand thus it requires systems to obtain a nearly ide al ranking. \nMost importantly, it can be seen that the query set  size \ncould be significantly reduced to lower the cost of  the eval- \n599Oral Session 6: Databases and Evaluation\nuation in terms of relevance judging effort. For ex ample, \nhaving reduced the query set to 70 queries (70%) on ly 2 \nsignificant differences would have been missed if u sing \nAGBroad , none if using AG Fine . \n5.  EVALUATION STABILITY \nTo assess the effect that different effectiveness m easures \nand relevance scales have on the stability of the e valuation, \nwe need two different query sets, as if we were eva luating \nthe systems with two completely different collectio ns. Un- \nfortunately, having the same 15 systems with anothe r 100 \ncompletely different queries is not yet feasible. N onetheless, \nwe can use smaller query sets and then observe the trends to \nextrapolate to larger sets. We start with the 5,000  random \nquery subsets of sizes 5 to 50 used before. Then, f or each of \nthese we sample another query subset of the same si ze, \nagain stratified, but also without replacement. Tha t is, for \neach of the 500 trials of each of the 10 query subs ets, there \nare two query samples with no common query. Because  they \nare disjoint, we can treat them as if coming from t wo differ- \nent evaluation experiments. Note also that having a  total of \n100 queries limits the query subsets to 50 queries at most, as \nthe paired subset samples would contain the remaini ng 50 \nqueries in each case. \nWe re-evaluate the 15 systems for with each pair of  query \nsamples, and then compare the 105 system pairwise r esults \nfrom both samples. We count the number of times the re is a \nsignificant difference with one sample but not with  the other \none, again according to the original Friedman-Tukey ‚Äôs HSD \nprocedure. These would represent stability conflict s across \ntwo real evaluations. \nAs Figure 2 shows, about 4% of the system pairwise \ncomparisons are conflicting with the Broad judgment s using \n40 queries or more, and as few as 3% with the Fine judg- \nments (dotted horizontal lines). This is consistent  with the \n5% significance level set for the statistical proce dure (see \nSection 6). Indeed, the curves tend to converge tow ard the \nend. It is noticeable again that ADR performs signi ficantly \nworse, especially for the Fine judgments, where the  increas- \ning conflict rates can be explained by the very low  sensitivi- \nty of the measure, as explained before. The other m easures \nbehave remarkably similarly. The peaks for small query subsets are explained by the \npower of the statistical procedures used: with that  few que- \nries the tests are not powerful enough to result si gnificant, \nand when they happen to do for one query sample the y still \ndo not for the other one. This increment in conflic ts starts \ndecreasing and converges because the tests get more  power- \nful with larger samples, so they are able to give s ignificance \nwith both query subsets. In fact, for AG with 50 qu eries all \nconflicts are caused by this lack of significance i n one of the \nsamples, 99.9% for NDCG and 99.7% for ANDCG; even \n99.7% for ADR Fine . Most importantly, there was no case \nwhatsoever where the two system pairwise comparison s \nwere significant but with opposite sign. As such, o ne can be \nquite confident about the difference between two sy stems \nwhen it comes up significant. \n6.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS \nThe usual method to check whether two systems are s ignifi- \ncantly different or not is to run a statistical tes t such as the \nWilcoxon test or the t-test. Each of these has an a ssociated \nsignificance level, which is the maximum allowed pr obabil- \nity of committing a Type I error. In our case, thes e errors \noccur when the test says there is a significant dif ference but \nthere actually is none. This significance level use s to be set \nto Œ±=0.05 or Œ±=0.01. That is, a probability of 5% or 1% of \nincorrectly getting significant differences between  systems. \nIn the case of MIREX 2009 AMS, 105 of these pairwis e \ntests would need to be run. Unfortunately, if setti ng Œ±=0.05 \nthe probability of committing a Type I error in any  of these \nwould be 1-(1-Œ±)105 =0.995. This is the experiment-wide sig- \nnificance level. Thus, almost certainly we would at  least \nonce be saying that two systems are significantly d ifferent \nwhen they actually are not. In MIREX, the Friedman test is \nrun instead, with the Tukey‚Äôs HSD post-hoc procedur e for \nsignificance correction [3]. This compares all syst em pairs \nat once, with the difference that the experiment-wi de signif- \nicance level remains close to Œ±=0.05. The test is thus much \nless likely to fail in one comparison, at the cost of being \nmuch more conservative and give fewer significant r esults \nin the first place [9]. Finally, we also note that while the \nFriedman test is used because it does not assume no rmality \nof the score distributions, Tukey‚Äôs HSD does assume  it. Figure 2.

We should at this  point \nconsider whether this is what we want. From the poi nt of \nview of the participants, what they are interested in is the \nsubexperiment  of comparing their system with the other 14, \nand the remaining 91 pairwise system comparisons ar e ra- \nther uninteresting for them. Therefore, why not per form \nthese simple 14 pairwise comparisons? The subexperi ment-\nwide significance level would be 1-(1- Œ±)14 =0.512. Most \nimportantly, note that the number of pairwise syste m com- \nparisons grows quadratically in the whole experimen t but \nlinearly in the subexperiments. As such, for evalua tions with \nmany more systems the power would decrease drastica lly if \nusing Friedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD. \n6.1  Evaluation Power \nHere we perform the same experiment as in Section 4  and \nwith the same query subsets, but instead of using F riedman-\nTukey‚Äôs HSD we perform the 105 pairwise system comp ari- \nsons using 1-tailed Wilcoxon tests at the Œ±=0.01 significance \nlevel (W1). Therefore, the probability of committin g a Type \nI error for the complete experiment (in any of the 105 sys- \ntem comparisons) is 1-(1- Œ±)105 =0.652, but for the subexper- \niments (14 system comparisons in each one) it is dr amatical- \nly reduced to 1-(1-Œ±)14 =0.131. \nFigure 3 shows as expected that many more significa nt \ndifferences are found between systems: as much as 2 0% \nmore (the horizontal dotted lines mark the power ac hieved \nby the original evaluation). Interestingly, the dif ference be- \ntween AG and (A)NDCG is here more acute, and it get s \nlarger as more queries are used. The plots also sug gest that \nW1 with about half the queries can achieve the same  or bet- \nter power levels as the original evaluation with FT . \n6.2  Evaluation Stability \nAs expected, with simple Wilcoxon tests there are m any \nmore significant differences, but how many of them are ac- \ntually caused by mere Type I errors? We have shown that \nthe probability of having at least one incorrect re sult is very \nhigh, so next we look into stability. \nAs Figure 4 shows, the stability levels are very si milar. \nAG again converges at about 3.5% of stability confl icts, and \nit does so much earlier than in the original evalua tion. Most notably, (A)NDCG show here more stability conflicts , con- \nverging to about 6%. Note that the peaks observed f or small \nsubsets are here narrower because the statistical t ests are \nmore powerful in the first place. Again, ADR perfor ms \nworse, especially for the Fine judgments. \n7.  DISCUSSION \nTaking a close look at the power and stability resu lts, one \nmay wonder whether it is necessary to use as many a s 100 \nqueries. From a pragmatic point of view, we have ar gued \nthat simple 1-tailed Wilcoxon tests are more useful  to the \nMIREX participants than Friedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD. Next,  we \nshow analytically that they are even more reliable and \ncheaper (see Table 1). \n 50 queries 100 queries \n Power  Conflicts  Stable Power Stable \nAG Broad (FT) 52.4%  3.6% 48.8% 57.1% 53.5% \nAG Fine (FT) 51.9%  3.2% 48.7% 54.3% 51.1% \nAG Broad (W1) 55.1%  3.7% 51.4% 59.0% 55.4% \nAG Fine (W1) 54.3%  3.3% 51.0% 60.0% 56.7% \nTable 1. Power and stability for 50 and 100 query sets when  using \nFriedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD (FT) or 1-tailed Wilcoxon test s (W1). \nFor instance, with AG Fine  and 50 queries 51.9% of the \n105 pairwise comparisons are significant according to FT, \nbut 3.2% have a stability conflict. Thus, 48.7% of the com- \nparisons are both significant and stable. Assuming the ap- \nparent convergence of conflicting results, for 100 queries \nthere would be 51.1% significant and stable results . But also \nwith 100 queries, W1 is even more stable, and with as little \nas 50 queries it is as reliable as FT with the full  query set, \nhaving 51.0% of significant and stable results. (A) NDCG \nshow very similar results, with differences of abou t 2%. \nWe note again that very few of these conflicts are caused \nby a change in the sign of the difference between s ystems, \nand never is it found significant for both query sa mples. \nIndeed, 97.3% of the conflicts with AG were caused by \nmere lack of statistical power in one of the paired  query \nsamples, 96.7% with NDCG and 95.9% with ANDCG. \nAgain, this indicates that if significance is found , it most \nprobably is correct.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nWe have analyzed the MIREX Audio Music Similarity a nd \nRetrieval task in terms of power and stability of t he evalua- \ntions, studying four effectiveness measures (AG, ND CG, \nANDCG and ADR) with the two traditional sets of rel e- \nvance judgments employed in MIREX (Broad and Fine).  \nAbout 55% of the pairwise system comparisons come u p \nstatistically significant with current practices, w ith all \nmeasures but ADR behaving very similarly. The incre ase in \npower follows a logarithmic trend with the number o f que- \nries used, so merely using more queries to achieve signifi- \ncance does not pay off at some point. As to stabili ty, we \nobserved that about 4% of the pairwise system compa risons \nare unstable: with one test collection the differen ce would \nbe significant, but with a different collection it would not. \nHowever, less than 0.14% of these conflicts had a s wap in \nthe sign of the difference, and in no case was a si gn swap \ncoupled with significance in both query samples: at  worst, \nthey were too small to observe significance in both  evalua- \ntions. This indicates that if a significant differe nce is found \nbetween two systems, experimenters can be very conf ident \nthat the result is indeed correct and general. \nFrom the pragmatic point of view of a MIREX partici - \npant, we argue that the Friedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD proced ure \nused to measure significance is not appropriate. In  fact, \ncomparing all system pairs with simple 1-tailed Wil coxon \ntests at the Œ±=0.01 significance level we can obtain even \nmore reliability. Most importantly, we have shown t hat with \nthis procedure the query set can be cut in half, an d yet the \nreliability of the results would be as good as if u sing all 100 \nqueries and Friedman-Tukey‚Äôs HSD. This effectively reduc- \nes to 50% the effort needed for relevance judging, which is \nespecially appealing both for in-house evaluations with little \nresources and for the continuity of MIREX, given it s recent \nfunding issues [2]. Some of the spare effort could even be \ndedicated to the evaluation of more queries in the SMS task. \nFuture work will examine other test collections, us ed \nboth in audio and symbolic similarity retrieval. We  believe \nthat the similar behavior observed for AG, NDCG and  \nANDCG is due to the small evaluation depth: only th e top 5 \nresults per system are judged for relevance. Using \n(A)NDCG with the standard logarithm base 2, as we d id, \ntakes advantage of the ranking only beyond the seco nd doc- \nument retrieved. Just the top 5 documents might be too few \nto note the difference, so we also plan to study th e effect of \nevaluation depth in power and stability. The effect  of the \nnumber of systems is also subject for further resea rch, as it \naffects not only the statistical procedure but also  the evalua- \ntion of other systems through the discovery of more  relevant \nmaterial. Indeed, we expect to find different patte rns when \nevaluating systems by the same research group as op posed \nto systems by different groups. The ultimate goal o f looking \ninto these factors with more data is to come up wit h a model \nthat allows us to draw some rules of thumb to guide  experi- \nmenters in the tradeoff between reliability and cos t.

        "abstract": "Emotional content is a major component in music. It has long been a research topic of interest to discover the acoustic patterns in the music that carry that emotional information, and enable performers to communicate emotional messages to listeners. Previous works looked in the audio signal for local cues, most of which assume monophonic music, and their statistics over time. Here, we used generic audio features, that can be calculated for any audio signal, and focused on the progression of these features through time, investigating how informative the dynamics of the audio is for emotional content.

It has\nlong been a research topic of interest to discover the acous-\ntic patterns in the music that carry that emotional informa-\ntion, and enable performers to communicate emotional mes-\nsages to listeners. Previous works looked in the audio signal\nfor local cues, most of which assume monophonic music,\nand their statistics over time. Here, we used generic au-\ndio features, that can be calculated for any audio signal,\nand focused on the progression of these features through\ntime, investigating how informative the dynamics of the au-\ndio is for emotional content. Our data is comprised of pi-\nano and vocal improvisations of musically trained perform-\ners, instructed to convey 4 categorical emotions. We ap-\nplied Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM), that models both\nthe instantaneous sound qualities and their dynamics, and\ndemonstrated the strength of the model. We further showed\nthat once taking the dynamics into account even highly re-\nduced versions of the generic audio features carry a substan-\ntial amount of information about the emotional content. Fi-\nnally, we demonstrate how interpreting the parameters of the\ntrained models can yield interesting cognitive suggestions.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThere is a general agreement that music (especially instru-\nmental music) lacks clear semantic information but conveys\nrich emotional content. As a form of non semantic commu-\nnication, musical performers are able to convey emotional\nmessages through the sound and listeners are able to in-\nterpret the sound and Ô¨Ågure out the emotional intention of\nthe performer. What are the patterns in the musical sig-\nnal itself that enable this communication? The properties\nof the musical content that are responsible for carrying this\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.emotional information have long been the subject of inter-\nest and research. In previous computational research that\nanalyzed emotions expressed in music performance, some\nworks looked for local acoustic cues, such as notes per sec-\nond,articulation degree , etc., that are present in the sound\nand may play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in conveying the emotional\nmessage [1,2]. Statistics of these cues over time were calcu-\nlated and were usually used to train a discriminative model.\nCalculations of these local cues from raw audio data usually\nrely on intermediate signal processing algorithms to detect\nnote onsets and other events, and these intermediate calcu-\nlations may introduce assumptions, errors and bias. In ad-\ndition, such cues are often deÔ¨Åned for monophonic music,\nand are sometimes even designed for speciÔ¨Åc instruments.\nWhile such analysis methods may be very useful for musical\ntraining and acquiring performance skills of conveying emo-\ntions, they tend to be very speciÔ¨Åc. Other works avoid this\nproblem by using generic audio features, such as MFCCs or\nother spectral features. Such generic audio features are de-\nÔ¨Åned in a more straight forward way than sophisticated local\ncues, and don‚Äôt require intermediate signal processing cal-\nculations. Although these features may not describe certain\nperceptual properties that the local cues try to capture, pre-\nsumably they will be more robust. In addition, generic audio\nfeatures don‚Äôt assume anything on the signal, and can be ap-\nplied to any audio signal, even if it contains polyphonic mu-\nsic and even multiple instruments. Such audio content will\nbe a serious obstacle for the local cues approach. Several\nsystems that participated in the MIREX evaluation apply\nthe same audio features for different Music Information Re-\ntrieval (MIR) tasks [3, 4]. In those systems running average\nand standard deviations of time varying audio features were\ntaken, but same as in the local cues approach, the complete\ndynamics of the audio wasn‚Äôt used. Such methods disregard\nthe order of time points and assumes they‚Äôre independent.\nIn the presented work, we suggest an approach that ad-\ndresses both the issues of speciÔ¨Åcity and dynamics. We\napply generic audio features (Mel frequency spectrum) to\novercome the speciÔ¨Åcity problem. The dynamics issue is re-\nsolved by using Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM) [5]. DTM\nwas designed to model both the instantaneous properties of\n747Poster Session 6\nhappy sad angry fearful total\npiano 8 7 7 6 28\nvocal 12 12 12 12 48\ntotal 20 19 19 18 76\nTable 1 .

This model en-\nables us to capture important information that resides in the\ncourse of change of the audio through time, which is missed\nwhen assuming independence among time points.\nSimilar dynamic systems were used by Schmidt and Kim\n[6] to model the time-varying distribution of emotional state\n(in 1 sec intervals). Here we regard each musical instance\n(improvisation of about 30 seconds) as conveying a single\nemotional message (described simply by an emotional ad-\njective), and we apply the dynamic system on the lower level\nof the time-varying audio features themselves.\nDTMs and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) have been\napplied to music information retrieval systems, including se-\nmantic tags of emotional categories annotated by listeners as\nbeing relevant for popular songs [7, 8], but not yet applied\nto audio recordings speciÔ¨Åcally created to convey emotional\ncontent. The data in the presented work has recordings of\nimprovisations by musically trained performers instructed\nto convey speciÔ¨Åc emotions.\n2. METHODS\n2.1 Data\nOur data set is comprised of 76 audio recordings of musi-\ncally trained performers (2 pianists and 2 vocalists, 1 fe-\nmale and 1 male in each category). For each recording the\nperformer was instructed to improvise a short musical seg-\nment that will convey to listeners in a clear manner a single\nemotion , one from the set of {happy ,sad,angry ,fearful}.\nThese emotional instructions were used as the ground truth\nlabels for the recordings (3 judges veriÔ¨Åed that the appropri-\nate emotions are expressed. Future analyses will also regard\nratings from a larger group of listeners as labels). These\nimprovisations clearly rely, in part, on well entrenched cul-\ntural musical norms and even clich ¬¥es. Thus we obtained a\nrelatively wide variety of acoustic manifestations for each\nemotional category, which presumably capture the various\nstrategies and aspects of how these speciÔ¨Åc emotions can be\nconveyed in Western music. The distribution of recordings\nover emotions and instrument is detailed in Table 1. The\nmedian duration for a recording was 24 seconds.2.2 Audio features\nMel spectrum features were collected: for each time frame\nDiscrete Fourier Transform was calculated and the energy\nof the frequency components was integrated in overlapping\nfrequency bins, in a Mel scale, and the 10log10of the bins‚Äô\nenergies were saved. Similarly to [7] we used 34 Mel fre-\nquency bins (partitioning the band from 20Hz to the Nyquist\nfrequency, 11kHz, to 34 Mel-scaled bins), and used half\noverlapping time frames of 2048 samples (after re-sampling\nthe audio data to 22,050Hz, this results in a feature vector\nevery 46msec).\n2.3 Modeling the dynamics\nIn order to model the dynamics of acoustic properties of\nthe music, we applied the Dynamic Texture Mixture (DTM)\nmodel. DTM was previously used to model dynamic tex-\ntures of video [5] and of audio [7]. A Dynamic Texture\n(DT) is a generative model for a time sequence of observed\nfeatures (e.g. the acoustic features collected for each short\ntime frame), that assumes that the observed feature vector\ny(t)was generated as a linear transformation (plus additive\nGaussian noise) over an internal state - a hidden vector vari-\nablex(t)(possibly in a much smaller dimension than the\nobserved feature vector). It also assumes the dynamics of\nthe hidden variable is a Linear Dynamic System, driven by\nadditive Gaussian zero-mean noise: the state of the hidden\nvariable at any time point x(t)depends only on its state in\nthe previous time point x(t‚àí1), and the dependency is lin-\near./braceleftbiggxt=Axt‚àí1+vt\nyt=Cxt+wt(1)\nWherevtandwtare both random normal variables (drawn\nindependently for each t). A DTM is a mixture of DTs,\neach having a different relative weight. The DTM models\nthe generation of an audio instance (a song) as follows: for\neach segment of the song Ô¨Årst select a DT out of the mixture\n(according to the weights of the DTs), and then generate the\nobserved acoustic features of the segment from the selected\nDT.\nSince this is a generative model, we can calculate the\nlikelihood of a song (or of a collection of songs) given a\nDTM. This facilitates the ranking of songs according to their\nlikelihood of being generated by a given DTM or the rank-\ning of different DTMs according to the likelihood of a song\nof being generated by them. The parameters of a DTM can\nbe learned from training data, using an iterative Expectation\nMaximization algorithm tailored for learning DTMs (EM-\nDTM) [5].\nFor each of the 4 emotions ( happy ,sad,angry andfear-\nful), sequences of 125 consecutive feature vectors were col-\nlected (in order to get many feature sequences to train on,\n74812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nwe used overlapping sequences, with hop of 15 feature vec-\ntors from sequence to sequence) from all the recordings in\nthe training set that were associated with the emotion, and\na DTM to represent that emotion was trained over these se-\nquences. Since each feature vector represented a time frame\nof about 46msec, the resulting sequences represented seg-\nments of about 5.7 seconds. The median number of se-\nquences collected for a recording was 26. We used DTMs\nwith 4 components (4 DTs), and with dimension of 7 for\nthe hidden variable x(unless the observed features were in\na lower dimension).\n2.4 Performance evaluation\nIn order to evaluate the success of the acoustic features to\nrepresent the required information regarding the emotional\ncontent, and the success of the model to capture the relevant\nacoustic patterns for the emotional content, we used infor-\nmation retrieval framework and performance measures: Af-\nter training 4 emotion DTMs on the training set, a test set\nwith unseen recordings was analyzed. For each recording\nthe 4 emotions were ranked according to the likelihood of\nthat recording given the 4 emotion DTMs, and annotation\nof 1 emotion (the one with highest likelihood) was given to\nthe recording. For each emotion, the test recordings were\nranked according to their likelihood given the DTM of the\nemotion, as a retrieval task. Comparing the machine‚Äôs anno-\ntation and retrieval to the ground truth emotion labels of the\ntest recording, 3 annotation measures and 2 retrieval mea-\nsures were calculated, in a similar manner to [7]: preci-\nsion (portion of the ground truth labeled instances out of the\nmachine-annotated instances), recall (portion of the machine-\nannotated instances out of the ground truth labeled instances),\nf-measure (balance measure between precision and recall),\nmean average precision - MAP (average precision over dif-\nferent thresholds of ‚Äùhow many of the top-ranked instances\nto retrieve‚Äù) and area under ROC curve - AROC (area under\nthe tradeoff curve of true-positive rate vs. false-positive rate\nfor the retrieval task, area of 0.5 being chance and area of 1\nbeing maximum possible). Each of the 5 measures was cal-\nculated for each emotion, and then averaged over emotions.\nTo estimate these measures over general unseen data, 10-\nfold cross validation scheme was used. For each partition,\n4 emotion-DTMs were trained over 9/10 of the recordings,\nand the 5 measures were calculated over the remaining 1/10\nof the recordings. In each partition control performance\nmeasures (chance level) were approximated by repeatedly\n(400 times) generating random uniform values (instead of\nthe likelihood values actually calculated with the trained\nmodels) and feeding them to the annotation-retrieval sys-\ntem, for the test set. Mean and standard deviation over repe-\ntitions were collected as reference for assessment of quality\nof the actual performance scores. Approximated p-values\nwere then calculated to each of the 5 measures, as the prob-precision recall F MAP AROC\nscore 0.6446 0.6500 0.6000 0.8099 0.8692\nchance 0.25 0.25 0.22 0.44 0.50\np-val 0.09 0.04 0.06 0.02 0.02\nTable 2 .

Finally we averaged over the 10\nfolds the 5 performance measures, as well as 5 chance level\nscores and 5 p-values for our scores. The partition to 10\nfolds was semi random, making sure each fold contained in-\nstances from all 4 emotional categories, and all experiments\nwere done using the same partitioning to 10 folds, in order\nfor the comparison to be consistent.\n3. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n3.1 Experiment 1 - basic\nThe system was applied to the basic features as described\nabove. The results of the cross validation are presented in\nTable 2. In the basic experiment, the results demonstrate\nthat the DTM model manages to capture the important acous-\ntic patterns for the communication of emotion.\n3.2 Experiment 2 - power dynamics\nIn order to investigate the role of the power dynamics, two\ncomplementary manipulations over the features were per-\nformed:\nEx2.1: Ô¨Çattening the power . For each recording, all\nthe Mel spectra vectors were normalized to have the same\nconstant total power, but within each vector, the original ra-\ntios among the frequency bins were preserved. This ma-\nnipulation Ô¨Ålters out the power dynamics (in time scales\nlarger than 46msec), and keeps all the rest of the information\nstored in the original features (melody, timbre, etc.).\nEx2.2: keeping only the power dynamics . For each\nrecording and for each time point, instead of keeping 34 co-\nefÔ¨Åcients, only 1 coefÔ¨Åcient is kept - the total power of the\ntime frame (in log scale). This manipulation preserves only\nthe power dynamics, and Ô¨Ålters out the rest of the sound\nproperties. Since the observed features in every time frame\nwere then only 1 dimensional, the dimension of the hidden\nvariablexwas also reduced to 1, resulting in a linear dy-\nnamic system that is almost degenerate (since the transition\nmatrixAis simply a scalar), and relies more on the driving\nnoise.\nEx2.3: not modeling dynamics . As control, using the\nsame features as in Ex2.2 we applied a GMM model that\nassumes independent time frames, to see if we can still cap-\nture the remained relevant information about the emotions,\n749Poster Session 6\nprecision recall F MAP AROC\nEx2.1 score 0.6134 0.6375 0.5775 0.7627 0.8429\np-val 0.07 0.04 0.05 0.04 0.02\nEx2.2 score 0.4287 0.4625 0.3801 0.5935 0.6879\np-val 0.19 0.14 0.18 0.16 0.14\nEx2.3 score 0.2931 0.3125 0.2638 0.5536 0.6454\np-val 0.44 0.4 0.42 0.29 0.25\nTable 3 . Results for power manipulations.\nwhile disregarding the dynamics. The only dependency left\namong time frames was the 1stand 2ndtime derivatives\n(delta and acceleration) of the feature vector (of the power\nscalar, in this experiment) that were augmented, so the fea-\nture vector here was 3 dimensional (for time t:power (t),\ndelta (t) =power (t+1)‚àípower (t)andacceleration (t) =\ndelta (t+ 1)‚àídelta (t)). For training we used the hierar-\nchical EM algorithm for GMM (HEM-GMM), as described\nin [8]. We used 4 components (4 Gaussians) for each model\n(each GMM), and restricted to diagonal covariance matri-\nces.\nResults are presented in Table 3 (the reference chance\nlevels, which appear in Table 2, are the same in all exper-\niments). Ex2.1 demonstrates that most of the information\nabout the conveyed emotion is retained even without the\ngross dynamics of the power (keeping in mind that some\nÔ¨Åner power dynamics can be expressed inside each time\nframe, in the lower frequency bins). Although this may\nsuggest that the gross power dynamics doesn‚Äôt carry much\ninformation about the emotions, Ex2.2 shows the contrary:\nafter reducing the features to only the power dynamics, the\nscores remain fairly high (although, as expected for a 1 di-\nmensional time function, some decrease in performance is\nevident). The results show that the power dynamics does\ncarry useful information about the emotional content. The\ncontrol done in Ex2.3 shows that GMM got very poor scores\nfor the 3 annotation performance measures, and relatively\npoorer results than DTM (Ex2.2) for all measures. It is quite\nexpected that when reducing the features to only the power,\ntreating the time frames as independent will yield insufÔ¨Å-\ncient information about the emotions. The gap between the\nresults of Ex2.2 and Ex2.3 shows the added value of taking\ninto account the dynamics of the acoustical properties (when\neven 1stand 2ndtime derivatives are not enough).\n3.3 Experiment 3 - avoiding frequency correlations\nWhen acoustical instruments (or human voice) are playing,\nthe harmonic structure has correlations between the funda-\nmental frequencies and their higher harmonics, resulting in\ncorrelation between the dynamics of different frequency bins,\nand suggesting redundancy when all these frequency bins\nare speciÔ¨Åed. The DTM model deals with this redundancy\nby trying to Ô¨Ånd a lower representation in the hidden state\nxthat generates the observed vectors (by linear transforma-precision recall F MAP AROC\nEx3.1 score 0.5288 0.5667 0.4847 0.7331 0.7969\np-val 0.23 0.13 0.19 0.13 0.1\nEx3.2 score 0.4701 0.4375 0.3648 0.6213 0.6546\np-val 0.14 0.16 0.21 0.16 0.21\nEx3.3 score 0.1718 0.175 0.1339 0.4354 0.5425\np-val 0.67 0.65 0.69 0.51 0.4\nTable 4 .

We wanted to reduce the\nobserved features prior to summarizing the whole spectrum\nand, in a way, to overlook the correlations among frequen-\ncies. For this purpose we examined limiting our view to only\npart of the spectrum. We focused on two opposite extremes\nof the spectrum captured by the original features:\nEx3.1: 6400Hz-11025Hz (Nyquist frequency) . Keep-\ning only the last 6 frequency bins of each time frame. Such\nfrequency band is likely to contain resonating frequencies to\nthe fundamental frequencies of the melody being played (or\nvoiced). When calculating mean over all time frames in all\ninstances in the data set, these 6 bins carry only 0.036 of the\npower (not log power) of the spectrum.\nEx3.2: 0Hz-275Hz . Keeping only the Ô¨Årst 3 frequency\nbins of each time frame. For part of the time frames this\nfrequency band may be below the present fundamental fre-\nquency of the tones being played. These 3 bins carry (in\naverage) 0.25 of the power of the spectrum. For both Ex3.1\nand Ex3.2 we used dimension of 3 for the hidden variable x.\nThese extreme bands probably behave differently for piano\nand for vocal and interesting insights can later be raised by\nperforming similar experiments separately for instruments.\nEx3.3: not modeling dynamics . Similar to the control\ndone in Ex2.3, we applied the GMM model to the features\nused in Ex3.2, plus 1stand 2ndtime derivatives.\nResults are presented in Table 4. Ex3 demonstrates that\nin both extremes of the spectrum, there are small frequency\nbands that still carry a fair amount of information about the\nconveyed emotions (performance is still relatively far from\nchance level). The control in Ex3.3 that, again, shows poor\nresults with the GMM (performance being about chance level\nor worse), afÔ¨Årms that the remained relevant information\nlies mostly in the dynamics.\n3.4 Experiment 4 - melodic structure\nNext we aimed to examine the affect of the melodic dynam-\nics on the conveyed emotions. Since it is neither simple\nnor accurate to determine the notes that were played, espe-\ncially for polyphonic music (such as our piano recordings),\nwe chose to deÔ¨Åne a more accurate property that hopefully\nwill be more robust: the dynamics of the strongest frequency\nbin. We cannot claim to describe the perceived melody\n(or the played notes) with this property (since pitch percep-\n75012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nprecision recall F MAP AROC\nscore 0.4322 0.4375 0.3852 0.58 0.6863\np-val 0.23 0.2 0.21 0.2 0.16\nTable 5 .

However this property is eas-\nily computed and can be used as a surrogate marker for\nthe melodic progression. For this experiment, in each time\nframe only the strongest bin remained active and the power\nof all the other frequency bins was nulliÔ¨Åed. Furthermore, to\nget rid of the power dynamics, the power of all time frames\nwas set to be constant, so the only remaining information\nwas the identity of the activated bin in each time frame. The\ndimension of the hidden variable xwas set to 1. Results are\nshown in Table 5. Although the features were reduced to a\nlarge extent, a predictive ability is still present.\n3.5 Interpreting the trained models\nAfter validating that DTMs can capture important acous-\ntic patterns for emotional content, we wanted to understand\nthe differences between different trained emotion models\nthat enabled the system to discriminate. Using a genera-\ntive model is suitable to describe the process of production:\nthe performers that want to convey some emotion and apply\nan appropriate generative strategy to create their resulting\nsound. In order to get insight about the different generative\nstrategies, one needs to compare the learned parameters of\nthe trained models. For this purpose we retrained 4 emotion\nDTMs over the entire data set, for our different experiments.\nThe main component that describes the dynamics of the\nsystem in a DT is the transition matrix A. If the system\nwere a deterministic linear dynamic system, without the ad-\nditive noise, this transition matrix would tell both the des-\ntination of the state of the system xand the way it will\ntake to get there. The eigenvectors of Adescribe the dif-\nferent modes of the system - different patterns of activating\nthe observed features. The eigenvalues of A(complex num-\nbers) indicate the course of progress of the different modes\n(patterns) of the system: while having an eigenvalue with\nmagnitude larger than 1 results in the state of the system di-\nverging, having an eigenvalue with magnitude of 1 results\nin the state converging to either a stable state or stable limit\ncycle determined by the eigenvector of that value, and hav-\ning all eigenvalues with magnitudes smaller than 1 results\nin a system that strives to converge to the zero vector state\n(if there is no additive noise to reactivate the modes). The\nmagnitude of an eigenvalue indicates the intensity or stabil-\nity of this mode (how slowly this mode will decay or how\nmuch anti-mode noise needs to be added to this mode in or-\nder to silence it). The angle of the eigenvalue indicates the\nFigure 1 . Eigenvalues for using the basic features (Ex1).\nEach different shape represents 20 eigenvalues of transition\nmatrices from DTs of a different emotion DTM (5 largest\neigenvalues from 4 DTs per emotion-DTM). happy - circle,\nsad- star, angry - triangle, fearful - square.\nnormalized frequency of the mode - if an eigenvalue has a\nlarge angle its mode will oscillate and modulate its pattern\nin a fast period, returning to the original modulation pattern\n(only with smaller magnitude) after only few time frames.\nThe maximal normalized frequency will be œÄ, making the\nmode change to its exact negative in each consecutive time\nframe. We examined the eigenvalues of the different DTs\nof the different emotion DTMs, and presented their magni-\ntudes (intensity) and angles (frequency).\nIn both conditions presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 there\nis a clear concentration of the eigenvalues of the sadmodel\n(marked with star) with relatively high intensities and low\nfrequencies (in absolute value). This can be interpreted as\na general strategy (either conscious or subliminal) of the\nperformers to convey sadness using stable and slowly mod-\nulated acoustic patterns. On the opposite, the happy and\nangry models (marked by circle and triangle, respectively)\ninclude many modes with smaller intensities and higher fre-\nquencies, suggesting strategies that include fast repetitions\nof acoustic patterns (high frequencies) and easy switching\nfrom one dominating pattern to another (the low magnitudes\nmean that little noise is sufÔ¨Åcient to shake off these modes\nand activate different modes).\nSuch conclusions should be taken with a grain of salt. We\nshould remember the system also has additive noise. In ad-\ndition, in order to adequately generalize these results, much\nlarger data sets, with many performers, should be used. How-\never, such analyses may help to focus future research on\ncertain aspects of production of music for emotional com-\nmunication.\n751Poster Session 6\nFigure 2 . Eigenvalues for keeping only higher frequency\nband (6 kHz-11 kHz. Ex3.2).\n4. DISCUSSION\nInvestigating the dynamics of generic acoustic features in\nmusical audio can reveal important components of the mu-\nsic, and speciÔ¨Åcally for emotional content. Generic acoustic\nfeatures can be informative for various melodic, harmonic,\nrhythmic and instrumental content of music, and here we\ndemonstrated their successful usage for both monophonic\nand polyphonic music. We have shown that even highly\nreduced audio features, such as the power, can still retain\nmuch of the emotional message, when taking into account\nthe time progression of the property. Interestingly, comple-\nmentary manipulations to reduce the audio features (‚ÄùÔ¨Çat-\ntening the power‚Äù vs. ‚Äùkeeping only the power dynamics‚Äù)\nboth kept a discriminative ability, suggesting that the in-\nformation about the emotional intention carried by separate\ncomponents of the sound is not simply additive, but rather\nhaving redundancy. One should remember, though, that it\nmight require few dimensions of features to discriminate 4\nemotions, but possibly require more detailed features, when\ndiscriminating more emotions and emotional subtleties.\nFuture research using similar methods should be applied\nover more general musical data, with multiple instruments,\nto Ô¨Ånd general dynamic patterns that convey different emo-\ntions. It may be interesting to investigate the critical time\nresolutions that show dynamics that is relevant for emo-\ntional content (perhaps taking sequences of more than 125\ntime frames will reveal slower informative patterns). Exper-\niments with larger data will enable investigating differences\nin strategies, in informative frequency bands, redundancy\npatterns and other aspects, among different emotions. An-\nother interesting direction is to use trained generative mod-\nels to synthesize new audio instances. This is not a simplechallenge, but even if the resulting sounds will not be intel-\nligible or natural sounding, they may still have an effect of\nconveying emotions, and concordance between the emotion\nof the generated audio and that of the generating model will\nbe another convincing argument that the model captures im-\nportant acoustic patterns for emotional communication.\n5.

This phenomenon is most striking in syncopated rhythms, found in many genres of music, including music of non-Western cultures. In general, syncopated rhythms may have energy at frequencies that do not correspond to perceived pulse or meter, and perceived  metrical frequencies that are weak or absent in the objective rhythmic stimulus. In this paper, we consider syncopated rhythms that contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. We used 16 rhythms (3 simple, 13 syncopated) to test a model of pulse/meter perception based on nonlinear resonance, comparing the nonlinear resonance model with a linear analysis. Both models displayed the ability to differentiate between duple and triple meters, however, only the nonlinear model exhibited resonance at the pulse frequency for the most challenging syncopated rhythms. This result suggests that nonlinear resonance may provide a viable approach to pulse detection in syncopated rhythms. 1. INTRODUCTION Pulse is a periodicity perceived in a musical rhythm, operationally defined as the frequency at which one would most likely tap along to a rhythm [11].  People also perceive meter, a structural pattern of accents among beats of the pulse [10]. Pulse and meter can be diagrammed  using the notation of Lerdahl and Jackendoff [10], in which the metrical grid is composed of beats at multiple related frequencies, with strong beats occurring when beats at multiple frequencies overlap in time.  Thus meter organizes beats of the pulse into strong beats and weak beats. In simple rhythms (Figure 1a), note-events occur on strong beats.  Rhythms such as the 3-2 Rumba Clave (Figure 1b), although they share the same nominal metrical structure, are more complex.  In such rhythms, note-events occur on metrically weak beats, and strong metrical beats often correspond to silences. These two attributes define syncopation [3, 12]. Thus, in syncopated rhythms note events are spaced irregularly in time, yet the perceived pulse is regularly timed, and the meter, regularly structured [3, 14]. A goal of theories of pulse perception is to explain how pulse and meter are perceived for musical rhythms in general, and for syncopated rhythms in particular.   \n Figure 1. Example rhythms and metrical grid. Our approach is based on the idea that the pulse percieved in a musical rhythm is a neural resonance that arises in sensory [6, 8, 17] and motor cortices [2, 4]. The experience of meter is posited to arise from interaction of neural resonances at differenct frequencies. In this paper we put forth a neurodynamic model of pulse and meter and ask whether it can explain the perception of pulse and meter in highly syncopated rhythms.  1.1 Neural Oscillation Neural oscillation can arise from the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. The canonical model used here was derived, using normal form theory, from the Wilson-Cowan model of the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations [7, 18]. This model is generic, however, so the responses of the model to musical rhythm are likely to be observed in many other nonlinear oscillator models of rhythm perception. !\"####$\"###$\"#$\"###Simple Rhythma)b)$\"$!!pulse12341234!\"##\"##$\"###$\"#$\"###3-2 Rumba Clave$$!!pulse12341234weakstrongweakstrong\n185Poster Session 2\n   1.2 Model Our conceptual model is a network of neural oscillators, spanning a range of natural frequencies, stimulated with an auditory rhythm. The basic concept is similar to signal processing by a bank of linear filters [15], but with the important difference that the processing units are nonlinear, rather than linear resonators. We can describe the behavior of a linear filter using a differential equation (Eq 1), where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time.  z is a complex-valued state variable; –¢ is radian frequency. –ã < 0 is a linear damping parameter. x(t) denotes linear forcing by a time-varying external signal.   (1) Because z is a complex variable, it has both amplitude and phase.  Resonance in a linear system means that the system oscillates at the frequency of stimulation, with amplitude and phase determined by system parameters. As stimulus frequency, –¢0, approaches the oscillator frequency, –¢, oscillator amplitude, r = |z|, increases, providing band-pass filtering behavior. In the linear case, oscillator amplitude depends linearly on stimulus amplitude. A common model of nonlinear oscillation is based on the normal form for the Hopf bifurcation (Eq 2).     (2) Note the surface similarities between this form and the linear resonator of Equation 1.  Equation 2 can be seen as a generalization of Equation 1, and the two behave the same when –å= 0. Again –¢ is radian frequency, and –ã is still a linear damping parameter.  –å < 0 is a nonlinear damping parameter, which maintains stability when –ã > 0. x(t) denotes linear forcing by an external signal. The term h.o.t. denotes higher-order terms of the nonlinear expansion that are truncated (i.e., ignored) in normal form models. When –ã = 0 and Œ≤ < 0, the system is said to be in the critical parameter regime, poised between damped and spontaneous oscillation. The amplitude of the response depends nonlinearly on the input amplitude. Like linear resonators, nonlinear oscillators have a filtering behavior, responding maximally to stimuli near their own frequency. Differences in behavior include extreme sensitivity to weak signals and high frequency selectivity. Critical oscillators have been used to model critical oscillations of outer hair cells in the cochlea [5]. When –ã > 0 (and Œ≤ < 0), the system exhibits a limit cycle in absence of input; thus, it can oscillate spontaneously.  Our canonical model [7] (Eq 3) is an expansion of the Hopf normal form (Eq 2), which includes higher order terms.   (3) There are again surface similarities with the previous models. The parameters, –¢, –ã and –å1 correspond to the parameters of the truncated model. –å2 is an additional amplitude compression parameter, and c represents strength of coupling to the external stimulus. –é1 and –é2 are frequency detuning parameters. The parameter –è controls the amount of nonlinearity in the system. Most importantly, coupling to a stimulus is nonlinear and has a passive part, P(–è, x(t)) and an active part, A(–è, z), as defined in [7], which produce different higher order resonances, as described in the next section. 1.3 Properties of Nonlinear Resonance Equation 3 displays all the behavioral regimes  described above ‚Äì  linear, critical and limit cycle ‚Äìdepending on the parameter values chosen. Additionally, Equation 3 can also exhibit a double-limit cycle bifurcation, when –ã < 0, Œ≤1> 0, Œ≤2 < 0 (and Œµ > 0). Stable states emerge at rest and at a stable limit cycle; an unstable limit cycle separates the two, functioning as a kind of threshold.  If the stimulus is strong enough, the threshold will be crossed, the system reaches the stable limit cycle, and oscillation can be maintained even after the stimulus has ceased.  Thus an oscillator operating in a double-limit cycle regime can maintain a memory of an oscillating stimulus.  Higher-order resonance means that a nonlinear oscillator with frequency f responds to harmonics (2f, 3f, ...), subharmonics (f/2, f/3, ...) and integer ratios (2f/3, 3f/4, ...) of f. If a stimulus contains multiple frequencies, a nonlinear oscillator will respond at combination frequencies (f2 - f1, 2f1 - f2, ...) as well. Higher order resonances follow orderly relationships and can be predicted given stimulus amplitudes, frequencies and phases. This has important implications for understanding the behavior of such systems. The nonlinear oscillator network does not merely transduce signals; it adds frequency information, which can be used to model pattern recognition and pattern completion, among other things. Neural pattern completion based on nonlinear resonance may explain the perception of pulse and meter in syncopated rhythmic patterns [9, 13].  \nÀôz=z(Œ±+iœâ)+x(t)\nÀôz=z(Œ±+iœâ+Œ≤|z|2)+x(t)+h.o.t.\n Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n18612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   Our hypothesis is that in rhythms with no energy at the pulse frequency, pulse arises due to nonlinear resonance in the brain. Significant contributions may also come from instrinsic dynamics and learned connectivity. As a first test of this hypothesis, we ask whether such resonances arise in a canonical nonlinear model. 2. EXPERIMENT 1 The first experiment compared the objective frequency content of 16 rhythms with the frequency responses of a nonlinear oscillator network. Using Fourier analysis we measured the frequency content of the rhythmic patterns, showing that in syncopated rhythms the pulse frequency is weak or absent. Next, we assessed whether nonlinear resonance could explain the perception of pulse and meter at the frequencies that are predicted by music theoretic analysis of these rhythms.  2.1 Model  Our model consisted of a single network of 289 oscillators described by Equation 3, with natural frequencies logarithmically spaced from 0.25 Hz to 16 Hz.  The model operated in a critical parameter regime (–ã = 0, –å1 = -1,  –å2 = -0.25, and –è = 1), poised between damped and spontaneous oscillation.   2.2 Stimuli We used 16 rhythms: one isochronous pulse train, two canonical metrical rhythms (3/4 and 4/4), three clave rhythms, and ten ‚Äúmissing pulse‚Äù rhythms that were created in our lab in the context of a previous experiment [1]. The clave rhythms were a 3-2 Son Clave, a Rumba Clave, and a clave-like rhythm we dubbed ‚ÄòHard Clave‚Äô. The ten missing pulse rhythms were structured so as to balance strong and weak beats, with four events on strong beats and four events on weak beats. In a previous experiment we observed that most people reliably tap at the nominal pulse frequency for these rhythms. We rendered each rhythmic event as a continuous time onset ‚Äòbump‚Äô with amplitude corresponding to the intensity of the event. All events were of equal intensity, except for the metrical rhythms, where intensity differences marked canonical metrical accents.  All rhythms were rendered at a tempo of 120 bpm, making the pulse frequency 2 Hz. Examples of the rhythmic stimuli are shown in Figure 2.  Figure 2. Examples of stimuli types: Isochronous, Ca-nonical 3/4, a Rumba Clave, and one of the ten missing pulse patterns.   2.3 Method Computations were performed using Matlab 7.4, on a Macintosh Mac Pro, running Mac OS X 10.5.8. In the simulations, the continuous-time pulse trains were used to drive the network model and the resulting oscillatory output behavior was examined. Network behavior was evaluated by assessing steady state amplitude of the resonating oscillators. The natural frequencies of the resonating oscillators indicate which frequencies resonate to the input stimulus. 2.4 Results Figure 3 compares a Fourier analysis (FFT) of four rhythmic input signals with the amplitude profile of the network of nonlinear oscillators. Oscillator natural frequency (Hz) runs along the x-axis, and amplitude is shown on the y-axis.  Musical notation above each panel indicates the pulse and metrical frequencies for each rhythm. For the isochronous rhythm, energy is present at the pulse frequency (2 Hz), and its harmonics. For the canonical rhythms, signal energy was observed at the pulse frequency, while the accents present in the signal contributed frequencies at metrical levels (subharmonics of the pulse). The clave rhythms all had some energy at 2 Hz;  however, this was strongly attenuated compared to the energy at other nearby frequencies. Fourier analysis of the other ten syncopated rhythms revealed no energy at the 2 Hz pulse frequency, while considerable energy was !!\"#$$\"#%%\"#&&\"#''\"###\"#((\"#))\"#*+,-./0-1-2,\n!!\"#$$\"#%%\"#&&\"#''\"###\"#((\"#))\"#*341-15.467&8'\n!!\"#$$\"#%%\"#&&\"#''\"###\"#((\"#))\"#*92:;47364<=\n!!\"#$$\"#%%\"#&&\"#''\"###\"#((\"#))\"#*>5,,51?7@26,=7$7A5:=7B,CD<=1E7F:G65E2H=\n187Poster Session 2\n   observed at non-metrical frequencies. Note that energy was present at the eighth note level of 4 Hz for all rhythms. As illustrated in Figure 3, resonant responses were observed in the oscillator network at frequencies that were not objectively present in the stimulus rhythms. Most importantly, resonances were observed at the pulse frequency for every rhythm. Resonances were also observed at subharmonics of the isochronous rhythm, and for canonical rhythms subharmonic resonances enhanced the response at the metrical frequencies. For the clave rhythms, the response at the pulse frequency (2 Hz) was also enhanced relative to the Fourier amplitude. For the missing pulse rhythms, although there was no energy at the 2 Hz pulse frequency, the nonlinear network responded at the 2 Hz pulse frequency as well as at some additional metrical frequencies.  In summary, both simple and complex rhythms contain multiple frequencies, only some of which appear to be related to the meter. Simple rhythms contain frequencies corresponding to the pulse; however, complex syncopated rhythms contain little or no energy at the pulse frequency. This feature of complex rhythms may be problematic for linear filter based methods of pulse detection.  Nonlinear oscillators can resonate at frequencies corresponding to pulse and meter even when these are not objectively present in the input. However, the simple oscillator array investigated in Experiment 1 is, by itself, likely not sufficient to induce the pulse and meter of complex rhythms. While oscillators resonate at the pulse frequency, a number of stronger resonances are observed at frequencies that do not correspond to pulse or meter. In the next experiment, we ask whether multiple networks together might provide greater frequency selectivity. 3. EXPERIMENT 2 3.1 Stimuli & Method The stimuli methods used in Experiment 2 were the same as in Experiment 1. 3.2 Model The model was based on the same oscillator equations as used in Experiment 1.  The key difference was that in Experiment 2, the model consisted of two networks interacting with each other.  Network 1 had the same parameters as used in Experiment 1. The oscillators in Network 2 were tuned to exhibit double limit cycle bifurcation behavior (–ã = 0.3, –å1 = 1, –å2 = -1, and –è = 1), and thus exhibited both threshold and memory properties.   !!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#'\"#()*+,-.+/+0*\"\"#'\"#(\n!!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#'\"#(12/+/3,24!56'\"\"#'\"#(\n!!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#'\"#(70892!142:;\"\"#'\"#(\n!!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#'\"#(<+/43/;2.!=*,3442>+.!?8@43>0A;B3**3/C!D04*;!%E.;F0;/,G!HIJK\"\"#'\"#(EEL!?8@43>0A;.\n  Figure 3. Experiment 1 results. A subset of the rhythms presented with both an FFT of the stimulus (black) and the  amplitudes of responding nonlinear oscillators (gray). The two networks were connected as shown in Figure 4.  Tonotopic connections between the networks allow Network 1 to drive Network 2. Next, in each network, internal connectivity coupled patches of oscillators to other patches exhibiting small integer ratio frequency relationships, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1.  These connections are assumed to be learned by exposure to Western rhythms, in which duple and triple meters are common. Connectivity from Network 2 to Network 1 was inhibitory. 3.3 Results Across the rhythms presented, Network 1 behaved similarly to the previous experiment, responding to frequencies present in the simulus rhythms, and also adding nonlinear resonances. Example of Network 2 responses are shown in Figure 5. Due to its thresholding properties, Network 2 responded to a subset of frequencies present in the Network 1. Importantly, Network 2 almost always responded at the pulse frequency. Moreover,  the amplitude at 2 Hz was unexpectedly strong given the relatively weak responses observed in Experiment 1.    \n18812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   \n Figure 4. Network architecture for models used in both experiments. \nFigure 5. Results for Experiment 2. Amplitude response profiles for Network 1 (gray) and Network 2 (black). Frequencies were considered ‚Äòactive‚Äô in Network 2 if they exceeded the threshold implicit in the double limit cycle oscillatory dynamics. Active frequencies were compared to metrical frequencies for each rhythm. For syncopated rhythms expected frequencies were the quarter note level (i.e., the pulse, 2 Hz), the eighth note level (4 Hz), as well as the half note (1 Hz) and whole note levels (0.5 Hz) for  Table 1. Summary of results for Experiment 2.  Shaded cells identify frequencies which would be expected to have a resonance for the rhythm based on meter.  Populated cells (x) show which resonant frequencies were active in Net-work 2.  most of the rhythms (the one exception was the canonical 3/4 rhythm, whose slower metrical frequency was 0.67 Hz). The results of the two-network model can be seen in Table 1. Highlighted cells show the frequencies at which response peaks would be expected based on the meter. Populated cells show whether or not response peaks were observed at given frequencies. For all but one rhythm, a response was seen at the pulse frequency of 2 Hz. For the canonical rhythms, response peaks were always found at the expected frequencies and at no others. This set of hierarchically related frequencies may correspond to a perception of meter. For the missing pulse rhythms, response peaks were found most consistently at the pulse frequency and its first harmonic at 4 Hz. At lower frequencies, the results differed from standard metrical predictions. This may explain why people sometimes have difficulty entraining periodic taps with highly syncopated stimuli. In previous experiments, level of syncopation was found to be a good predictor of pulse-finding difficulty; syncopation causes off-beat taps and some switches between on-beat and off-beat tapping [14, 16].  4. DISCUSSION Syncopated rhythms present challenges for pulse detection algorithms. Looked at in the frequency domain, some syncopated rhythms do not contain any energy at the frequency of the pulse. Yet pulse is readily perceived in !!\"!#!\"$!\"$#!\"%&'()*+,-.!!\"!#!\"$!\"$#!\"%&'()*+,-./.+01234$\n5)+.2)'6788.2.)+729:*+.9+,2.\n;1)).9+*<*+=4>'++.2)?\n@2.A,.)9=4!\"%#4!\"#4$\"!4%\"!4B\"!4C\"!$D\"!/.+01234$/.+01234%788.2.)+E88.2.)+5)+.2)'6!\"#$%&'!\"#$%&(F14/.+01234@2.A,.)9*.?\n4\n&'()*+,-.!\"!%!\"!B!\"!D!\"!C!\"$4!\"%#4!\"#4$\"!4%\"!4B\"!4C\"!$D\"!4!\"%#4!\"#4$\"!4%\"!4B\"!4C\"!$D\"!F14/.+01234@2.A,.)9*.?\n44\n!!\"!#!\"$@21G4/.+01234@2.A,.)9*.?\n@2.A,.)9=4!\"%#4!\"#4$\"!4%\"!4B\"!4C\"!$D\"!4!\"%#4!\"#4$\"!4%\"!4B\"!4C\"!$D\"!\n!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#$%)*+,-.+/+0*\n!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#$%12'\n!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#$%30456!7869:\n!\"#$\"!!%#\"\"!!&#\"\"!!'#\"\"!!(#\"\"\"\"#$%;<**</=!>08*:!%?*,<886@+.!A.:B0:/,C3:*D+/*:!E4D8<@0F:\n!!G:@H+.I!%G:@H+.I!&.Stimuli Network 2 Active Frequencies (Hz) Rhythm 1/2 2/3 1 2 4 Other Isochronous x  x x x  4/4 x  x x   3/4  x  x   Son Clave x  x x  0.62 Rumba Clave x  x x  0.62, 0.88 Hard Clave   x x  0.62, 1.24 Missing Pulse 1 x   x x 0.62 Missing Pulse 2    x x 0.63, 0.75 Missing Pulse 3    x x 0.62 Missing Pulse 4    x x 0.62, 0.88, 1.12 Missing Pulse 5 x  x x x 0.62, 0.75, 1.24 Missing Pulse 6    x x 0.62, 0.75 Missing Pulse 7 x   x  0.62, 0.75 Missing Pulse 8 x   x x 0.75 Missing Pulse 9    x x 0.75 Missing Pulse 10   x  x 0.63, 0.75, 1.26 \n189Poster Session 2\n   syncopated rhythms [1, 14]. From the point of view of music perception, this observation implies that the brain adds frequency components that are not objectively present in rhythms themselves. A lack of energy at the pulse frequency may explain why pulse detection methods based on linear resonance experience problems with syncopated rhythms. For syncopated rhythms, our nonlinear model, based on fundamental principles of neurodynamics, resonates at the pulse frequency. This qualitatively matches human performance [1], and the detailed responses of this model provide novel predictions which could be tested in future experiments. Our observations support the hypothesis that pulse corresponds to a neural resonance. In simple networks, nonlinear resonance by itself is capable of restoring a missing pulse frequency. When multiple networks of nonlinear oscillators are coupled together (including internal rhythmic connectivity within networks), they can resonate at a pulse frequency and related metrical frequencies, a form of temporal pattern matching or pattern completion. In future work, we plan to construct and test other models based on nonlinear resonance. For example, the results presented here do not enable us to say whether internal network connectivity or the thresholding properties of Network 2 were primarily responsible for the observed responses. Perhaps both are necessary. Future work in this area will focus on how the connectivity patterns between networks are learned  and address developmental aspects of pulse and meter as well as differences across cultures.  5.

Considerations\nregarding the staff position, staff removal, space- andline-\nzones , as well as how we treat speciÔ¨Åc neume classes and\nmodiÔ¨Åers are covered. This type of notation presents a chal-\nlenge for traditional optical music recognition (OMR) sys-\ntems because individual note pitches are indivisible from the\nlarger ligature group that forms the neume. We have created\na dataset of correctly-notated transcribed chant for compar-\ning the performance of different variants of our pitch-Ô¨Ånding\nsystem.

INTRODUCTION\nOptical music recognition (OMR) is the process of turn-\ning musical notation represented in a digital image into a\ncomputer-manipulable symbolic notation format. Music no-\ntation, however, comes in many different forms, and so there\nis no single OMR system that can recognize all types of mu-\nsic.\nPlainchant is a large collection of monophonic melodies,\nwhich exist as one of the oldest types of notated music in Eu-\nrope. These melodies have been part of (Western) Christian\nliturgy since the Middle Ages and have formed the basis for\nmuch Western music that followed. Its unique system of no-\ntation, constructed on groups of pitches known as neumes ,\nis still in use in liturgical settings and was most famously\nre-popularized in the late 19thCentury by the monks at the\nSolesmes monastery in France.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Perhaps the most used book produced by the Solesmes\ncommunity was the Liber Usualis , a 2000-page service book\nthat contains most of the texts and chants for the ofÔ¨Åces and\nmasses of the church, designed to be a practical reference\nbook by those responsible for performing these services. As\na modern production, many qualities of older manuscript\nsources‚Äînotably the variation in scribes handwriting and\ndegradation due to age‚Äîare not present in the Liber , but\nits sheer size and comprehensiveness provides an excellent\nfoundation for training automatic neume recognizers.\nIn this paper we present our work to date for producing a\nneume recognition system. This work concerns the recogni-\ntion of printed neume pitches, speciÔ¨Åcally in the style used\nthroughout the Liber , known as square-note notation . In\nsquare-note notation, most neumes are ligatures that repre-\nsent multiple pitches, and so accessing the individual notes\nof a neume can be problematic. We have developed a sys-\ntem whereby we recognize the position of the Ô¨Årst pitch of a\nneume group, and then employ a unique approach using au-\ntomatic class labels to recognize the remainder of the pitches\nin that group.\n1.1 Notation: From Neumes to MEI\nWe have chosen the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) for-\nmat1as the basis for capturing the output of our recogni-\ntion system. This format provides an extensible approach to\nencoding different types of music documents [7]. As part\nof this project, we have developed an extension to the MEI\nformat that captures the particular qualities and nuance of\nSolesmes-style square-note notation. We convert the output\nfrom the recognition system into MEI Ô¨Åles through the use\nof the PyMEI library2.\n1.2 Notation Systems\nPlainchant notation is a precursor to modern music notation.\nInitially it was conceived as a means of providing some in-\ndication of melodic contour to a text that was chanted during\n1http://music-encoding.org/\n2https://github.com/ahankinson/pymei\n423Poster Session 3\na liturgical service, and provided no indication of absolute\npitch values. With the invention of the musical staff between\nthe 9thand 10thCenturies, some forms of neumes made the\ntransition to being ‚Äúheightened,‚Äù or given absolute pitches in\nrelation to a staff and clef. Solesmes notation features abso-\nlute pitch, and so its pitch values may be extracted directly.\nDalitz et al. [1] have presented a system for symbol recog-\nnition of Byzantine chant notation using neume forms unique\nto this repertoire. This system of notation, however, does\nnot use a staff to specify absolute pitch. The neume shapes\nfor this type of notation speciÔ¨Åed melodic contour and rel-\native pitch direction, and the authors do not report any at-\ntempt at supplying absolute pitch information. Gezerlis and\nTheodoridis [2] have also presented a system for recogniz-\ning Byzantine chant notation, however, like Dalitz et al.,\ntheir system does not perform any pitch transcription.\nLaskov and Dimitrov [3] have presented a system for per-\nforming image segmentation for neume notation, separat-\ning the neumes as objects of interest from the background.\nAgain, however, this system is for unpitched neumes and\nthus the authors made no attempt at extracting pitches.\nFinally, Ramirez and Ohya [4] have presented a classiÔ¨Å-\ncation system used to classify eight basic types of neumes\nin pitched manuscript sources from the 14thCentury. This\nsystem classiÔ¨Åes these symbols accurately, but the authors\ndid not report any attempt at performing pitch recognition\nfrom the recognized classes. The authors also made no in-\ndication of how their system would perform outside of the\neight standard neume forms they used.\nIn our paper, we address a method of performing neume\nclassiÔ¨Åcation and pitch transcription from 11 basic types of\nneumes and its multiple variants presented on a staff.\n2. WORKFLOW\nWe are creating a fully searchable, web-based version of the\nLiber . This project will allow users to search for speciÔ¨Åc\nmelodic sequences or patterns in the book; our system will\nreturn all matching patterns, highlighting them in the origi-\nnal image. To accomplish this goal, we needed to extract all\nmusical and textual information from the Liber . Although\nit contains text and music, this paper will focus only on the\nmusic. We are using the digitized, downloadable version\nof the Liber published by Descl ¬¥ee & Co in 19613, which\ncomes as a PDF Ô¨Åle with 2340 pages. Different categories\nof information and content can be found on the pages: title,\ntext, staves, lettrines , and lyrics. These were separated into\ndifferent layers during an automated preprocessing step to\nallow for easier content analysis.\n3http://musicasacra.com/2007/07/17/\nliber-usualis-online/2.1 Page Preprocessing\nWe converted the PDF Ô¨Åle into Tagged Image File Format\n(TIFF) image Ô¨Åles so that they could be read by Aruspix [5],\na cross-platform application devoted to optical music recog-\nnition on music printed during the European Renaissance.\nThe preprocessing capabilities of Aruspix include skew\ncorrection, resizing, cleaning, staff-position retrieval, and\nclassiÔ¨Åcation of the elements in a page in the following cat-\negories: frames and borders, lettrines , lyrics, inter-staff ele-\nments, and titles. These page elements are uniquely coloured\nto allow the separation of the page elements into discrete\nlayers for extraction. The colouring feature is also use-\nful for manual correction. Aruspix returns a container Ô¨Åle,\nwhich includes the original binarised TIFF image, a sec-\nond coloured TIFF image with each one of the page ele-\nments in a different colour, and an XML Ô¨Åle with infor-\nmation about the processes performed on the page. After\nautomatically preprocessing the entire TIFF images using\nAruspix, we manually corrected any misclassiÔ¨Åed page ele-\nments. We then modiÔ¨Åed the Gamera4Aruspix (G4A) Gam-\nera Toolkit4to extract the preprocessed layers into sepa-\nrate images, providing us with images containing only mu-\nsic staves.\n2.2 Retrieving Staff Position and Removing Staff-Lines\nWe processed the images containing only music notation\nwith the MusicStaves Gamera Toolkit5. This toolkit al-\nlowed us to extract each staff line position in the staff, store\nits location for later determination of pitches and remove all\nlines for later glyph classiÔ¨Åcation. MusicStaves is designed\nto work with an arbitrary number of lines, which was re-\nquired because the Liber features 4-line staves.\n2.2.1 Staff Detection\nThe MusicStaves toolkit has a number of different algo-\nrithms for detecting the position of staff lines in the image\nand removing them, leaving only the remaining elements\nin the resulting image. These algorithms provide different\nresults depending on the notation style and image deforma-\ntions. We tested two different staff-Ô¨Ånding algorithms. For\nthe Ô¨Årst approach, we retrieved the average vertical position\nof each one of the lines horizontally across the whole page,\nand named this approach AvgLines . This approach allowed\nus to determine the gross slope of a staff line across the page\nand thus to correct for staff lines that are not straight. In the\nsecond approach, we used the Miyao algorithm, capable of\nbreaking a staff line into equidistant segments to provided\na more precise means of determining horizontal staff slope\n4https://github.com/vigliensoni/G4A\n5http://lionel.kr.hs-niederrhein.de/ ‚àºdalitz/data/\nprojekte/stafflines/\n42412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 1 . Extract of neumes in page 1045, stave 2 of\ntheLiber with the notation we developed for encoding the\nglyphs and intervals for each one of the neume variations.\nchanges in inclined, braked, or Ô¨Çexed staves [8]. We pre-\nserved the position of all staff segments and named this ap-\nproach Miyao .\n2.2.2 Staff Removal\nA previous study by Dalitz et al. [6] shows that there is no\nsingle superior algorithm for performing staff removal. On\na number of different metrics, they observe that for images\nwith deformations, the performance of many algorithms for\nstaff removal is very similar, and so there is no clear best\ntechnique. We informally tested the Ô¨Åve algorithms pro-\nvided by MusicStaves and determined that for our reper-\ntoire, the Roach & Tatem algorithm performed the best.\n2.3 Neume ClassiÔ¨Åcation and Labeling\nAfter the detection and removal of the staves, the images\nwere loaded into the Gamera interactive classiÔ¨Åer. The glyphs\nfrom 40 pages of the Liber were manually classiÔ¨Åed to cre-\nate a training dataset for later automatic classiÔ¨Åcation. Our\npitch-Ô¨Ånding approach would only retrieve the position of\nthe Ô¨Årst part of a glyph, so for different variations of neumes,\nan encoding scheme was developed that uniquely captured\nthe shape of the entire neume, grouping like neumes into the\nsame class. This encoding scheme identiÔ¨Åed the intervals as\nwell as other auxiliary shapes in the neume and served as a\nclass identiÔ¨Åer. Those other elements that have an effect on\nthe shape of a neume, such as dots, horizontal and vertical\nepisemas , the quilismas , which are alterations of the note\nshapes, or the combination of some of those elements, are\nexplicitly declared and encoded. Figure 1 shows an excerpt\nof the Liber with the notation we developed for encoding\nthe neumes and other notational elements. It can be seen\nthat the interval between two consecutive points in a neume\nis encapsulated into the glyph class name in the Gamera in-\nteractive classiÔ¨Åer. Consequently, Ô¨Ånding the pitch of the\nstarting note allows us to derive pitches for all notes in a\ngiven neume.2.3.1 Automated Neume Pre-classiÔ¨Åcation\nAfter manually training the classiÔ¨Åer with 40 pages of neumes,\nwe had a dataset large enough to be used as a model for au-\ntomatic classiÔ¨Åcation of elements for the remaining pages.\nA classiÔ¨Åcation and optimization script was developed to\nautomatize the process of classifying elements in the new\npages and optimize the classiÔ¨Åer. By this means, the classi-\nÔ¨Åer increased in size with new neumes or new neume varia-\ntions only.\n2.3.2 Human-supervised Neume ClassiÔ¨Åcation\nThere were inevitable errors in the automatic classiÔ¨Åcation,\nand so we performed a manual correction of each page by\nmusicologists trained in the Solesmes notation system. This\nensured that all glyphs for every single page were correct.\n3. PITCH-FINDING APPROACHES\nTo calculate the pitch of the starting point for each neume,\nwe needed to know its location on the staff as well as the\nclef type and its position. To accomplish this, we created\nimaginary lines, ledger lines , and zones, line- andspace-\nzones , in the staff and calculated the placement of neumes\nin these zones.\n3.1 Ledger Lines\nWe detected the staff-line positions using the Miyao and\nAvgLines approaches described previously. However, some\nneumes, or notes inside a neume, were located on ledger\nlines above the Ô¨Årst (upper) or below the fourth (lower) line.\nTherefore, we virtually extend the number of staff lines by\ncreating four imaginary ledger lines, two above the stave\nand two below. The distance between two staff lines for the\nledger lines was determined by projecting the distance of the\nclosest actual staff lines as the ledger lines.\n3.2 Space- and Line-Zones\nNotes of a given neume can be located either on the staff\nlines or in the spaces between lines. We deÔ¨Åned imaginary\nzones between the staff lines where the neumes could be lo-\ncated. We calculated these imaginary zones by segmenting\nthe space between two lines into four segments. The sec-\nond and third segments correspond to a space-zone , and the\nÔ¨Årst and fourth were grouped with the previous fourth and\nÔ¨Årst, respectively, to designate a line-zone . We assigned to\neach zone an unique number which corresponds to what we\nnamed the note-position of each neume on the staff. Figure\n2 shows the imaginary ledger lines and zones in a stave.\n3.3 Bounding Box\nTo determine the pitches of the neumes, we Ô¨Årst tested an\napproach based on the bounding boxes of each one of the\n425Poster Session 3\nFigure 2 . Stave showing imaginary upper and lower ledger\nlines as well as line- andspace-zones .\nglyphs‚Äîthat is, the rectangular area that deÔ¨Ånes the bounds\nof a particular glyph. These bounding boxes are generated\nby Gamera and can be easily accessed. We determined that\nmany neumes began in either the top left of the bounding\nbox (the upposition) or the bottom left of the bounding box\n(thedown position). A neume position was pre-determined\nfor its speciÔ¨Åc neume class, and the up or down position of\nthe Ô¨Årst note was correlated with all possible line or space\nzones in a staff. From there the pitch of the Ô¨Årst note of the\nneume was determined. Although this approach worked for\nmost of the neumes, some of them, especially torculus and\ncompound neumes (see Figure 1, glyph 8), do not neces-\nsarily start with a note in the upper or lower position. The\nstarting note of those neumes can be located between their\nbounding box‚Äôs left vertices, making the bounding box ap-\nproach impractical for use across the entire Liber . Because\nof this limitation we abandoned this approach.\n3.4 Horizontal Projection and Center of Mass\nA more robust approach is based on the horizontal projec-\ntion of the neumes. To Ô¨Ånd the starting note for each one of\nthe neumes we created a sub-image‚Äîa vertically split ver-\nsion of the original neume with a width of the size of a single\npunctum . This unit was chosen because we considered the\npunctum (see Figure 1, glyph 3) as the nominal neume unit.\nBefore creating the sub-images, we calculated the average\npunctum size among all punctums on a page and used that\nsize for any sub-image creation. We then retrieved the hor-\nizontal projection of each one of the neumes and calculated\nits centre-of-mass, that is, the point around which the black\npixels of the sub-image were equally distributed. By using\nthis method, we found the mean location of the starting po-\nsition of a neume, and we determined the staff zone for this\nstarting point, allowing us to automatically derive its start-\ning pitch.3.5 Clef Type and Position for Shifting Pitch Notes\nThe pitches of the neumes in a staff depend on the clef type,\nCorF, and its line position on the staff. The Gamera clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation process does not treat the clef in a special way,\nand so a method must be devised to allow any pitch-Ô¨Ånding\nsystem to automatically detect the closest clef on a given\nstaff so that all notes on that staff may be correctly identi-\nÔ¨Åed. The coordinates (relative to the staff boundaries) where\neach neume was located was stored temporarily. After all\nelements in the staff were classiÔ¨Åed, they were then sorted\naccording to their vertical position, rounded to the nearest\nstaff boundary, and then by their position on the x-axis, left\nto right. This produced a sequence of neumes, ordered by\nstaff and then occurrence on the staff, and their pitch was\nassigned according to the clef, which is always the Ô¨Årst ele-\nment for each stave.\n3.6 Special Neumes and Neume ModiÔ¨Åers\nAlthough the centre-of-mass approach provided a more ro-\nbust method of initial pitch detection, there were still some\nneume shapes that required further processing, in particu-\nlar the podatus ,epiphonus ,cephalicus ,scandicus , and their\nvariations (see Figure 1, glyphs 4, 5, 6, and 7). These shapes\nhave sub-images with two notes or elements that are verti-\ncally stacked, shifting the centre-of-mass and making our\nprojection system an inaccurate method of Ô¨Ånding the ini-\ntial pitch position of the neume on the staff. To Ô¨Åx this\nissue and improve accuracy, we made a number of excep-\ntions where the sub-image was determined by Ô¨Årst split-\nting these neumes horizontally. The centre-of-mass of the\nsub-image‚Äôs largest connected component was then consid-\nered the centre-of-mass of the neume. Similar processing\nwas needed for neumes that had horizontal episemas, ver-\ntical episemas, or dots. Their centre-of-mass was shifted\ndue to the presence of these modiÔ¨Åers, and so we removed\nthese elements before calculating their vertical position on\nthe staff. We left this feature of treating some neumes and\nneume modiÔ¨Åers in the described way as an option for test-\ning its performance in comparison to the standard approach.\nWe named the former Exceptions and the latter No Excep-\ntions .\n3.7 Moving the Space- and Line-Zones\nThe position of the space- and line-zones in relation to the\nstaff lines has an impact in the performance of the pitch-\nÔ¨Ånding system, and we informally tested several values for\nthis relation in order to see how its performance could be\nimproved. For the Ô¨Ånal comparison of settings, we tried two\napproaches for the spacing: a regular spacing of the zones,\nalready described, and a shifted spacing, with the upper line\nof the space-zone shifted down by 2/16 and the lower one\nby 1/16 of the staff-space in that staff segment.\n42612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 3 . Visualization of pitch Ô¨Ånd algorithm performance in page 1242 stave 5 of the Liber Usualis using the Python Imaging\nLibrary and the original image.\n4. TESTING AND RESULTS\nTo evaluate the performance of our six pitch-Ô¨Ånding sys-\ntems and their variants (Miyao, AvgLines, Exceptions, No\nExceptions, Regular Spacing, Shifted Spacing), we created\na ground truth dataset consisting of 20 random pages with\na total of 2219 neumes and 3114 pitches correctly labeled.\nWe used the MEI format for storing the music notation. This\nformat has the ability to correlate zones on an image with\nmusical structures encoded in XML [7]. We developed a\nscript for highlighting neumes on the page image and iden-\ntifying its pitch in text next to the note on the screen (Figure\n3). This visualization tool allowed us to quickly identify and\ncorrect the miscalculated pitches in the MEI Ô¨Åle in order to\ncreate a ground truth dataset.\nWe tested our system using six different variants based on\nthe staff-line detection approaches we developed, the treat-\nment of glyphs with special conditions, and a shift in the\nspacing of the line- and space-zones. The nomenclature we\nused for these variants can be seen in Table 1.\nTable 1 . Nomenclature used for the different variants of\nthe experimental testing for the performance of our pitch-\nÔ¨Ånding system.\nFigure 4 shows the recognition rates achieved by the six\nmethods for the different neume classes (the compound and\nscandicus neumes are not included in the graph because they\nare relatively rare in our dataset.)\nOverall, the best variant performance was MES, i.e., the\nvariant that included the Miyao algorithm, the handling of\nspecial exceptions, and correction for vertical spacing, with\na 97% recognition rate in Ô¨Ånding the pitch of the Ô¨Årst note\nof a neume only. This value was reduced to 95% when we\nretrieved and compared all notes from all neumes with the\nground-truth dataset. ANR performance was the worst at\n85% for the Ô¨Årst note pitch and 81% for all pitches.From the graph we can see that the cephalicus andpo-\ndatus , and to a lesser degree the epiphonus ,scandicus , and\ntorculus , share a common pattern: their best results were\nachieved with the MES, AES, and MER variants, i.e., the\nvariants that include handling of the special exceptions. These\nare the neume shapes for which the special exceptions to\nthe centre-of-mass approach were designed, and so, it is\nclear that these special exceptions were necessary. On the\nother hand, clivis ,porrectus , and punctums , and to a lesser\ndegree, the virgas , have in common that their high perfor-\nmance was accomplished using MES and MNS, i.e., the\nvariants that include both the Miyao algorithm and correc-\ntion for vertical spacing. Collectively, these neumes rep-\nresent more than 80% of all neumes in the dataset, and so\nit is clear that the use of the Miyao approach with shifted\nspacing is important for achieving the most accurate recog-\nnition possible. ConÔ¨Årmatory testing with logistic regres-\nsion showed that overall, all three of our innovations‚Äîuse\nof the Miyao algorithm, special treatment of exceptions, and\nspacing correction‚Äîproduced statistically signiÔ¨Åcant ( Œ±=\n0.05) improvements to the recognition rate. Furthermore, as\nFigure 4 illustrates, these improvements are large enough to\nmake an important difference in the quality of our output,\nbringing the overall recognition rate from 85% to 97%.\n5. FUTURE WORK\nFormal research should be done to determine the best po-\nsition and spacing of the line- and space-zones. We discov-\nered that this feature is an important factor to Ô¨Ånd the correct\npitches for some neumes. Secondly, we want to calculate the\nperformance of all the automated workÔ¨Çow, including the\nneume classiÔ¨Åcation and pitch recognition, to see how our\nsystem performs automatically, without human supervision.\nAs was stated, at the end of our project we will have the\nentire Liber Usualis fully transcribed and searchable. We\nhope that it will be a great source of information for mu-\nsicologists as well as church goers and musicians. At the\nsame time, however, we will have a massive ground truth\nof correctly transcribed melodies and neumes, and it could\nbe used as the starting point for digitizing and research us-\ning other books and manuscripts with Solesmes and similar\nnotation.\n427Poster Session 3\nFigure 4 .

In contrast to books, they\ngenerally remain inaccessible for content-based retrieval and\nalgorithmic analysis. There is no analogue to Google Books\nfor music scores, and there exist no large corpora of sym-\nbolic music data that would empower musicology in the\nway large text corpora are empowering computational lin-\nguistics, sociology, history, and other humanities that have\nprinted word as their major source of evidence about their\nresearch subjects. We want to help change that. In this pa-\nper we present the Ô¨Årst result of our work in this direction\n- the Music Ngram Viewer and search engine, an analog of\nGoogle Books Ngram Viewer and Google Books search for\nmusic scores.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis project seeks to do for music scores what Google Books\nSearch does for books. We are aiming at indexing all scanned\nmusic scores and making their content available for query-\ning and algorithmic analysis. We would like to help build\nup the foundation needed for computational musicology re-\nsearch by assembling a large corpus of symbolic music data.\nWe have developed a search engine and processing pipeline\nfor scores from the Petrucci Music Library (IMSLP,\nhttp://imslp.org), the largest music score library on the Inter-\nnet. Our system takes the scores in PDF format, runs optical\nmusic recognition (OMR) software over them, indexes the\ndata and makes them accessible for querying and data min-\ning. The search engine is built upon Hadoop and HBase and\nruns on a cluster. Our system has already recognized more\nthan 250 million notes from about 650 thousand sheets, or\n45 thousand scores.\nWe chose the Petrucci library as our Ô¨Årst data source be-\ncause of the low entry barrier: both the scores and their\nscans at the IMSLP are free from copyright, and so we were\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.free to use them without asking for permission. Therefore at\nthe beginning of the development it was the easiest collec-\ntion to work with. But the Petrucci Library contains only a\nsmall part of all scores digitized by the libraries worldwide.\nWe would like to help libraries not only make their score\ncollections searchable, but also to present them in novel\nways. In this paper we present one such interface - the Mu-\nsic Ngram Viewer and search engine.\nThe paper is structured as follows. First, we provide a\nshort review the related work in the areas of symbolic mu-\nsic corpora and music search engines. Then we introduce\nour search engine and analysis platform, describe its archi-\ntecture and talk about the data collected so far. The next\nsection presents the application built on top of the platform,\nthe Music Ngram Viewer and search engine. We provide\nsome statistics collected during the Ô¨Årst three months after\nthe public launch of the Ngram Viewer. This section is fol-\nlowed by a short conclusion.\n2. RELATED WORK\n2.1 Music data collections\nExisting corpora of symbolic music data vary in size and\nquality. Probably the largest collection is the Kunst der\nFuge collection with about 18,000 MIDI Ô¨Åles (mostly piano\nworks or reductions) contributed by the Internet users. A\ncomparably large collection can be accessed via the search\nengine at Musipedia.com, although the data set is not avail-\nable for download or purchase. A collection from the Cen-\nter for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities at\nStanford University is of excellent quality, containing com-\nplete orchestral scores in MusicXML format, but is com-\nparably small with 880 manually encoded compositions in\n4116 movements. It also provides a search interface for the\ncollected data, the ThemeÔ¨Ånder. The online version of Bar-\nlow and Morgenstern‚Äôs Dictionary of Musical Themes con-\ntains 9,825 monophonic melodies of a few measures length.\n2.2 Search engines and interfaces\nTwo existing systems are most relevant for our work: the\nMusipedia search engine and the Probado project.\nMusipedia offers multiple querying interfaces: query by\nhumming, virtual keyboard, search by rhythm and by typed\n359Poster Session 3\nin melody. The database behind Musipedia is assembled\nfrom different MIDI and MusicXML collections. Most mu-\nsic is either composed or transcribed for piano, and there are\nfew orchestral scores in the system.\nThe Probado project offers a very advanced interface for\nsimultaneously browsing the scores and the audio record-\nings aligned to them (cf. [2], [3]). The scores have been\nrecognized using the SharpEye OMR software.\n3. SEARCH ENGINE AND ANALYSIS PLATFORM\n3.1 System architecture\nOur system consists of two major components: the frontend\nand the backend.\nThe backend is responsible for importing, processing and\nindexing the scores and the metadata. For importing and\npreprocessing the scores we use a cluster of Linux machines.\nThe workÔ¨Çow relies on Amazon‚Äôs Simple Queue Service for\npassing tasks between different processing steps.\nWe have implemented wrappers for various optical music\nrecognition systems: an open source Java-based Audiveris,\nand the proprietary Windows-based and GUI-only Sharp-\nEye, CapellaScan and Smartscore. For the GUI-only OMR\nsystems we implemented wrapper scripts that allow us to\nintegrate these systems into the recognition workÔ¨Çow while\nrunning inside the VMWare virtual machines. After evaluat-\ning these OMR systems in our environment we came to the\nconclusion that Smartscore currently offers the best recog-\nnition rates among the four systems we tested, and so the\nmajority of the scores in our database are recognized using\nSmartscore 10.3.2.\nThe workÔ¨Çow components responsible for indexing and\nmetadata processing are running in the Hadoop and HBase\nenvironments [8]. The frontend presenting the processed\ndata is hosted on Google‚Äôs App Engine.\nUsing HBase for data storage offers the advantage of\nbuilt-in redundancy and compression. Currently, the inverse\nindex of the ngram viewer and the search engine, which\nare described in the next section, uses 50 Gigabytes. With-\nout compression, this number would be an order of mag-\nnitude higher. Another advantage of using Hadoop in the\nprocessing backend is the ability to scale it easily with vari-\nous providers, like Amazon EC2 or supercomputing centers,\nwhich is beneÔ¨Åcial for a research project.\nUsing Google App Engine for the frontend has the ben-\neÔ¨Åt of reliability, security and ease of development and de-\nployment. In our setup we use the App Engine also as a\ncaching layer for the Hadoop backend, where the bulk of\nthe data is stored.3.2 Data\nCurrently the search engine contains the data from the Petrucci\nMusic Library. The system has already recognized more\nthan 1,000,000 sheets from more than 65,000 scores. Here\nare some occurrence counts of musical symbols recognized\nby the system. The database contains 264M notes, 45M\nmeasures, 3.7M keys, 2.8M parts, 630K staves, 52K trill\nmarks and 23 fffff signs. The following Ô¨Ågure contains the\noccurrence counts of piano signs:\np 1808243\npp 403366\nppp 20945\npppp 1024\nppppp 10\npppppp 2\nFigure 1 . Counts of piano signs in the IMSLP scores recog-\nnized so far.\n4. MUSIC NGRAM VIEWER AND SEARCH\nENGINE\nInspired by the Google Books Ngram Viewer [1], we imple-\nmented a similar application for music scores on top of our\nplatform. We extracted the score metadata provided by the\nusers of Petrucci Music Library from the web site. For all\nscores with available date of composition or at least of Ô¨Årst\npublication (about two thirds of all scores), for all voices we\nextracted all melodies of up to Ô¨Åfteen notes length. Chords\nwere represented as rising note sequences. Then, for each\nyear we stored the occurrence counts of melodies that oc-\ncurred three or more times in scores published or composed\nduring that year. We published our system at\nwww.peachnote.com. We also provided the dataset behind\nthe Ngram Viewer under the Creative Commons Attribution\nlicense. As far as we know, these are the Ô¨Årst publicly avail-\nable system and dataset of the kind.\n4.1 User Input\nUsers can use virtual piano keyboard implemented in Flash\nto enter their queries. In the current version query are se-\nquences of pitches. The note duration is not considered.\n4.2 Ngram Viewer\nCurrently the database contains ngrams up to the length 15,\nor melodies of up to sixteen notes. If a melody occurs in\nsome year more than two times, it is stored in the database.\nThis results in approximately 200 million ngram-year records\nin the database.\n36012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nFigure 2 . Occurrences of the Ode to Joy motif\nThe above chart shows the occurrences of the Ode to Joy\nmotif from Beethoven‚Äôs Ninth Symphony, encoded differ-\nentially (the numbers represent differences between conse-\nquent notes) - a 7-gram, ‚Äù0 1 2 0 -2 -1 -2‚Äù. What the y-axis\nshows is this: of all the 7-grams contained in the OMR‚Äôed\nscores from IMSLP, the Petrucci Music Library, how many\nare identical with the Ô¨Årst 8 notes of Ode to Joy up to a patch\nshift? Here, you can observe a peak around 1822 - the year\nof the Ninth‚Äôs composition. Apparently, the score of the\nNinth symphony contains most occurrences of this pattern.\nIt is interesting to learn what the other peaks are. Our search\nengine described in the next section provides an answer to\nthis question.\nThe next graph shows the frequency of occurrence of ma-\njor and minor chords:\nThe following graph shows the emergence of the whole-\ntone scale at the turn of the 20th century.\nThe graph below depicts the number of occurrences of\ntwelve intervals from the minor second to the octave in our\ndatabase, by year:\nThe gap between 1925 and 2000 is due to scores still\nbeing under copyright protection and hence unavailable on\nIMSLP. Modern composers, however, are free to upload\ntheir own compositions, and indeed they do so, as the bump\non the right tells.\nThe next Ô¨Ågure shows the data for the same time frame\nand same intervals, but this time it is normalized by the total\nnumber of notes published in a given year and stored in our\ndatabase.\nThe more scores we have for any given year, the more\nreliable are the statistics.\n4.3 Search Engine\nFor each ngram which is stored in the Ngram Viewer dataset,\nwe also provide the information about the scores containing\nthe given sequence. Using the dynamic ngram chart users\ncan select the time range and get the list of scores composed\nduring this time which contain the given note sequence. The\nlist of compositions is paginated and sorted by the number\nof occurrences of the query in the scores. For each score\nwe provide a list of pages containing the query. In future\nreleases we will display the score sheets and highlight the\nlocations of the queried note sequences. Also, for queries\nreturning less than 10,000 scores we provide users the abil-\nity to Ô¨Ålter the search results by text, using corresponding\n361Poster Session 3\ntags provided by users of the IMSLP website. This way\nusers can select pieces of particular genre (for example sym-\nphonies or quartets), participating instrument or instrument\ngroup (harp, winds), or composer.\n4.4 Usage data\nThe system has been launched on May 5-th of this year,\nwhen the Petrucci library added the ‚ÄùSearch by Melody‚Äù\nlink on its home page. There has been a short announce-\nment on the IMSLP Journal, but apart from that we have not\npromoted the search engine in any way, since we wanted\nto test it and improve its quality Ô¨Årst. We installed Google\nAnalytics to gain insights into our users‚Äô behavior. In the\nfollowing we present a few data points we collected using\nGoogle Analytics.\nIn the Ô¨Årst three months the system has been used by\nmore than 50,000 people from over 160 countries. On av-\nerage the search engine processed a search query every 5\nseconds.\nTo see how the system has been used by people who are\nreally interested in the insights it provides and to separate\nthem from casual users, we looked at the statistics for visits\nwith duration longer than 20 minutes. There have been 1385\nsuch visits, and the average time on site was 60 minutes,\nwhich gives a total of 1385 hours of intensive research using\nthe database. We also looked at the number of users who\nvisited the website often. More than 1500 people used the\nsystem more than 10 times, 426 users visited the site more\nthan 50 times, and 177 of them visited more than 100 times.\nThe Ô¨Åles from the Ngram dataset have been downloaded\nmore than 800 times.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have presented a new music score search\nengine and analysis platform. The system opens new ways\nto explore notated music. The users can easily obtain in-\nsights that were hard to come by in the past. We also pro-\nvide a large data set that can be used in computational mu-\nsicology research. We continue digitizing score collections\nand will build additional search indexes that will allow more\nprecise and musically meaningful queries.\n6.

INTRODUCTION\nMusic itself is an expression of emotion. Music emotion\nplays an important role in music information retrieval and\nrecommendation system. Because of the explosive growth\nof music libraries, traditional emotion annotation carried out\nonly by experts can no longer satisÔ¨Åes the needs. Thus, auto-\nmatic recognition of emotions becomes the key to the prob-\nlem. Though having received increasing attention, it is still\nat the early stage. [5]\nMany methods have been applied to automatic classiÔ¨Å-\ncation of songs‚Äô emotions. Traditionally, features such as\nMFCC and chord are extracted from audio content to build\nemotion classiÔ¨Åers. Natural language texts are the abstrac-\ntion of the human cognition, emotion included. Endowed\nwith emotion, lyrics are quite effective in predicting music\nemotion [2]. As the Internet booms, music related web doc-\numents and social tags [13] also provide valuable resources.\nWith the complementarities of features extracted from dif-\nferent modalities,more and more work [6] focus on multi-\nmodal classiÔ¨Åcation.\nHere we focus on the emotion classiÔ¨Åcation of music\nbased on lyrics only. As it is pointed out in [5], lyrics based\napproaches are particularly difÔ¨Åcult because feature extrac-\ntion and schemes for emotional labeling of lyrics are non-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.trivial, especially when considering the complexities involved\nwith disambiguating affect from text. In spite of those dif-\nÔ¨Åculties, the linguistic aspects of songs contains lots of e-\nmotion information. Firstly, some lexical items in lyrics are\nhighly relevant to certain emotion. Secondly, the pronun-\nciation of words must conform with the emotion, just as in\nspoken language, loudness and pitch play an important role\nin identifying the speakers‚Äô emotion [4].\nIn this work, we propose two sets of low dimensional fea-\ntures based on lyrics. We extend the work of Zaanen [11] to\nget the Ô¨Årst set of features based on tf*idf while the other is\nproposed based on rhymes [1]. Then classiÔ¨Åer combination\napproach is adopted to fuse these two sets of features.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We Ô¨Årst\npresent related work(Section 2). Then we will describe the\ntaxonomy of emotion(Section 3), features devised for emo-\ntion classiÔ¨Åcation(Section 4) and classiÔ¨Åer combination ap-\nproach(Section 5). Experimental results and analyses are\npresented in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.\n2. RELATED WORK\nRelatively few research focuses on the use of lyrics as the\nsole feature for emotion classiÔ¨Åcation. Traditional methods\nsuch as the Vector Space Model(VSM) [3] are commonly\nused in text categorization,but shortcomings exist. Vector\nspace often has very high dimensionality and is noisy, re-\nsulting in huge computational cost and low accuracy. We\nhave to turn to features selection techniques.\nRecently, more information is integrated into the features,\nas in Semantic Vector Space Model(SVSM) [14] and Fuzzy\nClustering Method(FCM) [15]. In SVSM, all kinds of emo-\ntion units are extracted from Lyrics. Emotion unit is com-\nposed of an emotional word and the qualiÔ¨Åer and negative\nrelated to it. The count of emotion unit of each type is used\nas the feature. FCM analyses the emotion of each sentence\nbased on emotion dictionary ANCW. Then a fuzzy cluster-\ning method is implemented to choose the main emotion of a\nsong. Both of them use additional dictionaries and depend\ntoo much on the syntactic analysis.However these resources\nare not mature.\nWithout the use of additional resources, Zaanen proposes\n765Poster Session 6\na new approach to tf*idf feature [11]. He uses tf*idf to mea-\nsure the correlation between a term and an emotion. Lyrics\nare transformed to a feature vector, and each dimension of\nthe vector represents the correlation between the lyrics and\nan emotion. Beside, as far as we know, there‚Äôs no work fo-\ncusing on the rhyme of lyrics for classiÔ¨Åcation of emotion.\nIn this study, we focus on simple and low dimensional\nfeatures. The simple means that syntactic analysis and addi-\ntional dictionary which are not mature are not needed; low\ndimensionality means the features can be processed fast e-\nnough in practice. Two sets of features are proposed, one\nbased on the work of Zaanen‚Äôs and the other based on the\nrhyme of lyrics. Then we go on to Ô¨Ånd a way to combine\nthose features.\nThe methods to fuse these two sets of features can be\ndivided into two categories:features level fusion and clas-\nsiÔ¨Åers level fusion. In the features level fusion, a new set\nof feature is generated by operations such as concatenating\nand features selection. A machine learning algorithm is then\nused to construct a classiÔ¨Åer. In the classiÔ¨Åers level fusion,\none classiÔ¨Åer is built on each set of features. The Ô¨Ånal result\nis obtained by fusing the output of each classiÔ¨Åer.\nClassiÔ¨Åer combination is an effective way to improve the\nperformance [10]. The methods to fuse classiÔ¨Åers generated\nfrom different sets of features can be categorized into either\nbase-learning or meta-learning. Meta-learning studies how\nto choose the right bias dynamically, as opposed to base-\nlearning where the bias is Ô¨Åxed priori, or user parameterized\n[12].\nCombinations with Ô¨Åxed structures are base-learning meth-\nods. For example, sum of scores holds the assumption that\nthe label with the biggest sum of score is true label. On\nthe other hand, Combinations which are trained using avail-\nable training samples are meta-learning methods. Boosting\nand stacked generalization are examples of meta-learning\nmethods. Boosting algorithm is originally designed for im-\nproving the accuracy of classiÔ¨Åers based on one set of fea-\ntures, which does not Ô¨Åt our needs. Stack generalization\nuses the outputs of basic classiÔ¨Åers as the inputs of the meta-\nclassiÔ¨Åer to predict the Ô¨Ånal result.\n3. TAXONOMY\nWe adopt Thayer‚Äôs arousal-valence emotion plane [9] as our\nemotion taxonomy. In this taxonomy, emotion is described\nby two dimensions:arousal(from calm to excited) and va-\nlence(from angry to happy). These two dimensions are most\nimportant and universal in expressing emotion [8]. As shown\nin Ô¨Ågure 1, four emotion classes happy, angry, sad, and re-\nlaxing are deÔ¨Åned according to the four quadrants of the e-\nmotion plane.\nFigure 1 . Thayer‚Äôs A V model\n4. FEATURES\nZaanen proposed a new feature space based on tf*idf [11].The\nfeature vector is short and the method is robust. By tak-\ning the part of speech(POS) into consideration, we improve\nthe emotion expressive ability of Zaanen‚Äôs model. Further\nmore, we make use of rhyme related cues of lyrics which\nare highly related to expression of emotion.\n4.1 pos tf*idf\nSome abbreviations are clariÔ¨Åed here: POS is part of speech,\ntf is term frequency and idf is inverse document frequency.\nIn this section, I will describe Zaanen‚Äôs work Ô¨Årst ,and then\nmethod for incorporating POS information will be shown.\nFirst, Zaanen merges the lyrics in the training set belong-\ning to emotion ejinto a single document docj. In this way,\ndocument set D has been produced, with each document in\nthe set corresponding to one emotion class. As shown in\nequation 1, for a term ti,tfj(ti)represents the importance\nof atiin the expression of emotion ej.id f(ti)represents\nthe ability of a word in distinguishing different emotion as\nshown in equation 2.\ntfj(ti) =ni,j/summationtext\nknk,j(1)\nwhere ni,jis the count of term tiindocj.\nid f(ti) =|D|\n|{docj:ti‚ààdocj}|(2)\nThen lyrics lrclis represented by feature vector fvlas\nshown in equation 3. This feature vector is then used for\ntraining classiÔ¨Åer and making prediction.\nfvl= (f1, ..., f c)T(3)\nwhere cis the number of categories and each dimension\nof the vector is calculated by equation 4.\nfj=/summationdisplay\n{k|wk‚ààlrcl}tfj(wk)‚àóid f(wk) (4)\n76612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nWe know that words of different POS are different in the\nability to express emotion. For example, verbs and adjec-\ntives are more emotional than articles. In the following of\nthis section, I will describe the method for incorporating\nPOS information.\nBased on Zaanen‚Äôs feature model, we introduce a new\nfeature model which incorporates POS information in lyric-\ns. Instead of combining lyrics belonging to an emotion in-\nto one document, we combine them into several documents\nwith each document corresponding to one POS. For each\nPOS, we get four documents corresponding to the emotion\ntaxonomy just like Zaanen‚Äôs. We get a feature vector of four\ncomponents for each POS as shown in equation 5. Then we\nconcatenate them to form the Ô¨Ånal feature vector as shown\nin equation 6.\nfvl,POS = (f1,POS, ..., f c,POS )T(5)\nfvl= (f1,verb, ..., f c,verb, ..., f 1,noun, ..., f c,noun )T(6)\n4.2 rhyme\nA rhyme is a repetition of similar sounds in two or more\nwords and is most often used in poems and lyrics. Most\nChinese poems obey tail rhyme and lyrics of Chinese songs\nalso obey tail rhyme to some extent.\nRhyme is highly relevant to the emotion expression [1].\nBroad sounds such as [a] usually express happiness and ex-\ncitement while Ô¨Åne sounds such as [i] are related to gentle\nand sorrow. Broad sounds and Ô¨Åne sounds can be distin-\nguished by the level of obstruction in the vocal tract. Be-\nsides the difference between the broad and the Ô¨Åne, intona-\ntion also weighs a lot for the expression of emotion. Man-\ndarin has four tones:rises, falls, dips and stays.\nThere is a system of rhyme in old Chinese songs. It\nconsists of 19 main categories in terms of the broadness\nand Ô¨Åneness, meanwhile, each main category is divided into\nthree sub-categories by the tones. Then there are totally 57\nrhyme categories.\nWe propose a rhyme frequency(rf) feature based on the\nrhyme system mentioned above as shown in equation 7.\nrfv(lrcj) = (rf1,j, ..., rf 57,j)T(7)\nwhere\nrfi,j=ni,j/summationtext\nknk,j(8)\nThis metric measures the importance of rhyme riin lyric-\nslrcj, with ni,jdenoting the number of occurrences of the\ntail rhyme riinlrcj, divided by number of all tail rhyme\noccurrences in lrcj.5. COMBINATION APPROACH\nWe fusion these two sets of features on the features level\nand classiÔ¨Åers level. For the classiÔ¨Åers level fusion, both\nbase-learning combination method and meta-learning com-\nbination method are tried.\n5.1 Feature Level Fusion\nFor lyrics lrcl, we simply concatenate POS tf*idf feature\nvector and rhyme feature vector to create a new feature vec-\ntor as shown in equation 9.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n6.1 Experiment Settings\n6.1.1 Data set\nThe data set we use is the same as that used by Hu [15]. It\nis made up of 500 Chinese pop songs,and the emotions of\nthe songs are labeled through a subjective test conducted by\n8 participants. The lyrics of the songs are downloaded from\nthe web by a web crawler.\nThe distribution of the songs over the four emotion class-\nes is shown in Table 1. Although the number of songs in\nclass ‚Äô+V-A‚Äô is small, it conforms to the distribution in real-\nity.Method Baseline POS tf*idf Fuzzy Clustering\nF-measure(av.) 0.3886 0.5942 0.547\nTable 2 .

Rhyme classiÔ¨Åer has poor\nperformance on the whole, but it is better at dealing with\ninstances in ‚Äô-V ,-A‚Äô region. And those misclassiÔ¨Åed by the\nrhyme classiÔ¨Åer are corrected by the POS tf*idf classiÔ¨Åer.\nAs mentioned in section 5, fusion on features level and\nclassiÔ¨Åers level are tried. By comparing POS tf*idf column\nin table 3 and concatenation column in table 4, we Ô¨Ånd that\nfusion on features level fails to improve the result. For dif-\nferent features have different meanings, it‚Äôs not appropriate\nto concatenate them simply.\nFor fusion on the classiÔ¨Åers level, we try both base-learning\nand meta-learning for classiÔ¨Åer combination. We use weight-\ned average method for base-learning and stack generaliza-\ntion for meta-learning. From table 4, we Ô¨Ånd that the meta-\nlearning outperforms the base-learning by 0.1, which proves\nthe effectiveness of meta-learning in the task of classiÔ¨Åer\ncombination. Besides, the base-learning even lowers the f-\nmeasure compared to single classiÔ¨Åer based on POS tf*idf.\nSimple strategies could not guarantee the effectiveness of\ncombination.\n7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we present three main contributions. Firstly,\nwe get a great performance improvement in classiÔ¨Åcation of\nmusic emotion by extending the work of Zaanen. Secondly,\nwe propose to use rhyme cues in music emotion classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion to complement traditional word based features. Final-\nly,a meta-learning algorithm is used to combine classiÔ¨Åers\nbased on different features.\nThere are more to be explored with lyrics. New features\nsuch as the tone changes and the mental images can be ex-\ntracted from lyrics. Combining audio content,we can turn to\nthe Ô¨Åeld of multi-modal music emotion classiÔ¨Åcation.\n8.

INTRODUCTION \nMeasuring the similarity between two pieces of music is a \nfundamental but difficult task in Music Information Re-trieval (MIR) research [1] since music similarity is inher-ently based on human subjective point of view and can be bias among people who have different musical tastes and prior knowledge. A piece of musi c contains a variety of \nmusical contents, including the low-level audio signal; the metadata, such as the artist, album, song name, and release year; and a number of high-level perceptive descriptions, such as timbre, instrumentation, style/genre, mood, and so-cial information (e.g., tags, blogs, and explicit or implicit user feedback). Among the musical contents, only the au-dio signal is always available while the metadata and high-level perceptive descriptions are often unavailable or ex-\n                                                                          \nThis work was supported in part by the Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Ar-\nchives Program (TELDAP) sponsored by the National Science Council of Taiwan under Grant: NSC 100-2631-H-001-013. \n \n    pensive to obtain. Owing to the cold-start problem, measur-\ning the similarity between tw o pieces of audio music based \non their low-level acoustic features is critical to many MIR systems [2, 3]. These systems are usually evaluated against \nthe objective criteria derived from the metadata and high-level perceptive descriptions, which in fact correspond to the subjective criteria that humans use to measure music \nsimilarity. The similarity gap between the acoustic features and human subjective perceptions inevitably degrades the performances of the MIR systems. The gap may come from an insufficient song-level acoustic feature extraction or rep-resentation and an ill similarity metric. Therefore, the goal of improving audio-based music similarity computation is to reduce the gap between audio features and human per-ceptions, and it can be achieved from a music feature repre-sentation perspective [3-8] or a similarity learning perspec-tive [1, 10]. \nDue to the ‚Äúglass ceiling‚Äù of  performance that the pure \naudio-based music similarity computation systems have faced, several high-level perceptive descriptions, which are considered having a smaller gap between the similarity computed on them and the subjective similarity of human, have been employed in some previous work. For example, in [6, 7], an intermediate sema ntic space (e.g. genre or text \ncaption) is used to bridge and reduce the similarity gap. During recent years, social information has been very \npopular and become a major source of contextual knowl-edge for MIR systems. The social information generated by Internet users makes the ‚Äúwisdom of crowds‚Äù available for investigating the general criteria of human subjective music similarity. In [1], the music blogs are exploited to learn the music similarity metric of audi o features. In [8], the social \ntags are concatenated with th e audio features to represent \nmusic in a query-by-example MIR scenario. Furthermore, \nKim et al. [9] conduct explicit and implicit user feedback, which can be implemented by collaborative filtering (CF, the user-artist matrix), to measure artist similarity. Surpris-ingly, the experimental results show that CF can be a very efficient source in music similarity computation. After-wards, the CF data is used in [10] to learn the audio-based similarity metric and significant improvements in query-by-example MIR performance are ach ieved with three types of \nsong-level representations, namely, acoustic, auto-tag, and human-tag representations. \nPermission to make digital or hard copi es of all or part of this work fo r \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or  commercial advantage and that cop-\nies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Societ\ny for Music Information Retrieval \n85Poster Session 1\n  \n \nIn the abovementioned work, music tags are mostly \ntreated as part of music features to represent a song [8-10]. In this paper, we adopt music tags to create a ground truth semantic space to be used to measure human subjective \nsimilarity for three reasons. First, music tags are human la-bels that represent human mu sical perceptions. According \nto previous studies [9, 10], the similarity from tags is highly relative to the subjective similarity for evaluation, i.e., the similarity gap is relatively small. Second, music tags are free-text labels that include all kinds of musical information, such as genre, mood, instrumentation, personal preference, and metadata, which are used to  objectively evaluate the ef-\nfectiveness of audio-based similarity computation in previ-ous work. Third, music tags are generally considered noisy, redundant, bias, and unstable when collected from a com-pletely non-constrained tagging environment, such as last.fm. Consequently, several web-based music tagging games have been created with a purpose of collecting reli-able and useful tags, e.g., MajorMiner.org [12] and Tag A Tune [13]. In these tagging games, music clips are ran-domly assigned to taggers in order to reduce the tagging bias. Carefully extracting tags with high term frequencies and merging equivalent tags can intuitively reduce the noisy factors. With a set of well-refined music tags, the se-mantic space which simulates the human music similarity can be established. \nIn most audio-based MIR systems, the sequence of short-\ntime frame-based or segment-based acoustic feature vectors of a song is converted into a fixed-dimensional vector so that the song-level semantic descriptions (or tags) can be incorporated into it. The bag-of-frames (BOF) or bag-of-segments approach is a popular and efficient way to repre-sent a set of frame-based acoustic vectors of a song and has been widely used in MIR applications [8,10,14]. In the tra-ditional BOF approach, a set of frame representatives (e.g., codebook, denoted as an encoding reference hereafter) are selected or learned in an unsupervised manner, then a song is represented by the histogram over the encoding reference. \nIn the BOF representation vector, each dimension repre-\nsents the effective quantity of its corresponding frame rep-resentative (e.g., codeword) within a song. Based on the ef-fective quantities, we can estimate the audio-based similar-ity of two songs. Motivated by the metric learning for au-dio-based music similarity computation in [1,  10], we could \nlearn a metric transformation over the BOF representation vector by minimizing the similarity gap between acoustic features and music tags. Since the BOF vector is generated by the encoding reference, the minimization of similarity gap can be achieved by learning the encoding reference ra-ther than learning a metric transformation on the native BOF space. This leads to a supervised method for learning the encoding reference from a tagged music dataset to im-prove the BOF representation. Hopefully, the learned en-coding reference could better generalize the BOF modeling \nthan a stacking transformation over the native metric. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-\ntion 2 describes the audio feature extraction module and song-level BOF representation. In Section 3, we introduce the method for learning the encoding reference from the tagged music data. In Section 4, we evaluate the proposed method on the MajorMiner and Magnatagatune datasets in a query-by-example MIR scen ario. Finally, we summarize \nour conclusions in Section 5. \n2. BAG-OF-FRAMES REPRESENTATION FOR \nACOUSTIC FEATURES \n2.1 Frame-based Acoustic Feature Extraction \nWe use MIRToolbox 1.3 for acoustic feature extraction \n[14]. As shown in Table 1, we consider four types of fea-tures, namely, dynamic, spectral, timbre, and tonal features. To ensure alignment and preven t mismatch of different fea-\ntures in a vector, all the featur es are extracted with the same \nfixed-sized short-time frame. Given a song, a sequence of 70-dimensional feature vectors is extracted with a 50ms frame size and 0.5 hop shift. Then, we normalize the 70-dimensional frame-based featur e vectors in each dimension \nto mean 0 and standard deviation 1. \nTypes Feature Description Dim\ndynamic rms 1 \nspectral  centroid, spread, skewness, kurtosis, en-\ntropy, flatness, rolloff 85, rolloff 95, bright-ness, roughness, irregularity 11\ntimbre zero crossing rate, spectral flux, MFCC, \ndelta MFCC, delta-delta MFCC 41\ntonal key clarity, key mode possibility, HCDF, \nchroma , chroma peak, chroma centroid 17\nTable 1.  The music features used in the 70-dimensional frame-\nbased music feature vector. \n2.2 The Encoding Reference and BOF Representation \nThe BOF approach is argued that each frame of a song \nshould not be treated equally, and an isolated frame of low-level acoustic feature is not representative for high-level perceptive descriptions [15]. Besides, the effectiveness of BOF modeling is highly impacted by the size of encoding reference and will encounter a glass ceiling when the size is too large [16]. Our goal of improving the encoding refer-ence for BOF modeling is twofold: First, we aim at choos-ing a type of frame representative that gives better gener-alization ability and a more reliable distance measure crite-rion. Second, each frame repr esentative should not have \nequal information load during song-level encoding.  \nThe BOF modeling starts with generating the encoding \nreference from a set of available frames (denoted as F). \nThe frames are usually selected randomly and uniformly from each song in a music dataset. We use a Gaussian mix-ture model (GMM) instead of a codebook derived by the K-\nmean algorithm as the encoding reference [17]. In the \n8612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \nGMM, each component Gaussian  distribution, denoted as zk, \nk=1,‚Ä¶, K, corresponds to a frame representative. The GMM \nis trained on F by the expectation-maximization (EM) algo-\nrithm, and is expressed as follows: \n,),|( )(\n1‚àë\n==K\nkk k k kN p Œ£Œºv v œÄ           (1) \nwhere v is a frame-based feature vector, Nk(¬∑) is the k-th \ncomponent Gaussian distribution with mean vector Œºk and \ncovariance matrix Œ£k, and œÄk is the prior weight of the k-th \nmixture component. Given v, the posterior probability of a \nmixture component is computed by: \n.\n),|(),|() (\n1‚àë==K\nm m m m mk k k k\nkNNzp\nŒ£ŒºvŒ£Œºvv\nœÄœÄ   (2) \nGiven a song s with L frames, its BOF posterior-probability \nrepresentation (denoted as vector x) is computed by: \n,) (1) (\n1‚àë\n== ‚ÜêL\ntt k k k zpLszp x v                 (3) \nwhere xk is the k-th element in vector x. When encoding a \nframe by GMM, the posterior probability is based on the likelihood of each component Ga ussian distribution. The \nposterior probability of each mixture component yields a \nsoft-assigned encoding criterion which enhances the mod-eling ability of the GMM-based encoding reference over the vector-quantization-based (VQ-based) one. \nOur contention is that the diversity of frame representa-\ntives in the encoding referen ce is proportional to the ability \nof the BOF modeling, i.e., the BOF modeling can involve more audio information of a s ong to be encoded. However, \nlike other encoding references (e.g., a set of randomly se-lected vectors or a trained codebook), the GMM is gener-ated in an unsupervised manne r. The factors that we can \ncontrol includes the number of components in GMM, i.e., K, the types of acoustic featur es used in the frame-based \nvector, and the construction of F. Except for K, the other \ntwo factors are fixed in the beginning. As K increases, the \nframe representatives become more diverse, but some of them are in fact redundant. This motivates us to determine the importance of each frame re presentative in a discrimi-\nnative way. The EM training for GMM provides the esti-\nmation of the data distribution over F, which is assumed to \nfollow a mixture of Gaussian distributions, by the maxi-\nmum likelihood criterion. The prior \nœÄk of the k-th compo-\nnent Gaussian represents the corresponding effective num-\nber of frames in training set F. However, the construction \nof F implies that the estimated distribution of F actually \ndoes not have information about the song-level distribution of acoustic feature vectors. In other words, it may not re-flect the importance of each mixture component when en-\ncoding a song. In fact, as will be discussed later in Sec. 4, our experimental results show that setting the trained priors to a uniform distribution improves the MIR performance. In light of the observations described above and the ben-\neficial characteristics of music tags, we readily incorporate \nthe tagged music data as a supervision guide to determine the importance of each mixture component in the GMM.   \n3. LEARNING THE AUDIO-BASED SIMILARITY \nIn this work, learning the similarity of audio music from \ntagged music data is achieved by learning the encoding ref-erence to minimize the similarity gap between low-level acoustic features and high-level music tags. To this end, we conduct learning with respect to the parameters of the \nGMM trained from F. In this paper, we only consider the \nrelearning of the prior probabilities, i.e., the pre-learned pa-\nrameters Œº\nk and Œ£k, k=1,‚Ä¶, K, are fixed. The proposed itera-\ntive learning algorithm has two steps, namely, encoding \nsongs into BOF vectors and minimizing the similarity gap with respect to the prior probabilities of the GMM.  \n3.1 Preliminary \nSuppose there is a tagged music corpus D with N songs. \nGiven a song s\ni in D, we have its BOF vector xi‚ààRK√ó1, \nwhich is encoded by the GMM to represent the acoustic \nfeatures, and its tag vector yi‚àà{0,1}M√ó1, in which each tag \nis binary  labeled (multi-label case) from a pre-defined tag \nset with M tags. Two similarity matrices are defined: SX is \ncomputed on the N BOF vectors, and SY is computed on the \nN tag vectors. We estimate the acoustic similarity between \nsi and sj in D by computing the inner product of xi and xj. \nTherefore, the acoustic similarity matrix SX of D can be ex-\npressed as: \n,XXT\nXS=              (4) \nwhere X is a K-by-N matrix with xi as its i-th column. The \ntag similarity matrix SY of D is expressed as:   \n,YYT\nYS=             (5) \nwhere Y is an M-by-N matrix with yi‚àï||yi|| as its i-th col-\numn. Since each song may have different numbers of tags, \nto ensure that the tag-based similarity of a song itself is al-ways the largest, we compute the cosine similarity between \ny\ni and yj in Eq. (5) to estimate the tag-based similarity to \nsimulate the human similarity between si and sj. \nThe methods for audio-based similarity computation can \nbe evaluated by a query-by- example MIR system, i.e., \ngiven a query song with the audio signal only, the system ranks all the songs in the da tabase based on audio-based \nsimilarity computation only. To evaluate the effectiveness of S\nX, we perform leave-one-out  MIR tests to evaluate the \nnormalized discounted cumulative gain  (NDCG) [18] with \nrespect to the ground truth relevance derived by SY. That is, \neach song si in D is taken as a query song in turn, the out-\nput ranked list for si is generated by sorting the elements in \nthe i-th row of SX in descending order, and the correspond-\ning ground truth relevance is the i-th row of SY. The \n87Poster Session 1\n  \n \nNDCG i@P, which represents the quality of ranking of the \ntop P retrieved songs for query si, is formulated as follows: \n,log)()1(1@ NDCG\n2 2‚é≠‚é¨‚é´\n‚é©‚é®‚éß\n+ =‚àë\n=P\nji\ni\nPijjRRQP       (6) \nwhere Ri(j) is the ground truth relevance (obtained from the \ni-th row of SY) of the j-th song on the ranked list, and QP is \nthe normalization term representing the ideal ranking of the P songs [18]. Intuitively, if more songs with large ground \ntruth relevance are ranked higher, a larger NDCG will be \nobtained. The query-by-example MIR performance on D \nbased on S\nX with respect to SY is evaluated by  \n.@1)@ NDCG(\n1‚àë\n==N\niiP NDCGNPD   (7) \nThe larger NDCG in Eq. (7) is, the more effective the audio \nsimilarity computation for SX is. \n3.2 Minimizing the Similarity Gap \nWe define a K-by-K symmetric transformation matrix W \nfor the BOF vector space. The transformed BOF vector for \nsi is expressed by Wx i, and the new acoustic similarity ma-\ntrix ST of D can be obtained by: \n, ) () ( TXX WX WXT T\nTS = =           (8) \nwhere T=WTW. Therefore, minimizing the similarity gap \nbetween the transformed BOF vector space and human tag vector space is equivalent to  minimizing the distance or \nmaximizing the correlation [19] between the two kernel \nmatrices S\nT and SY with respect to W. In this paper, moti-\nvated by the work in [20], we express the N songs in D as \ntwo random vectors, Zx‚ààRN√ó1 for the transformed acoustic \nfeature and Zy‚ààRN√ó1 for the tag label, which follow two \nmultivariate Gaussian distributions Nx and Ny, respectively. \nThere exists a simple bijection between the two multivari-ate Gaussians. Without loss of generality, we assume N\nx \nand Ny have an equal mean and are parameterized by ( Œº, ST) \nand ( Œº, SY), respectively. Then, the ‚Äúcloseness‚Äù between Nx \nand Ny can be measured by the relative entropy KL( Nx || Ny) \n(i.e., the KL-divergence), which is equivalent to d(ST || SY):   \n{} ,  | |log) (  21)||(1 1N SS SStr S SdYT YT Y T ‚àí ‚àí =‚àí ‚àí     (9) \nwhere tr(¬∑) and |¬∑| are the trace and determinant of a matrix, \nrespectively. The minimization of d(ST || SY) can be solved \nby setting the derivative of d(ST || SY) with respect to T to \nzero. The solution that minimizes d(ST || SY) is as follows: \n () . )(11 *‚àí‚àí=T\nYS X X T    (10) \nSince W is symmetric, the optimal matrix W is derived by \n.)(21* *T W=            (11) \nTo prevent singularity, a small value 0.001 is added to each \ndiagonal element of the matrices  that are inversed in solv-ing W. If we restrict W in Eq. (8) to be diagonal, i.e., we \nignore the correlation among diffe rent dimensions in the \nBOF vector, and define vector w ‚â° diag( W), the optimal w* \nis the diagonal of W*: \n),(diag* *W w=              (12) \nwhere each element in w* must be greater than zero. The \nderivations of Eqs. (10) and (12) are skipped due to the \nspace limitation. \nIn the testing phase, each song is first encoded into a \nBOF vector by the GMM using Eq. (3). Then, the audio-based similarity between any two songs s\ni and sj is com-\nputed as xiTT*xj, where T* can be a full or diagonal matrix \naccording to the initial setting of W in Eq. (8). In the ex-\nperiments, this method with full transformation and diago-\nnal transformation is denoted as FullTrans and DiagTrans respectively, while the method without transformation is denoted as OrigGMM (i.e., the native GMM). \n3.3\n Relearning the Priors of the GMM \nInstead of learning a transfor mation matrix, we can also \nminimize the similarity gap by relearning the prior weights of the GMM. We propose a two-step iterative learning method, which iteratively updates the prior weights of the GMM until convergence. The NDCG in Eq. (7) can be used as the criterion for ch ecking the convergence of the \nlearning procedure. The minimization of similarity gap im-plies the improvement in NDCG since the learned S\nT tries \nto preserve the structure of SY, which is used as the ground \ntruth relevance in computing NDCG. If NDCG is no longer improved, the learning algorithm stops. The learning method is summarized in Algorithm 1. \nAccording to Algorithm 1, ther e are two steps in an itera-\ntion. Line 05 corresponds to th e first step, which encodes \nall songs into their BOF vectors; and lines 11 and 13 corre-spond to the second step, which minimizes the similarity gap with respect to the prio r weights of the GMM. Since \nencoding all songs in \nD is a complicated procedure, di-\nrectly optimizing NDCG with respect to the parameters of the GMM with Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) is infeasible. Therefore, \nwe turn to find an indirect so lution that minimizes the simi-\nlarity gap with respect to th e priors of the GMM. We ex-\nploit the property of w\n* to derive Eq. (13), which serves as \nan indirect optimizer for maximizing the NDCG( D)@N by \nreweighting the prior weights of the GMM. In tuitively, the \nvector w* derived in line 11 plays a role to select mixture \ncomponents in the GMM.  \nIn the testing phase, each song is encoded into a BOF \nvector by the GMM with the relearned prior weights using Eq. (3). Then, the audio-base d similarity between any two \nsongs s\ni and sj is computed as the inner product of xi and xj , \nwithout the need to apply an y stacking transformation in \nthe BOF space. In the experiments, the proposed method implemented in this way is denoted as DiagGMM. \n8812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n4. EVALUATIONS \n4.1 Datasets \nWe evaluate the proposed method on the MajorMiner and \nMagnatagatune datasets in a query-by-example MIR sce-nario. Both datasets are generated from social tagging \ngames with a purpose (GWAP) [11, 12] to collect reliable and useful tag labels. The MajorMiner dataset has been a well-known benchmark in MIREX since 2008. The one used in this paper is crawled from the MajorMiner website in March 2011. It contains 2,472 10-second music clips and \n1,031 raw tags. After exacting the high frequency tags and \nmerging the redundant tags, 76 tags are left. The Magnata-\ngatune dataset [12], which contains 25,860 30-second au-\ndio clips and 188 pre-processe d tags, is downloaded from \n[21]. To construct \nF, we randomly select 25% and 2% of \nframes from the two datasets, respectively. For MajorMiner, \nF contains 235,000 frames, while for Magnatagatune, F \ncontains 535,800 frames. The F constructed in this way is \nblind to song-level information.  To prevent bias in the tag-\nbased similarity computation of SY, we ignore the clips la-\nbeled with fewer tags. For the MajorMiner dataset, 1,200 clips having at least 5 tags ar e left. For the Magnatagatune \ndataset, 3,764 clips having at  least 7 tags are left. \n4.2\n Experimental Results and Discussions \nIn the experiments, we repeat  three-fold cross-validation 10 \ntimes on the MajorMiner dataset, which is divided into three folds at random. In each run, two folds are used for \ntraining the transformation matr ix of the FullTrans and Di-\nagTrans methods or relearning the prior weights of the GMM for the DiagGMM method, while the remaining fold, which serves as both the test queries and the target data-\nbase to retrieve , is used for the leave-one-out  audio-based \nMIR outside test. For the Magnatagatune dataset, all clips have been divided into 16 folds to prevent that two or more \nclips originated from the same song occur in different folds. \nWe merge the 16 folds into 4 folds and perform four-fold cross-validation. The NDCG@ P in Eq. (7) is used as the \nevaluation metric in both in side and outside tests.  \nFirst, we examine the lear ning process of DiagGMM on \nthe MajorMiner dataset. Figure 1 shows an example learn-ing curve in terms of NDCG for one of the three-fold cross-validation runs. The curve is equivalent to the inside test  \nperformance evaluated on the training data. We can see that the learning curve of DiagGMM ( K=256) increases mono-\ntonically till convergence, although DiagGMM can only improve the NDCG of the training data indirectly as dis-cussed in Section 3.3. Diag GMM gains an absolute in-\ncrease of 0.04 in NDCG@10 and 0.002 in NDCG@800. The NDCG of FullTrans can be considered an upper bound for DiagGMM since it adopts a di rect optimization strategy.  \nNext, we evaluate OrigG MM and the VQ-based method \non the MajorMiner dataset. Ther e is no need to divide the \ndata into three folds since no supervised learning is in-\nvolved in the methods.  From the MIR results shown in Ta-ble 2, we observe that replacing the priors of the GMM \ntrained from \nF with a uniform distribution enhances the \nperformance. We also observe  that, even with a large K, \nOrigGMM outperforms VQ-based BOF modeling. The re-sults demonstrate the better modeling ability of the GMM over the K-means derived codebook. \nFinally, we compare DiagGMM with three baselines, i.e., \nFullTrans, DiagTrans, and Orig GMM. The results of three-\nfold cross-validation on the Ma jorMiner dataset are shown \nin Figure 2, while the results of four-fold cross-validation \non the Magnatagatune dataset are shown in Figure 3. From Figures 2 and 3, it is obvious that the proposed DiagGMM outperforms all other methods in most cases. The conven-\ntional BOF approach does face a glass ceiling when K is Algorithm 1.

The proposed DiagGMM en-hances the performance over the glass ceiling of OrigGMM with a smaller \nK, e.g., DiagGMM with K=512 outperforms \nOrigGMM with K=2,048 on the MajorMiner dataset. Full-\nTrans outperforms DiagTrans and DiagGMM only when K \nis small. However, FullTrans tends to saturate early since it has more parameters to train and thus requires more train-\ning data, compared with Diag Trans and DiagGMM. In Fig-\nure 1, the performance of FullTrans shows an upper bound of DiagGMM in inside test; however, in outside test, DiagGMM outperforms FullTrans except when \nK is small. \nThe experimental results in Fi gures 2 and 3 demonstrate the \nexcellent generalization ability of DiagGMM, which learns the similarity of audio music by relearning the priors of the GMM instead of a transformati on in the BOF vector space. \n5. CONCLUSIONS  \nIn this paper, we have addr essed a novel research direction \nthat the audio-based music similarity computation can be learned by minimizing the similarity gap or maximizing the NDCG measure with respect to the parameters of the en-coding reference in BOF repr esentation. We have imple-\nmented the idea by learning the prior weights of the GMM from tagged music data. The e xperimental results demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which gives a potential to guide MIR systems that employ BOF representation, e.g., the Di agGMM can be directly com-\nbined with the codeword Be rnoulli average (CBA) method \n[13], a well-known automatic music tagging method.  \n6.

INTRODUCTION\nAs the rapid growth of music items on the Internet, music\nstyle analysis such as music classiÔ¨Åcation and clustering\nhas become increasingly prevalent in music information\nretrieval research. Traditional methods usually focus on\naudio feature extraction and acoustic content analysis. For\nexample, Pampalk et al. [19] integrate different similari-\nty sources based on Ô¨Çuctuation patterns and use a nearest\nneighbor classiÔ¨Åer to categorize music items. Chen and\nChen [3] apply both long-term and short-term features and\nuses support vector machines to classify music genres.\nMore recently, methods utilizing music social tags have\nemerged and have been receiving more and more atten-\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies\nare not made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that\ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.tion. Social tags are free-text descriptions added by user-\ns to express their personal views and interests in music\nitems such as songs, artists, albums, and playlists. The\ntags provide direct insights into user behavior and opin-\nions and the retrieval methods using tags have been shown\nto be more effective than the traditional methods solely\nbased on music content analysis [14,24,27]. For example,\nBischoff et al. [2] demonstrate that different types of so-\ncial tags can improve music search. Symeonidis et al. [23]\npropose a music recommendation algorithm using a user-\ntag-item tensor. Wang et al. [26] show the effectiveness of\ntag features by way of joint analysis of tags and contents.\nAlthough the content-based and tag-aware methods are\nsuccessful in many music information retrieval applica-\ntions, they make a somewhat curious assumption that mu-\nsic items are independent of each other, which is not al-\nways true. In this paper, we assume that music items are\nrelated to each other and try to establish relations among\nthem by discovering relationships among artists. To do\nthis we look for the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù information on Twitter\nand construct a linked graph to represent the artist so-\ncial network. We then propose a novel tag-aware music\nstyle clustering system utilizing this network by way of\nmatrix factorization. By assuming that the ‚Äúfollower‚Äù re-\nlationship as represented in the social network thus build\nis transitive, we can capture indirect relationships among\nthe artists, which are usually ignored in the existing music\nstyle clustering methods.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\ndiscusses the related work. Section 3 introduces our pro-\nposed approaches for constructing the artist social graph,\ngenerating artist relation matrix, and clustering using rela-\ntion matrix based factorization. We conduct experiments\non a real world data set and Section 4 presents the experi-\nmental results. Section 5 gives an conclusion and discuss-\nes the future work.\n435Poster Session 3\n2. RELATED WORK\nAutomatic music analysis such as music item clustering,\nclassiÔ¨Åcation, and similarity search has been playing a\ncentral role in music information retrieval. Traditional au-\ntomatic music analysis methods usually focus only on au-\ndio content analysis via audio feature extraction. Timbral\ntexture features [25] are the most widely used features,\nwhich usually consist of Short-Term Fourier Transform\n(STFT) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral CoefÔ¨Åcients (MFC-\nC) [21]. Various data mining and statistical methods have\nbeen applied to such features for classiÔ¨Åcation and clus-\ntering of music items, such as artists, songs, and album-\ns [3, 4, 6, 12, 20, 25].\nAnalysis of music social tags is a subject quickly gain-\ning popularity in music information retrieval research.\nMusic social tags are free-text descriptions of any length\n(though in practice there sometimes is a limit in terms of\nnumber of characters) with no restriction on the words to\nbe used. Because they are free texts, they are thought of\nas representing feelings of listeners on the music items\n(artists, songs, etc.) for which they leave tags. Also, be-\ncause they are free texts, they range from a single character\n(e.g., ‚Äú!‚Äù) to a full sentence (e.g., ‚ÄúI love you baby, can I\nhave some more?‚Äù). However, in many cases, they are one\nor two words, such as ‚ÄúSad‚Äù, ‚ÄúHappy‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlack Metal‚Äù,\n‚ÄúLoved it‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIndie Pop‚Äù. As can be easily seen social\ntags include words that do not necessarily appear as labels\nexperts such as musicologists provide. Their amateurism\nnotwithstanding, by collecting a large number of tags for\none single piece of music item, an understanding can be\nobtained on how the general listeners appreciate the item.\nWith that idea, work has been done to show the promise of\nusing tags for music data analysis. For example, Lamere\nand Pampalk [15] use tags to enhance simple search, sim-\nilarity analysis, and clustering of music items. Lehwark\net al. [17] generate visual clustering of tagged music da-\nta. Karydis et al. [13] propose a tensor-based algorithm to\ncluster music items using 3-way relational data involving\nsong, users, and tags. The effectiveness of tags may come\nfrom the fact that the distance between the original data\nsource and the tag in terms of informativeness appears to\nbe much smaller. There also exist a few efforts in combin-\ning content-based and tag-based analysis. For example,\nF. Wang et al. [27] attempts to integrate audio contents and\ntags for multi-label classiÔ¨Åcation of music styles. D. Wang\net al. [26] explores the integration of music content and\ntags in the problem of artist style clustering.\nIn addition to social tags, much more social informa-\ntion has become available on the Internet. For instance,\nsocial networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace,and a social medium Twitter can provide the friendship\ninformation among users by adding a friend on Facebook\nor following a tweet page on Twitter. Recent work by\nAnglade et al. [1] uses complex network theoretic analysis\nto group similar listeners. Jacobson et al. [11] and Fields\net al. [8] study the inÔ¨Çuence of social networks for the mu-\nsic community detection and playlists generation. In this\npaper, we explore the effectiveness of the joint use of the\nanalysis of the social networking graph and the tag-based\nmusic style clustering.\n3. METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Framework\nFigure 3.1 shows the framework of our proposed music\nstyle clustering system that integrates tag and social graph\nanalysis. Given a collection of representative music pieces\nfrom different artists, we Ô¨Årst obtain the tags describing\nthese music pieces to construct a music-tag matrix and\ngenerate the social networking graph among the artists,\nfrom which the artist relation matrix is created. We then\nperform matrix factorization on the music-tag matrix us-\ning artist relation matrix as the base. Upon the conver-\ngence of the factorization, we can obtain the music style\nindicator matrix and Ô¨Ånally partition the music pieces into\ndifferent style groups.\nmusicÕ≤tag\u0003representationartist\u0003social\u0003graphartist\u0003relation\u0003matrix\nfactorization\u0003using\u0003artist\u0003relation matrix as bases\nrelation\u0003matrix\u0003as\u0003basesartistÕ≤style\u0003cluster\u0003tagÕ≤style\u0003cluster\u0003indicatorindicator\nFigure 1 . The framework of the proposed method.\n3.2 Artist Social Graph Construction\nIn order to construct an artist social graph, we select 327\nartists that are active users of Twitter. The genres cov-\nered these artists are Pop, Jazz, Rock, Hip Hop, and Coun-\n43612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ntry. Each node of the graph represents an artist. For these\nartists we extract the ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù information among these\nartists using the API provided by Twitter. If artist Aiis\n‚Äúfollowing‚Äù the tweets of artist Aj, there will be a directed\nlink from node Aito nodeAj. An example of the gener-\nated social graph is shown in Figure 2.\nRihannaNicki Minaj\nKaty\u0003Perry\nPink\nLady\u0003Gaga\nBruno\u0003Mars\nTaylor\u0003Swift\nBritney\u0003Spears\nFigure 2 . An Example Social Graph Generated from\nTwitter.\n3.3 Artist Relation Matrix Generation\nBased on the artist social graph, we can generate the artist\nrelation matrix which considers both the direct and indi-\nrect relationships using the method proposed in [9]. Sup-\npose that artist Aiis followed by a set of artists Fi, a\nmatrixSto represent the direct relationships among the\nartists can be computed in this way:\nSji=/braceleftBigg\n1/|Fi|ifAj‚ààFi\n0otherwise,\nwhere|Fi|is the size of set Fi. To capture the indirect\nrelationships, we perform a random walk on the directed\ngraph denoted by S. An artist can be identiÔ¨Åed as a relat-\ned one if the random walk stops at the node representing\nhim/her. A parameter Œ±is used to specify the probability\nthat the random walk stops at the current node which is set\nto 0.99 in the experiments, and based on the properties of\nrandom walk, the relation matrix can be computed as\nB= (1‚àíŒ±)(1‚àíŒ±S)‚àí1.\n3.4 Factorization with Artist Relation Base Matrix\n3.4.1 the Model\nIn order to obtain the music style clusters, we perform ma-\ntrix tri-factorization [7] using the artist relation matrix asthe base matrix. The problem can be treated as an opti-\nmization problem with the following objective:\nmin\nB‚â•0,U‚â•0,V‚â•0||X‚àíBUVT||,s.t.UTU=I,VTV=I,\nwhereXdenotes the artist-tag matrix, and Bis the gen-\nerated artist relation matrix as described in Section 3.3.\nFromU, we can obtain the artist-style clusters, and from\nVwe can get the tag-style clusters. To solve this opti-\nmization problem, we use an algorithm similar to the tri-\nfactorization [7] and nonnegative matrix factorization (N-\nMF) [16] to iteratively update UandVas follows:\nUas‚ÜêUas[CBTV]as\nVts‚ÜêVts[BDTU]ts,\nwhereCij =Xij/[UVTB]ij, andDij =\nXij/[BUVT]ij. Different with the traditional tri-\nfactorization approach, here we use the social relation\nmatrix as the base matrix to incorporate social networking\ninformation among the artists, and the base matrix is Ô¨Åxed\nduring the updates of the other two matrices. The beneÔ¨Åt\nof using the base matrix is that the artist relations obtained\nfrom the social media can be naturally incorporated to\nguide the factorization procedures.\n3.4.2 Computational Algorithm\nIn the algorithm derivation, we follow the Expectation-\nMaximization (EM) procedure to maximize the marginal-\nized likelihood of observations by iteratively updating the\nartist-style and tag-style matrices until convergence. The\ncomputational algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.\n3.4.3 Algorithm Correctness\nNow we prove the loss /lscript(U,V)is nonincreasing under the\nupdate rules.\nProof LetŒ±iklj=Bik/tildewideUkl/tildewideVjl/[B/tildewideU/tildewideVT]ij.

We\ncan verify that the update rules keep UandVnon-\nnegative.\n4. EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Data Collection\nFor experimental purpose, we select 327 most popular\nartists of the following 5 styles: Pop (91 artists), Rock (67\nartists), Country (55 artists), Jazz (48 artists), and Hip Hop\n(66 artists). We use the API provided by Twitter to check\nif there is a ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù relationship among these artists.The style information and tags of the artists are collected\nfrom Last.fm (http://www.last.fm).\n4.2 Implemented Baselines\nWe implement the following baselines to compare them\nwith our proposed method which integrating the social\ntags and the social networking graph.\n‚Ä¢K-means - performs standard K-means clustering\non the artist-tag matrix.\n‚Ä¢Normalized Cuts (Ncut) [28] - conducts graph-\nbased spectral clustering using normalized cuts.\n‚Ä¢Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [16] - per-\nforms nonnegative matrix factorization on the artist-\ntag matrix to obtain the artist-style matrix from\nwhich the artist cluster assignments can be obtained.\n‚Ä¢Tri-factorization (Tri-fac) [7] - performs tri-\nfactorization on the artist-tag matrix.\n‚Ä¢Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) [10]\n- performs PLSI on the artist-tag matrix.\n‚Ä¢PLSI+PHITS [5] - combines the tag-based analy-\nsis with social graph using PLSI plus Probabilistic\nHyperlink-Induced Topic Search (PHITS).\nThese baseline methods that we use in the experiments\nare most widely used clustering algorithms and some new\nemerged methods combing content and link analysis in da-\nta mining, information retrieval, and social network anal-\nysis areas. We aim to compare our proposed models with\nthe state-of-the-art methods for artist clustering.\n4.3 Evaluation Methods\nTo measure the artist style clustering performance, we use\naccuracy and normalized mutual information (NMI) as\nperformance measures.\n‚Ä¢Accuracy measures the relationship between each\ncluster and the ground truth class. It sums up the\ntotal matching degree between all pairs of clusters\nand classes. Accuracy can be represented as:\nAccuracy =Max (/summationdisplay\nCk,LmT(Ck,Lm))/N,\nwhereCkdenotes the k-th cluster, and Lmis the\nm-th class. T(Ck,Lm)is the number of entities\nwhich belong to class m and are assigned to cluster\nk. Accuracy computes the maximum sum of\n43812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nT(Ck,Lm)for all pairs of clusters and classes, and\nthere is no overlap among these pairs. It is obvious\nthat the greater accuracy, the better clustering\nperformance.\n‚Ä¢NMI [22] measures the amount of statistical infor-\nmation shared by two random variables represent-\ning cluster assignment and underlying class label.\nSuppose entry nijdenotes the amount of data item-\ns belonging to cluster iand classj. NMI is then\ncomputed as:\nNMI =/summationtextc\ni=1/summationtextk\nj=1nij\nnlognijn\nni.n.j/radicalBig\n(/summationtextc\ni=1‚àíni.\nnlogni.\nn)(/summationtextk\nj=1‚àín.j\nnlogn.j\nn),\nwhereni.=/summationtextk\nj=1nij,n.j=/summationtextc\ni=1nij,n,c,k\ndenote the total number of data objects, the number\nof clusters, and the number of classes, respectively.\nBased on our prior knowledge of the number of\nclasses, we set the number of clusters equal to the\ntrue number of classes, i.e., c=k.\n4.4 Experimental Results\nFigure 3 and Figure 4 show the accuracy and NMI results\nof different clustering methods respectively.\nK√Ømeans Ncuts NMF Tri√Øfac PLSI PLSI+PHITS Ours00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.45Accuracy\nFigure 3 .

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we explore the potential beneÔ¨Åts of integrat-\ning tags and social networking graphs in music style clus-\ntering. Given a collection of artists and their representative\nmusic pieces, social tags of free languages are extracted to\ndescribe the music pieces. The direct and indirect rela-\ntionships among the artists are also discovered from the\nartist social networking graph, which is generated from\npopular social media sites, such as Twitter. Then a fac-\ntorization based algorithm is derived to make use of both\nthe two types of information. Experimental results on real\nworld data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod.\n439Poster Session 3\nThis is a pilot study of incorporating social networking\nanalysis into music style clustering, and the initial results\nshow the promising future of research in this direction.\nIn the future work, large-scale data sets will be collected\nand further experiments will be performed on them. We\nwill also discover other meaningful and useful types of\ninformation and examine if they can facilitate the task of\nmusic style analysis.\n6.

A focus on the\nuser has repeatedly been identiÔ¨Åed as a key requirement for\nfuture MIR research; yet empirical user studies have been\nrelatively sparse in the literature, the overwhelming research\nattention in MIR remaining systems-focused.

INTRODUCTION\nDespite recurring calls for a greater focus on user-centric\nresearch, work in the Ô¨Åeld of Music Information Retrieval\n(MIR) has been largely systems-focused. This paper reports\non the limited but growing body of user studies in the Ô¨Åeld.\nA broad deÔ¨Ånition of ‚Äòuser study‚Äô is employed in the article\nselection: qualifying documents report on empirical inves-\ntigations of user requirements or interactions with systems\nprimarily aimed at providing access to musical information,\nincluding musical recordings, scores, lyrics, photography\nand artwork, and other associated metadata.\nThe goals of this review are threefold: to survey the dis-\ntinct topics that have been investigated by user studies in the\nÔ¨Åeld; to provide an overview of the research methodologies\nemployed in these studies; and to report on implications for\nMIR systems design offered by the works covered.\n2. SYSTEMS-CENTRIC FOCUS IN MIR\nResearch activity in MIR has been motivated to some extent\nby textual Information Retrieval (IR)‚Äîa Ô¨Åeld of research\ndating back to the 1950‚Äôs. Plans for an evaluation platform\ninspired by TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) [37] were\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.under discussion from ISMIR‚Äôs early days [13], and even-\ntually led to the creation of MIREX, the Music Information\nRetrieval Evaluation eXchange [14]. Given this emulation\nof early developments in the Ô¨Åeld of textual lR, it is perhaps\nunsurprising that the primary emphasis of research in MIR\nhas been placed on systems development. Formal consider-\nation of user information needs and information behaviour\nhas been sparse in comparison. This imbalance is problem-\natic: a lack of grounding in user requirements makes the\nreal-world applicability of developed MIR systems a matter\nof speculation [2]. The situation reÔ¨Çects the early state of\nresearch in the Ô¨Åeld of textual IR, where similar early em-\nphasis on information systems gradually gave way to a more\nuser-centric paradigm [10, 38].\nArticles reÔ¨Çecting on the state of MIR have repeatedly\ncalled for a greater focus on the potential users of MIR sys-\ntems [13]. In his wide-ranging summary of the early state\nof the Ô¨Åeld, Downie identiÔ¨Åes the ‚Äòmultiexperiential chal-\nlenge‚Äô to MIR [11]: subjective musical experience varies\nnot only between, but also within individuals, depending on\naffective and cultural context, associations between the mu-\nsic and events from episodic memory, and a host of other\nfactors.\nUsers‚Äô information needs vary accordingly; an ethno-\nmusicologist‚Äôs analytical requirements are likely served by\nqueries of a different nature to those used by a party host\ncompiling a playlist. Core IR concepts such as ‚Äòsimilarity‚Äô\nand ‚Äòrelevance‚Äô may also be variably deÔ¨Åned: ‚Äòsimilarity‚Äô\nmight, for instance, refer to song structure, or to mood con-\nveyed; ‚Äòrelevance‚Äô to a tune‚Äôs bibliographical Ô¨Åt to a key-\nword query, or to its applicability to a given use case (e.g.,\n‚Äòdriving,‚Äô ‚Äòhousework,‚Äô or ‚Äòexercise‚Äô).\nDesign decisions have typically been based on ‚Äúintuitive\nfeelings for user information seeking behaviour,‚Äù [8] ‚Äúanec-\ntodal evidence and a priori assumptions of typical usage sce-\nnarios‚Äù [25] when facing such issues. User studies, con-\nducted with the same empirical rigour and research excel-\nlence we have come to expect from systems-based research,\ncan provide valuable insights for MIR researchers and de-\nvelopers, resulting in more useful systems for MIR users\nand greater ecological validity in research Ô¨Åndings.\n335Oral Session 5: User Studies\n3. REVIEW OF USER STUDIES IN THE MIR\nLITERATURE\n3.1 Selection Strategy\nThe criteria employed in article selection for this review\nemploy a broad deÔ¨Ånition of the term ‚Äòuser study‚Äô, as de-\nscribed above. Articles primarily reporting the results of\nsuch user studies were targeted for inclusion. The ISMIR\nCloud Browser [16] served as a starting point for article dis-\ncovery; this textual information retrieval tool is capable of\ngenerating visualisations and ranked result lists based on a\nuser query, using a TF ¬∑IDF-based metric [40] to match the\nquery to a set of 719 articles representing the output of the\nÔ¨Årst decade of ISMIR-related activity. Results from the fol-\nlowing query strings were used: ‚Äúhuman responses‚Äù; ‚Äúinfor-\nmation behaviour‚Äù; ‚Äúinformation use‚Äù; ‚Äúinformation need‚Äù;\n‚Äúparticipants‚Äù; ‚Äúperceptual evaluation‚Äù; ‚Äúrespondents‚Äù; ‚Äúus-\nability‚Äù; ‚Äúuser study‚Äù; and ‚Äúuser testing‚Äù.\nAdditional articles were identiÔ¨Åed through a search on\nthe ISI Web of Knowledge database using the query string\n‚Äú‚Äòmusic information retrieval‚Äô AND user‚Äù; by following ci-\ntations in the resultant documents; and by searching for ar-\nticles citing the original documents using Google Scholar.\n3.2 Research Topics\nA number of different aspects of music information be-\nhaviour have been investigated. The topics have been for-\nmulated here by reference to explicit research questions,\nwhere provided, or by the implied aims of the research:\n‚Ä¢User requirements and information needs [1, 30];\n‚Ä¢The information needs of speciÔ¨Åc groups [9, 17‚Äì19]\nand in speciÔ¨Åc contexts [7];\n‚Ä¢Insights into speciÔ¨Åc aspects of music perception and\npreference, such as the factors that cause listeners to\ndislike certain songs [5], the impact of social relations\non music acquisition and taste [23], and the effects of\ndemographic factors and musical background on the\nsemantic descriptions of music [26, 27];\n‚Ä¢Analyses of textual MIR queries‚Äîsymbolic represen-\ntation of the melody sought [34], and natural language\nexpressions of music information needs [1, 25];\n‚Ä¢Employment of user studies to generate ground-truth\ndata for use in training and evaluation corpora [31‚Äì\n33].\n‚Ä¢The organisation of digital music information [6, 17];\n‚Ä¢Search strategies and relevance criteria used when ac-\ntively seeking new music [22, 24];\n‚Ä¢Information behaviour in passive or serendipitous en-\ncounters with new music [4];3.3 Methodologies\nThe research methodologies employed in the user studies\nare predominantly qualitative in nature. Approaches range\nfrom situated-researcher methodologies, such as ethno-\ngraphic observation of information behaviour, face-to-face\nuser interviews, and participatory design panels, to more re-\nmote methodologies such as diary studies, online surveys,\nand query log analyses.\nThe emphasis on qualitative methodology reÔ¨Çects the\nlargely exploratory nature of existing research; only a few\nstudies take quantitative or mixed approaches, by quantita-\ntive analysis of natural language user queries [25], by ap-\nplying measures from usability engineering [34], by use of\nbehavioural studies [21, 36], and by systematic analyses of\ndemographic factors and musical background [26]. A fur-\nther group of studies employs quantitative approaches to-\nwards the systems-centric goal of corpus generation, crowd-\nsourcing annotations from large quantities of users com-\npetiting in music-related online games [31‚Äì33].\nThe relatively small number of user studies is reÔ¨Çected\nin the equally small number of researchers involved. Conse-\nquently, many studies have used somewhat uniform partici-\npant pools, consisting predominantly of male subjects from\nsimilar backgrounds. Several studies do take precautions to\nensure more representative sampling: for instance, Taheri-\nPanah and MacFarlane [30] recruit participants from 3 dis-\ntinct age-bands, balancing gender; and Lesaffre et al. [26]\nmake the effect of demographic context on the perception\nand description of music a research priority in a large scale,\ncross-sectional study.\nThe limited number of researchers has also resulted in\na somewhat homogeneous use of research methodologies;\nthe majority of the user studies in the Ô¨Åeld have been qual-\nitative in nature, usually making use of Grounded Theory\n(GT) in the analysis phase [15]. GT is an approach in which\nobservations are coded with no prior assumptions, allowing\ntheory to emerge from the data. GT is relied upon exclu-\nsively in the data analysis phases of many of the articles\ncovered [1, 4‚Äì8, 22, 24].\nGT is an appropriate tool in exploratory research, where\nno conceptual models have been established to aid data anal-\nysis. As such, these studies represent valuable work; how-\never, there is a clear opportunity for further research to build\na conceptual framework informed by the existing results, by\nconducting further qualitative research to pin down the re-\nquired concepts, or by pursuing quantitative work to identify\nwhether existing results can be generalized.\nA notable exception is presented by Inskip, Butterworth,\n& MacFarlane‚Äôs study into the information needs of users of\na folk music library (2008) [17]; here, qualitative, face-to-\nface interviews are analysed in line with Nicholas‚Äô frame-\nwork for evaluating information need (2000) [29]. The re-\nsearchers are thus able to base their results on an established\n33612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nanalytical tool, while at the same time validating the appli-\ncability of the tool in a new context.\n3.4 Recommendations for MIR System Design\nWhile the studies presented in this review are concerned\nwith user requirements and information behaviour, a pri-\nmary goal of such research is to inform the development of\ninformation systems to better meet such requirements and\nsupport such behaviours. Over the last decade, researchers\nhave built an arsenal of algorithms and components to tackle\nvarious aspects of MIR; however, the Ô¨Åeld has yet to pro-\nduce an integrated, full-featured system, tying together these\nvarious capabilities. Accomplishing this has been described\nas the ‚ÄúGrand Challenge‚Äù of ISMIR‚Äôs second decade [13]\n(p. 18). By conducting user-centric research and applying\nÔ¨Åndings to the design of such a system and its components,\nwe can ‚Äúimprove the quality of the community‚Äôs research\noutput‚Äù and help create ‚Äútruly useful music-IR systems‚Äù (p.\n17).\nThe recommendations and implications for MIR systems\nconcluded by the studies covered in the review originate\nfrom a number of different contexts, e.g., digital libraries\nversus personal collections. Thus, not all of the recom-\nmendations are necessarily applicable to the same system;\nrather, provided here is an overview of the recommendations\navailable, in order to guide future development efforts.\n3.4.1 Undirected Browsing\nUsers spend much of their time seeking new music updating\nand expanding their musical knowledge, without a speciÔ¨Åc\ngoal in mind; they are often more motivated by the plea-\nsure of this activity in itself, than by an actual information\nneed [24]. Emphasis should be placed on such serendipi-\ntous ‚Äòdiscovery‚Äô processes in the context of MIR systems\ndevelopment by supporting various different browsing ap-\nproaches.\nOne such approach is the provision of ‚Äúentry points‚Äù to\nthe catalogue, to aid users navigating through collections of\npotentially unfamiliar music [17]; this allows users to situate\nthemselves, encouraging subsequent browsing and discov-\nery. Audio previewing can be a useful tool in the browsing\nprocess, allowing users to quickly sample a piece of music\nto determine whether further attention is warranted; here,\nMIR systems could usefully identify representative portions\nof the music to sample, for instance by offering a skip-to-\nchorus feature [7].\nOther approaches might make use of visual elements; one\nstudy proposes a shifting collage of CD covers accompa-\nnied by snippets of songs from each album as it is given\nprominence in the collage [8]. Musical content could also\nbe visualized symbolically, by generating map displays that\ntranslate sound or rhythm similarity into visual proximity tobetter support genre browsing [8], or by generating graph-\nics that translate audio similarity into visual similarity more\nexplicitly [21].\n3.4.2 Goal-Directed Search\nAs when browsing, individuals employ different approaches\nto the goal-directed search for new music. Inskip et al.\n(2008) give examples of different strategies employed by\nusers of a folk music library, noting that strategies sig-\nniÔ¨Åcantly vary with research experience of the individual;\nthus, variable search techniques should be supported [17].\nSearching by similarity (to a particular song or artist) is a\npopular feature among MIR system users [36]; Isikhan et al.\n(2010) [20] evaluate a melody similarity metric in a percep-\ntual study, aiming to improve result rankings of MIR sys-\ntems. Another user study evaluates the suitability of sup-\nporting textual queries for melodic content by symbolic en-\ncoding of the sought melodic contour; results indicate that\nsuch queries are too difÔ¨Åcult to be used successfully by or-\ndinary users, and require considerable musical training to\nconstruct [34]. A different approach to textual queries re-\ntrieves musical recommendations based on semantic quali-\nties of music through affective, structural, and kinaesthetic\ndescriptors [27].\nCertain search strategies may be of value for use in spe-\nciÔ¨Åc contexts; for instance, a search function matching video\nfeatures to music features would have potential applications\nin Ô¨Ålm making, advertising, and other domains requiring\nsynchronisation [18]. Casey et al. (2008) provide a far-\nranging overview of other available content-based search\napproaches, outlining different use cases and query types\n[3].\n3.4.3 Recommendations on Metadata\nDescriptive elements, stored as metadata, are used to search,\nÔ¨Ålter, and organize music collections. If the metadata in\na user‚Äôs collection is to remain cohesive and up-to-date as\nnew items are added, simplicity of use is paramount; adding\nvalid metadata to a track should be a task requiring no\nmore than a few clicks [6]. Beyond bibliographic infor-\nmation such as artist, album, and song name, user studies\nfrequently identify the potential value of including lyrics in\nmetadata [1, 6, 7, 18]. Relational information between cat-\nalogue items, such as inter-artist links, should be provided\nto aid the user in his or her selection [22]. While metadata\nshould be accurate, ‚Äòfuzzy‚Äô querying should be supported;\ne.g., date queries should be treated Ô¨Çexibily, allowing re-\ntrieval by decade or more blurry categories such as ‚Äòrecent‚Äô\nand ‚Äòold‚Äô, instead of requiring a year to be speciÔ¨Åed [1].\nBeyond describing musical content, metadata may de-\nscribe context; ‚Äúuse tagging‚Äù can prove valuable to users\nby encoding information on different scenarios in which a\ngiven piece of music might be relevant [6, 17]. Allowing\n337Oral Session 5: User Studies\nusers to provide arbitrary metadata would allow for Ô¨Çexi-\nbility in this regard, and cater to a number of use cases;\nfor instance, attendees might seek to justify the inclusion\nof a song in a party playlist at a social gathering, to the\nparty‚Äôs host [7]. Related to ‚Äúuse tagging‚Äù is the provision\nof user proÔ¨Åles, or ‚Äúmusic personalities‚Äù; these allow a rec-\nommender system to cater to different user contexts and\nmoods [22]. Demographics and musical background, and\nfamiliarity with a particular piece, have been shown to im-\npact on users‚Äô semantic descriptions of music [26], further\nsuggesting the usefulness of distinguishing between differ-\nent categories of users. Chai and Vercoe (2000) propose\nan XML-like mark-up language which would encode such\ncontextual tagging for efÔ¨Åcient sharing and re-use between\ndifferent MIR systems [35].\n3.4.4 Social Aspects\nChanges in musical taste are invariably inÔ¨Çuenced by so-\ncial factors [23]; in one study, 96% of participants discussed\nmusic with their friends [30]. To incorporate social as-\npects, researchers have suggested support for collaborative\nplaylist creation [7] among users in social settings; further\nstudies discuss collaborative browsing and search [8], anno-\ntation [17], and collaborative Ô¨Åltering, taking into account\nboth preferences and dislikes [5].\nBeyond collaborative access of an external catalogue,\nusers enjoy browsing through other users‚Äô music libraries.\nThis allows them to target users with compatible tastes, and\nthus discover new music [30]. Cunningham et al. (2004) [6]\ndiscuss such sharing of personal collections, emphasising\nthe requirement that a collection‚Äôs public appearance must\nbe customisable, e.g., to hide ‚Äòguilty pleasures‚Äô that might\nnegatively affect the image the user wishes to convey of his\nor her musical tastes.\nSocial networking techniques could create trusted recom-\nmendations among users, mirroring the way that trust is built\nup in musical tastes among peers [24]. An online forum\ncould fulÔ¨Åll a similar role, encouraging networking between\nusers [17].\n3.4.5 Organization of Music Information\nA study examining personal music collections reveals orga-\nnization principles based on intended use: people organize\nmusic on the basis of the situation in which they intend to\nlisten to a particular set of music (e.g. ‚Äúwork music‚Äù, ‚Äúdriv-\ning music‚Äù) [6]. The same study calls for functionality en-\nabling links between songs or song collections and online\nresources; furthermore, an archival function is suggested,\nwhich both removes neglected tracks from the standard li-\nbrary, and provides a mechanism to rediscover old music.\nAnother study [7] recommends that media interfaces sup-\nport and seamlessly integrate different Ô¨Åle formats and me-\ndia (e.g., music downloaded to the hard drive, USB sticks,CDs, etc) into a single collection without loss of metadata.\n3.4.6 User Interface Appearance\nMusic playback systems should feature simple, clean inter-\nface designs featuring large, clearly labeled controls. Inter-\nfaces should be attractive and playful, avoiding the clinical\nand ‚Äúsomewhat dark‚Äù appearance of most currently avail-\nable media players [7]. Existing visual representations of\nmusical content, such as ‚Äúlandscape‚Äù representations pro-\nviding a geographic view of a musical collection, have cer-\ntain disadvantages [21]; one solution is a procedural algo-\nrithm to generate icons to be applied to the music Ô¨Åles of\nthe content they represent; this allows visual data mining of\nmusic collections from within the Ô¨Åle listings of a standard\ncomputer operating system.\nSpecial considerations must be taken into account when\ndeveloping interfaces aimed at young users. A compre-\nhensive review of relevant guidelines has been established,\nmaking use of a participatory design panel in order to create\na novel music organizer for children [9].\n3.4.7 User Support\nGraduated access (‚Äútraining wheels‚Äù) can help inexperi-\nenced users to overcome the learning curve of an unfamiliar\nsystem. Online support should be available; in a digital li-\nbrary context, users should be able to contact librarians for\nhelp [17]. Certain metadata such as genre or record label are\nuseless to people lacking the required knowledge to interpret\nthem; thus, supporting descriptions should be provided [22].\nUser studies are useful in shedding light on the ‚Äúinforma-\ntion problem‚Äù of the users of MIR systems, but ultimately,\na cognitive framework will be required to better understand\nthe music seeking behaviour of MIR users [30].\n3.4.8 Hardware/Portable MIR Device\nCunningham et al. (2007) outline plans for a portable MIR\nplatform. This device would be equipped with a microphone\nthat constantly records surrounding sounds, identifying mu-\nsical extracts and saving them for later analysis by audio-\nÔ¨Ångerprinting against a database. Such a device would be\nuseful in tracking down information on music encountered\nserendipitously during everyday activities [4]. This direc-\ntion of research seems especially relevant given the capabil-\nities and increasingly widespread adoption of smartphone\nplatforms [28].\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nUser studies have been identiÔ¨Åed as key components of\nmusic information research. A number of studies have\nbeen conducted in this direction; however, the dominant\nparadigm in the Ô¨Åeld is Ô¨Årmly systems-oriented.\n33812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nWhile the existing work has provided valuable Ô¨Åndings\nand recommendations for future MIR development, ex-\npanded research attention will be required to provide a com-\nprehensive, generalizable picture of music information use.\nFuture research might include the more widespread adop-\ntion of quantitative methods; this would provide a route\ntowards testing the generalisability of developer‚Äôs assump-\ntions and of the initial Ô¨Åndings thus far. Crowd-sourcing\nmethodologies, previously applied to corpus-generation\n[31‚Äì33], provide an intriguing direction for future quantita-\ntive work. Furthermore, a greater emphasis on demographic\ndiversity and cross-sectional research will broaden the ap-\nplicability of future research Ô¨Åndings towards the listening\npublic at large.\nIf the ‚ÄúGrand Challenge‚Äù of the Ô¨Åeld is to provide a fully-\nintegrated system providing all manners of MIR access [13],\na Ô¨Årm focus on user requirements is important; otherwise,\nconvincing listeners to actually use such a system in the real\nworld may prove to be a Grander Challenge Still.\n5.

Monaural source sepa-\nration techniques are combined to simultaneously enhance\nharmonic parts and extract the leading voice. For evalu-\nation the UltraStar database of 581 pop music songs with\n516 distinct singers is chosen. Extensive test runs with Long\nShort-Term Memory sequence classiÔ¨Åcation reveal that bi-\nnary classiÔ¨Åcation of gender, height, race and age reaches\nup to 89.6, 72.1, 63.3 and 57.6 % unweighted accuracy on\nbeat level in unseen test data.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nSinger trait classiÔ¨Åcation, that is, automatically recogniz-\ning meta data such as age and gender of the performing\nvocalist(s) in recorded music, is currently still an under-\nresearched topic in music information retrieval, in contrast\nto the increasing efforts devoted to that area in paralinguistic\nspeech processing. Speaker trait recognition is often used in\ndialog systems to improve service quality [1], yet another\nimportant area of application is forensics where it can de-\nliver cues on the identities of unknown speakers [9]. Like-\nwise, applications in music processing can be found in cate-\ngorization and query of large databases with potentially un-\nknown artists ‚Äì that is, artists for whom not enough reliable\ntraining data is available for building singer identiÔ¨Åcation\nmodels as, e. g., in [12]. Robustly extracting a variety of\nmeta information can then allow the artist to be identiÔ¨Åed\nin a large collection of artist meta data, such as the Inter-\nnet Movie Database (IMDB). In addition, exploiting gender\ninformation is known to be very useful for building models\nfor other music information retrieval tasks such as automatic\nlyrics transcription [11].\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.Current research in speech processing suggests that the\nautomatic determination of age in full realism is challeng-\ning even in clean, spoken language [16]. On the other hand,\nit is well known that age as well as body shape (height and\nweight) have acoustic correlates [4,10] that can be exploited\nfor automatic classiÔ¨Åcation [13]; additionally, it has been\nshown that demographic traits including ethnicity can be de-\nrived from spoken language [6]. In comparison to speech,\nrecognition of singer traits is expected to be an even more\nchallenging task due to pitch variability, inÔ¨Çuence of voice\ntraining, and presence of multiple vocalists as well as instru-\nmental accompaniment. Previous research dealt with gen-\nder identiÔ¨Åcation of unseen artists in recorded popular mu-\nsic [17], which could be performed with over 90 % accuracy\nin full realism by extracting the leading voice through an ex-\ntension of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [3].\nStill, to our knowledge, few, if any, studies exist on\nrecognition of other singer traits in music. Hence, we intro-\nduce three new dimensions to be investigated: age, height\nand race. Our annotation scheme is inspired by the TIMIT\ncorpus commonly used in speech processing, which pro-\nvides rich speaker trait information. As such, we adopt\nthe term ‚Äòrace‚Äô from the corpus‚Äô meta-information‚Äîthough\nmodern biology often neither classiÔ¨Åes the homo sapiens\nsapiens by race nor sub-categories for collective differen-\ntiation in both physical and behavioral traits. While current\nmolecular biologic and population genetic research argues\nthat a systematic categorization may not sufÔ¨Åce the enor-\nmous diversity and Ô¨Çuent differences between geographic\npopulation, it can be argued that when aiming at an end-\nuser information retrieval application, a classiÔ¨Åcation into\nillustrative, archetypal categories is desirable.\nFor evaluation of automatic singer-independent classiÔ¨Å-\ncation, we extended the UltraStar database [15] with de-\ntailed annotation of singer traits (Section 2). Furthermore,\nwe improve extraction of the leading voice by Ô¨Åltering of\ndrum accompaniment (Section 3). The classiÔ¨Åcation by\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (BLSTM-RNN) is brieÔ¨Çy outlined in Section 4.\nComprehensive evaluation results are presented in Section 5\nbefore conclusions are drawn in Section 6.\n37Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\n2. ULTRASTAR SINGER TRAITS DATABASE\nOur experiments build on the UltraStar database proposed\nin [17] for singer-independent evaluation of vocalist gender\nrecognition, containing 581 songs commonly used for the\n‚ÄòUltraStar‚Äô karaoke game, corresponding to over 37 h to-\ntal play time. Note that using highly popular songs is no\ncontradiction to the goal of recognizing unknown artists,\nbut rather a requirement for establishment of solid ground\ntruth. The database is split according to the Ô¨Årst letter of\nthe name of the performer into training (A, D, G, . . . ), de-\nvelopment (B, E, H, . . . ) and test partitions (0-9, C, F, . . . ).\nThe ground truth tempo is provided and lyrics are aligned to\n(quarter) beats. The annotation of the database was substan-\ntially extended beyond gender information: The identity of\nthe singer(s) was determined at beat level wherever possible.\nThis is particularly challenging in case of formations such\nas ‚Äòboy-‚Äô or ‚Äògirl-groups‚Äô, in which case the ‚Äòsinger diariza-\ntion‚Äô (alignment of the singer identity to the music) was de-\ntermined from publicly available music videos. Then, infor-\nmation on gender, height, birth year and race of the 516 dis-\ntinct singers present in the database was collected and multi-\nply veriÔ¨Åed from on-line textual and audiovisual knowledge\nsources, including IMDB, Wikipedia and YouTube. All an-\nnotation was performed by two male experts for popular mu-\nsic (24 and 28 years old).\nIn a multitude of cases, two or more singers are singing\nsimultaneously. In [17], which only dealt with gender recog-\nnition, the case that male and female vocalists are singing in\n‚Äòduet‚Äô was treated as a special case, where the corresponding\nbeats were excluded from further analysis. To extend this\nparadigm to the now multi-dimensional annotation, we de-\nrived the following scheme: For nominal traits (gender and\nrace), the beats were marked as ‚Äòunknown‚Äô unless all simul-\ntaneously present artists share the same attribute value. For\ncontinuous-valued traits (age and height), the average value\nwas calculated, since in formations the individual artists‚Äô\ntraits are usually similar. This procedure was also followed\nto treat performances of formations where an exact singer\ndiarization could not be retrieved, by assuming presence of\nan ‚Äòaverage singer‚Äô throughout. In case that the desired at-\ntribute is missing for at least one of the performing vocalists,\nthe corresponding beats were marked as ‚Äòunknown‚Äô.\nThe distribution of gender and race among the 516\nsingers are shown in Figures 1a and 1b. Age (Figure 1c)\nand height (Figure 1d) are shown as box-and-whisker plots\nwhere boxes range from the Ô¨Årst to the third quartile and\nall values that exceed that range by more than 1.5 times the\nwidth of the box are considered outliers, depicted by cir-\ncles. Unlike gender, height, and race, the age distribution\ncan only be given on beat level since age is not well deÔ¨Åned\nper artist (due to different recording dates) nor per song (due\nto potentially multiple singers per song). The continuous-\nvalued attributes height and age were discretized to ‚Äòshort‚Äô# beats train devel test Œ£\nno voice (0) 90 076 75 741 48 948 214 765\ngender\nfemale (f) 32 308 23 071 9 739 65 118\nmale (m) 55 505 49 497 37 686 142 688\n? 86 253 771 1 110\nrace\nwhite (w) 67 525 62 003 40 479 170 007\nb/h/a 16 378 9 465 7 136 32 979\n? 3 996 1 353 581 5 930\nage\nyoung (y) 48 510 42 056 25 682 116 248\nold (o) 34 074 24 596 18 712 77 382\n? 5 315 6 169 3 802 15 286\nheight\nshort (s) 29 638 24 946 8 562 63 146\ntall (t) 30 177 30 146 23 452 83 775\n? 28 084 17 729 16 182 61 995\nŒ£ 177 975 148 562 97 144 423 681\nTable 1 : Number of beats per trait, class and set (train /\ndevel /test) in the UltraStar singer trait database. ‚Äòb/h/a‚Äô:\nblack / hispanic / asian. ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô (?) includes simultane-\nous performance of artists of different gender / race, as well\nas those with unknown ground truth.\n(s,<175cm) and ‚Äòtall‚Äô (t, ‚â•175cm), respectively ‚Äòyoung‚Äô\n(y,<30years) and ‚Äòold‚Äô (o, ‚â•30years); the thresholds\nare motivated by the medians of the traits (175 cm resp.\n28 years) to avoid sparsity of either class.

The smaller classes ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô, ‚ÄòHispanic‚Äô and\n‚ÄòAsian‚Äô were subsumed due to great sparsity of ‚ÄòHispanic‚Äô\nand ‚ÄòAsian‚Äô singers: Our goal is to evaluate our system on all\ndata for which a ground truth is available. ‚ÄòUnknown‚Äô beats\nare excluded from further analysis. From the manual singer\ndiarization and collection of singer meta data, the beat level\nannotation is generated automatically, resulting in the num-\nber of beats and according classiÔ¨Åcation tasks shown in Ta-\nble 1.

Distribution of\nage is shown on beat level, since it is dependent on recording date.\n3.1 Enhancement of Harmonic Parts\nEnhancement of harmonic parts is performed following\n[17]. It is based on a non-negative factorization of the mag-\nnitude spectrogram obtained by Short-Time Fourier trans-\nform (STFT) that is computed using a multiplicative up-\ndate algorithm for NMF minimizing the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence. We then use a Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nto discriminate between components (spectra and their\ntime-varying gains) corresponding to percussive or non-\npercussive signal parts. The classiÔ¨Åer is trained on a man-\nually labeled set of NMF components extracted from popu-\nlar music as described in [15]. The features for discrimina-\ntion of drum and harmonic components exactly correspond\nto those used in [15]. For straightforward reproducibility\nof our experiments, we used the default parameters of the\npublicly available1drum beat separation demonstrator of\nthe source separation toolkit openBliSSART [18]: frame\nrate 30 ms, window size 60 ms, and 100 iterations. 50 NMF\ncomponents are used; for 20 components thereof, the spec-\ntral shape wis pre-initialized from typical drum spectra de-\nlivered with the openBliSSART demonstrator. To allow the\nalgorithm to use different sets of components for the indi-\nvidual sections of a song, chunking into frame-synchronous\nnon-overlapping chunks is performed as in [17].\n3.2 Leading Voice Separation\nThe second method used to facilitate singer trait identiÔ¨Å-\ncation is the leading voice separation approach described\nin [2, 3]. In this model, the STFT of the observed signal\nat each frame is expressed as the sum of STFTs of vocal and\nbackground music signals. These are estimated by an unsu-\npervised approach: The voice STFT is modelled as product\nof source (periodic glottal pulse) and Ô¨Ålter STFTs while no\n1http://openblissart.github.com/openBliSSARTspeciÔ¨Åc constraints are set for the background music signal\nbecause of its wide possible variability. The estimation of\nthe various model parameters is then conducted by iterative\napproaches based on NMF techniques following a two step\nstrategy. The Ô¨Årst step provides an initial estimate of the pa-\nrameters while the second step is a constrained re-estimation\nstage which reÔ¨Ånes the leading melody estimation and in\nparticular limits sudden octave jumps that may remain after\nthe Ô¨Årst estimation stage. To ensure best reproducibility of\nour results, we used an open-source implementation2of the\nalgorithm with default parameters. Chunking was applied as\nin [17].\n3.3 Combined Source Separation Approaches\nWhen the algorithm described in the last section is applied\nto popular music, it turns out that part of the drum track\nmay remain after separation. Hence, for this study, we con-\nsidered cascading of both separation techniques: harmonic\nenhancement after leading voice separation (LV-HE), and\nvice versa (HE-LV). Thereby time domain signals are syn-\nthesized inbetween the two separation stages, in order to be\nable to use different NMF parameterizations for both algo-\nrithms.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n4.1 Acoustic Features\nThe features exactly correspond to those used in [15] and\nwere extracted for each beat using the open-source toolkit\nopenSMILE [5]. We consider the short-time energy, zero-,\nand mean-crossing rate known to indicate vocal presence. In\naddition we extract values from the normalized autocorrela-\ntion sequence of the DFT coefÔ¨Åcients, namely voicing prob-\nability, F-zero and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). F-zero\n2Software available at http://www.durrieu.ch/phd/software.html\n39Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\nis the location of the highest peak of the autocorrelation se-\nquence aside from the maximum at zero. HNR is computed\nby the value of this peak. Pitch and voice quality parame-\nters have been successfully used in paralinguistic informa-\ntion assessment from speech [16]. We further calculate Mel\nfrequency cepstral coefÔ¨Åcients (MFCC) 0‚Äì12 and their re-\nspective Ô¨Årst-order delta regression coefÔ¨Åcients which are\nknown to capture the characteristic qualities of individual\nvoices for singer identiÔ¨Åcation [12]. Thus, altogether we\nemploy a set of 46 time-varying features. The employed\nconÔ¨Åguration of the openSMILE toolkit is provided for fur-\nther reproducibility at http://www.openaudio.eu.\n4.2 ClassiÔ¨Åcation by BLSTM-RNN\nAs in [17], sequence classiÔ¨Åcation with Bidirectional Long\nShort-Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs) has been observed greatly superior to beat-wise\nstatic classiÔ¨Åcation by SVMs or Hidden Naive Bayes on the\nvocalist gender recognition task (90.77 % beat level accu-\nracy on original signals vs. 72.78 % resp. 76.17 %), we opt\nfor this classiÔ¨Åer for our study. BLSTM-RNNs unite the\nconcept of bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) with Long Short-\nTerm Memory (LSTM) [7]. BRNNs use two separate hid-\nden layers instead of one, both connected to the same input\nand output layers, of which the Ô¨Årst processes the input se-\nquence forwards and the second backwards. The network\ntherefore always has access to the complete past and the fu-\nture context in a symmetrical way. Consequently, it must\nhave the complete input sequence at hand before it can be\nprocessed; however, this is not a restriction in the context of\nour application. In short, the LSTM concept allows the net-\nwork to access potentially unlimited range of context, and\nto learn when to store, use, or discard information acquired\nfrom previous inputs or outputs. This makes (B)LSTM-\nRNNs useful for sequence classiÔ¨Åcation tasks where the re-\nquired amount of context is unknown a priori.\n4.3 BLSTM Topology and Training\nWe trained individual BLSTM networks for each classiÔ¨Å-\ncation task. As in [17], the networks had one hidden layer\nwith 80 LSTM memory cells for each direction. The size\nof the input layer was equal to the number of features (46),\nwhile the size of the output layer was equal to the number\nof classes to discriminate (2‚Äì3). Its output activations were\nrestricted to the interval [0; 1] and their sum was forced to\nunity by normalizing with the softmax function. Thus, the\nnormalized outputs represent the posterior class probabil-\nities. The songs in the test set were presented frame by\nframe (in correct temporal order) to the input layer, and each\nframe was assigned to the class with the highest probability\nas indicated by the output layer. For network training, su-\npervised learning with early stopping was used as follows:We initialized the network weights randomly from a Gaus-\nsian distribution ( ¬µ= 0,œÉ= 0.1). Then, each sequence\n(song) in the UltraStar training set was presented frame by\nframe to the network. To improve generalization, the or-\nder of the input sequences was determined randomly, and\nGaussian noise ( ¬µ= 0,œÉ= 0.3) was added to the input\nactivations. The network weights were iteratively updated\nusing resilient propagation [14]. To prevent over-Ô¨Åtting, the\nperformance (in terms of classiÔ¨Åcation error) on the valida-\ntion set was evaluated after each training iteration (epoch).\nOnce no improvement over 20 epochs had been observed,\nthe training was stopped and the network with the best per-\nformance on the validation set was used as the Ô¨Ånal network.\nAs the race recognition problem is particularly unbalanced,\nslight modiÔ¨Åcations were employed for the training proce-\ndure: A Ô¨Åxed number of 20 epochs was run to avoid over-\nÔ¨Åtting to the validation set, and the standard deviation of\nthe Gaussian noise on the input activations was increased to\nœÉ= 0.9.\n5. RESULTS\nOur primary measure for evaluating performance of au-\ntomatic singer trait recognition is unweighted accuracy\n(UA)‚Äîi. e., the average recall of the classes‚Äîon beat level.\nDue to class imbalance (Table 1) it represents the discrim-\nination power of the classiÔ¨Åer more closely than ‚Äòconven-\ntional‚Äô weighted accuracy (WA) where recalls of the classes\nare weighted with their a-priori probabilities. Note that both,\nrandom guessing or always picking the majority class would\nachieve a UA of 33.33 % in ternary and 50.00 % in binary\nclassiÔ¨Åcation tasks.\n5.1 Results on Beat Level\nIn order to highlight the difÔ¨Åculty of the evaluated singer\ntrait recognition tasks in full realism, we Ô¨Årst evaluated the\nBLSTM-RNN on the task to recognize the presence of a\nsinger. It turns out that this can be done with over 75 %\nUA when using the leading voice extraction ‚Äì note that this\nalgorithm usually extracts the leading instrument when no\nvoice is present, hence the task remains non-trivial. Best re-\nsults on the 2-class gender recognition task are obtained by\nthe proposed combination of source separation algorithms\n(LV-HE, 89.61 % UA) while in the 3-class task, best UA is\nachieved by the LV algorithm alone (69.29 % UA). Notably,\nthis is higher than it would be expected if accuraries of voice\nactivity and 2-class gender recognition were independent. 2-\nclass recognition of race delivers up to 63.30 % UA when\nincluding HE preprocessing, while LV alone downgrades\nperformance compared to the original. Furthermore, we ob-\nserve that height recognition can be robustly performed at\nup to 72.07 % UA when using HE-LV preprocessing, which\nboosts the UA by over 7 % absolute compared to no pre-\n4012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nPreprocessing\n[%] ‚Äì HE LV LV-HE HE-LV\ntask classes UA WA UA WA UA WA UA WA UA WA\nvoice 0/1 74.55 74.50 73.82 73.84 75.77 75.81 75.40 75.41 75.09 75.11\ngender 0/m/f 63.75 68.54 65.65 68.91 69.29 71.31 67.90 70.41 68.52 70.44\nm/f 86.67 91.09 88.45 91.91 86.93 91.12 89.61 93.60 87.76 92.50\nrace 0/w/b+h+a 48.17 63.84 47.46 63.02 49.37 65.46 49.23 63.63 48.40 63.77\nw/b+h+a 60.44 65.82 63.30 76.98 55.05 76.18 62.57 78.67 62.78 75.16\nage 0/y/o 51.02 57.61 50.00 57.14 53.50 59.85 51.26 58.86 50.01 57.72\ny/o 55.30 55.60 57.55 56.56 53.93 53.63 55.97 54.89 54.69 54.17\nheight 0/s/t 53.94 66.79 52.35 66.57 58.15 69.30 57.67 68.41 58.91 69.53\ns/t 64.70 72.73 62.31 70.67 66.54 73.00 69.65 77.49 72.07 78.26\nTable 2 : Beat-wise BLSTM-RNN classiÔ¨Åcation of UltraStar test set on 2- and 3-class tasks.

Note that such measurements are more\nheuristic in nature, since a song level ground truth cannot\nalways be established due to typical phenomena in real-life\nmusic such as alternating male / female vocalists. To brieÔ¨Çy\ncomment on the results, song level gender can be recognized\nwith up to 91.3 % UA, race with 64.4 % UA and age with\n58.9 % UA. For gender, estimation from the vote on all(not\nonly voiced) beats seems to be even more robust than votes\non the 2-class beat level task. LV-HE preprocessing delivers\noverall best results.5.3 Discussion and Outlook\nForrace, an interdependency with genre could be assumed;\nhowever, the fact that source separation generally improves\nthe result over the original music suggests that genre is not\nthe primary information learned by the classiÔ¨Åer. Further-\nmore, genres typically associated with non-white singers\nsuch as hip hop are very sparsely represented in the Ul-\ntraStar database, which is originally intended for karaoke\napplications. Still, the very robust recognition of height is\nclearly correlated with robust gender identiÔ¨Åcation, as tall\nfemale singers are sparse in the considered data set.\nCompared to ‚Äòusual‚Äô results obtained on spoken lan-\nguage, accuracies of agerecognition are rather low; the task\nseems to be especially challenging on the considered type of\n‚Äòchart‚Äô popular music with a prevalence of singers in their\ntwenties. At least, when using gender-dependent models for\nage, 61.63 % UA could be achieved for males; for females\nthere is not enough training data.\nA promising direction for further research may be to in-\nvestigate different units of analysis, such as longer-term sta-\ntistical functionals that are commonly used in paralinguistic\ninformation retrieval from speech [16], instead of recogni-\n41Oral Session 1: Melody and Singing\ntion at the beat level. Still, this is not fully straightforward\ndue to the feature variation, especially for pitch, which will\nnecessitate methods for robust pitch estimation and transfor-\nmation.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nInspired by previous successful studies on vocalist gender\nrecognition, we introduced fully automatic assessment of\nnew paralinguistic traits (age, height and race) in a large col-\nlection of recorded popular music. While we could also im-\nprove gender recognition close to perfection even on beat\nlevel (up to 93.60 % WA on unseen test data), foremost\nwe have shown feasibility of race and height classiÔ¨Åcation\nin full realism. Even in chart music with a prevalence of\nsingers from 20‚Äì30 years, age recognition could be per-\nformed signiÔ¨Åcantly above chance level; still, when aiming\nat real-life applications new directions in research must be\ntaken.\nFuture work should primarily focus on more variation in\ndata (particularly concerning age and race) by not only in-\ncluding chart music, but also jazz and non-Western music.\nFurthermore, we will investigate multi-task learning to ex-\nploit singer trait interdependencies in learning.\n7.

Adapting a generic model to user rat-\nings is useful for personalisation and can help to better un-\nderstand such differences. This paper presents an approach\nto use machine learning techniques for analysing user data\nthat speciÔ¨Åes song similarity. We explore the potential for\nlearning generalisable similarity measures with two state-\nof-the-art algorithms for learning metrics. We use the audio\nclips and user ratings in the MagnaTagATune dataset, en-\nriched with genre annotations from the Magnatune label.\n1. MOTIVATION\nIn the recent years, increased efforts have been made to\nadapt MIR techniques, especially for music recommenda-\ntion, to speciÔ¨Åc contexts or user groups. This is encouraged\nby developments in machine learning that make more algo-\nrithms applicable to accumulated user data, like user pref-\nerences or click-trough data for ranked search results, and\nenable the involvement of crowd wisdom into general clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation and distance learning tasks. Moreover, the combi-\nnation of different information sources has been proven suc-\ncessful for improving music recommendation and for clas-\nsiÔ¨Åcation into cultural categories such as musical genres.\nThis paper shows the results of some experiments on learn-\ning a musical distance metric from user similarity compar-\nisons. Similarity models of mixed acoustic and tag features\nare trained using comparative user judgent data on song sim-\nilarities. We derive information of the form ‚ÄùSong A is more\nsimilar to Song B than to Song C‚Äù, represented by binary\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.rankings, which allows for the application of more generic\nalgorithms designed for learning from such data.\nAlthough the above type of rating data is not as readily\naccessible as customer preference or social network data, it\nprovides a valuable change of focus from general classiÔ¨Åca-\ntion and recommendation success towards modelling musi-\ncal similarity and the users‚Äô perception of it when engaged\nin a comparison task. Thus, instead of targeting a general\nrelevance criterion, the optimisation task tackled in the fol-\nlowing experiments addresses reported perceived similarity,\nwhich only constitutes one of the many variable aspects of\nrelevance. As distance measures we use Mahalanobis dis-\ntance metrics, which allow for a direct analysis as well as\nthe easy comparison of learning results [5], and therefore\nencourage evaluation from a musicological perspective.\n2. RELATED WORK\nThe distance metrics learning in this paper can be seen as\nan extension of feature selection techniques developed ear-\nlier in the MIR Ô¨Åeld, regarding feature selection as a binary\nweighting of features. E.g., Dash and Liu [4] assembled a\ncomprehensive survey of general techniques for feature se-\nlection in classiÔ¨Åcation tasks. They pointed out attributes\nrelevant for diverse application scenarios, e.g. compabil-\nity considering dataset size, number of classes or robustness\nagainst noise. These attributes enable a systematic compar-\nison of the various approaches when given the parameters\nof a speciÔ¨Åc application. Pickens [13] categorised selection\ntechniques for music retrieval using symbolic data, calling\nfor special attention to features‚Äô musicological properties.\nA set-based method for learning a feature weightings was\napplied by Allan et al. [1]. Users could specify their per-\nceived similarity using two example song sets: one contain-\ning similar and one dissimilar songs. A detailed discussion\non how to generate a successful stimulus partitioning for\na survey involving comparison within triplets of clips sup-\nported the design of their Balanced Complete Block Parti-\ntioning.\n73Poster Session 1\n2.1 Optimising Recommendation via Metadata and\nUser Information\nOut of the many data sources available for music descrip-\ntion, genre annotations provide particularly valuable data for\nindexing and presenting music in recommendation settings.\nMusical genre has been used for the general evaluation of\nsimilarity measures, using the correlation of songs‚Äô genres\nand data clusters derived from the learned similarity [11,12].\nBarrington et al. showed a training of linear combina-\ntions of SVM kernels relating to similarity measurements on\nacoustic, tagging and web-mined annotation data, for build-\ning classiÔ¨Åers for automatic annotation [3]. They also pro-\nvide relevance levels of the different feature types for differ-\nent tag classiÔ¨Åers.\nA user-data based similarity measure for multimedia ob-\njects was introduced by Slaney [15]. Here, similarity of ob-\njects was based on users votings for them. Songs which fea-\nture the same grade of likeability by the same group of users\nwere considered similar. The resulting similarity measure\nwas evaluated via analysing artist consistency in rankings.\nInferring similarity from similar metadata sources as well as\nmusic blog titles, Slaney et al. evaluated the performance of\nseveral methods for learning a Mahalanobis distance met-\nric for music in [16]. McFee et al. [10] used the MLR al-\ngorithm (see below) for parametrising a content-based mu-\nsic similarity metric. A Mahalanobis metric was trained on\ncollected crowd data in form of rankings. This approach is\nvery similar to ours, but their emphasis has been on the need\nfor reliable content-based classiÔ¨Åers for music discovery in\nsparsely annotated data.\nBade et al. [2] train a set of song-adaptive music similar-\nity msasures for folksongs, inferring training data from ex-\npert classiÔ¨Åcations: Several known similarity measures for\nthe symboloc music data and metadata are combined lin-\nearly via a weighted sum speciÔ¨Åc to the measured songs,\nits corresponding clusters or database. For optimisation,\nthe expert classiÔ¨Åcation information is transferred into rela-\ntive distance statements enforcing the class members to be\nnearer than songs from foreign classes.\n2.2 Metric Learning from Comparative Ratings\nMany common algorithms for metric learning use class an-\nnotations and nearest neighbour classiÔ¨Åcations for optimis-\ning and evaluating metrics [18]. As we intend to learn music\nsimilarity from relative comparisons, such approaches are\ndifÔ¨Åcult to apply considering the missing ground truth data\nfor clusters of perceptually similar music pieces or equiva-\nlents.\nBased on a framework for Support Vector Machines,\nSchultz and Joachims [14] presented an optimisation using\nrelative constraints we apply on the task of music similarity\nlearning. Davis et al. formulated a metric learning prob-lem as an LogDet optimisation task [5]. In this case, a\nfully parametrised Mahalanobis metric was learned, allow-\ning for a regularisation towards another predeÔ¨Åned Maha-\nlanobis metric.\nMcFee et al. have designed an algorithm for learning a\nMahalanobis metric to rankings (MLR) [9]. In our experi-\nments, MLR is applied to learning a distance metric on mu-\nsic, using the implementation provided by the authors. In\ntheir publication mentioned above [10], this algorithm has\nbeen adapted to enable learning from collaborative Ô¨Åltering\ndata.\n3. THE MAGNATAGATUNE DATABASE\nThe MagnaTagATune database combines the results of a\nweb-based game called ‚ÄùTagATune‚Äù together with the mu-\nsic clips used therein and extracted audio features [7]. These\nroughly 30-second long clips are provided by the Magnatune\nonline music label on a creative commons license. Mag-\nnatune has labelled the clips in this database with 44 genre-\ntags, which are not mutually exclusive. The majority of the\ndata can be divided into four disjoint main groups using the\ngenre tags ‚Äùclassical‚Äù, ‚Äùelectronica‚Äù, ‚Äùworld‚Äù and ‚Äùrock‚Äù,\neach containing more than 17% of the total number of clips.\nThe MagnaTagATune game is a collaborative online game\nwith two modes: a regular mode for collecting tags and a\nbonus mode for collecting similarity ratings.\n3.1 Captured Similarity Ratings\nWe extract relative similarity information from data collected\nduring the ‚Äùbonus‚Äù mode of the ‚ÄùTagATune‚Äù game. In that\nmode, two players earn points if they vote the same clip as\nthe outlier out of three clips provided [8]. All votes made\n(matching or not) are saved into a histogram hi={ha,hb,hc}\n‚ààHfor that triplet of songs. 533 such histograms are in-\ncluded in the MagnaTagATune database, describing the vote\ndistribution (between 1 and 153 votes per triplet, 14 on av-\nerage). Not counting permutations of triplets, there are 346\nunique triplets comprising 1019 unique clips. Many his-\ntograms do not show a clear agreement on one outlier. This\nmay be caused by the diverse nature of the clips, causing\ntriplets normally to range over various genres, as discussed\nin [11]. However, many other variables like users‚Äô cultural\nbackgrounds can equally affect their decisions. Content is\nhomogeneously distributed throughout the complete 25863-\nclip database, but the small number of triplets available and\nthe varying number of permutations do not allow for choos-\ning a suitable subset featuring a Balanced Block Partition-\ning. This has been pointet out as important in [1] to obtain a\nrelatively unbiased survey data set.\nThe above data was transferred into a ranking represen-\ntation like in [9]. Treating the histograms as votings on the\nsimilarity between the outlier and the other clips, for each\n7412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nclipCa, a setrs\naof similar and, respectively, dissimilar clips\nrd\nawas calculated.\nrs\na={b|‚àÉhi‚ààH:ha<hc‚àßhb<hc} (1)\nrd\na={c|‚àÉhi‚ààH:ha<hc‚àßhb<hc} (2)\nThe complete set of derived rankings is then given by\nO=/braceleftBig\n(rs\na,rd\na)|‚àÉCa‚àßrs\na,rd\na/negationslash=‚àÖ‚àßrd\na‚à©rs\na=‚àÖ/bracerightBig\n.(3)\nInconsistent rankings with rd\na‚à©rs\na/negationslash=‚àÖwere excluded to\nenable the following training process. In order to use the\ndata with other algorithms, we removed further triplets1.\nAll but 12 of the resuting rankings contain a single clip on\neach side:|rd\na|=|rs\na|= 1. This resulted in 533 rankings.\n3.2 Feature Generation\nThe MagnaTagATune dataset comes with precalculated fea-\ntures for all clips extracted by the ‚ÄùThe Echo Nest‚Äù API\n1.0, via the ‚Äùanalyse‚Äù interface. These features are also in-\ncluded in other online databases such as the Million Song\nDataset2. This also allows for a wider application of the\nfeature extraction procedure detailed below and facilitates\ncomparability with other studies. Of the wide feature range\nprovided3, we only use the chroma and timbre informa-\ntion. The chroma and timbre features are sampled on a non-\nuniform time scale. In order to aggregate to the clip level,\nwe use a k-means based algorithm to extract n= 4 cluster\ncentres for both of these features. In order to keep the fea-\ntures invariant to key, whilst preserving the harmonic and\nstructural information, the chroma features are then trans-\nposed to Ô¨Åt the main key as estimated in the provided fea-\ntures, in the Ô¨Årst chroma bin. This is achieved using a cir-\ncular shift on the nchroma mean vectors. The resulting\nshifted chroma mean vectors are now separately normalised\nto a maximum value of 1.\nThe timbre features provided within the dataset very much\nresemble the output of a 2-dimensional convolution with\n12 different Ô¨Ålters, corresponding to characteristic spectral\nshapes. After clustering the timbre data to n= 4mean vec-\ntors, these are scaled and clipped to retain 85% of the data\nwithin the interval of [0, 1] for the set of the 1019 clips.\nAdditionally, the cluster weights for each of the included\nchroma and timbre cluster centroids are included in the fea-\ntures.\n3.2.1 Genre Features\nThese acoustic features are enriched using the genre tags as-\nsigned by the Magnatune label. This way, up to four genre\n1Two histograms{ha, hb, hc}and{ha, hb, hd}were removed if they\ndid not agree on the outlier, except if the outliers were candd.\n2http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/\n3http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/ static/AnalyzeDocumentation 2.2.pdftags are assigned to each of the clips. For each clip, a binary\n44-dimensional vector indicates the annotation according to\nthe tags found for all of the clips in the dataset. The combi-\nnation results in one feature vector xi‚àà(R‚à©[0,1])148per\nclipCi,i‚àà{1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,1019}.\n4. LEARNING SIMILARITY FROM\nCOMPARISONS\nThe distance measure d(xi,xj)we intend to optimise using\nthe following algorithms is deÔ¨Åned on the clip level. Gen-\nerally, our approach and the corresponding features are in-\ntended to model a perceived distance, assumed to resemble\nthe inverse similarity of two songs.\nThe ranking data in the following experiments has been\napproximated as a consensus from decisive triplet histograms,\nand is therefore simpler, e.g. contains fewer contradictory\nelements than the original data. Concerning the gathering of\nthe histograms themselves, the authors of [1] emphasise that\nboth the representation and especially the selection of com-\nbinations of the rated stimuli, in this case the clips, presented\nto the users, affect the balance of the resulting ratings. They\nonly accept a set containing all possible triplet combinations\nof a set of stimuli for an unbiased test. Unfortunately, the\ntriplets contained in the MagnaTagATune comparison data\nand the resulting ratings riare unbalanced. This may well\ninclude a bias caused by the speciÔ¨Åc constellation of graph-\nical and acoustical presentations.\nUsing a metric for modelling song similarity implies sev-\neral assumptions. These assumptions have already been ques-\ntioned by Tversky [17], arguing that perceived similarity\nis not necessarily a linear, positive deÔ¨Ånite and symmet-\nric function, which satisÔ¨Åes the triangle inequality. Instead,\nperceived similarity, in many circumstances, is assumed be\ndirectional, considering speciÔ¨Åc functions of the objects in\ncomparison, e.g. prototype and referent.\nHowever, the properties of a metric support efÔ¨Åcient and\nrobust learning algorithms for dealing with the highly sparse\nand often contradictory data involved in learning the song\nsimilarity. Also, metrics have a straightforward geomet-\nric interpretation. Thus, besides the comparison of songs,\nframeworks are available for comparing the metrics them-\nselves. We now give a quick overview of the family of met-\nrics used in our experiments before we focus on the way\nthey are used in Section 5.\n4.1 Mahalanobis distances\nThe two algorithms summarised below are designed to learn\nparametrised distance functions. These functions are special\ncases of Mahalanobis distances, which are deÔ¨Åned as\ndW(xi,xj) =/radicalBig\n(xi‚àíxj)TW(xi‚àíxj), (4)\n75Poster Session 1\nwherexi,xj‚ààRNandW‚ààRN√óN.\nTo qualify as a metric, Whas to be positive deÔ¨Ånite\n[19]. The algorithms we use only guarantee Wto be posi-\ntive semideÔ¨Ånite. The corresponding distance functions still\nsatisfy the conditions of symmetry, non-negativity and the\ntriangle inequality, but allow for dW(xi,xj) = 0 whilst\nxi/negationslash=xjand therefore are called pseudometrics. This func-\ntion is the Euclidean metric if Wis the unit matrix. As\ndetailed below, a Mahalanobis distance can be described as\na weighted Euclidean distance applied to previously linearly\ntransformed features.\n4.2 SC03\nIn [14], Matthew Schultz and Thorsten Joachims present an\nSVM approach to learning a distance metric. The function\nlearned here is parametrised by two matrices, a linear trans-\nformationAand the positive semideÔ¨Ånite W. For our exper-\niments,A=Icontains the identity transformation and W\nis constrained to be a diagonal matrix. Thus dWdescribes a\nweighted Euclidean distance metric.\nIn order to use the users‚Äô similarity data rd\niandrs\ni, the\nrankings are converted into singular similarity statements of\nthe form (a,b,c), where the clip Cais more similar to Cbthan\ntoCc. This leads to the following set of triplet constraints:\nQ=/braceleftBig\n(a,b,c )|‚àÉ(rs\na,rd\na)‚ààO:b‚ààrs\na‚àßc‚ààrd\na/bracerightBig\n(5)\nFor each training triplet (a,b,c ), Schultz et al. consider\nthe squared pointwise difference ‚àÜxi,xjof the transformed\nclips‚Äô features, which in this application case reduces to\n‚àÜxi,xj= (xi‚àíxj)¬∑(xi‚àíxj)(note the point-wise product).\nThe weighted differences of\n‚àÜ‚àÜ\n(a,b,c)= (‚àÜxa,xc‚àí‚àÜxa,xb) (6)\nare then used as constraints for the following optimisation\nproblem (with w=diag(W)):\nmin\nw,Œæ1\n2wTw+cSC03¬∑/summationdisplay\nabcŒæabc (7)\ns.t.‚àÄ(a,b,c )‚ààQtrain :wT‚àÜ‚àÜ\n(a,b,c)‚â•1‚àíŒæabc\nwi,j‚â•0, Œæabc‚â•0.\nThis minimises the loss deÔ¨Åned by the sum of the slack\nvariablesŒæabc, whilst regularising Wusing the Frobenius\nnorm with1\n2/bardblW/bardbl2\nF.

Presenting an algorithm based\non Structural SVM, they compute Wwhilst assuring the\nmargin between the given training rankings and possible dif-\nferent rankings of the training data [10]. This method uses\nbinary rankings and evaluates results by the relative posi-\ntioning of clips marked as relevant or irrelevant. A fully cor-\nrect ranking positions the relevant clips rs\nabefore the ones\ninrd\na. The calculation of the associated loss involves stan-\ndard IR measures for estimating the ranking loss, e.g. the\narea under ROC curve. For selecting the most effective con-\nstraints, a cutting-planes method [6] is used. Note that clips\nnot named in the rankings stay neutral and have no effect on\nthe loss.\nThe MATLAB R/circlecopyrtimplementation of the MLR framework,\navailable online5, provides several options for choosing the\ncutting-planes method and loss function. In the experiments\nbelow, we selected the AUC-related methods for simplicity.\nIn the literature, Wis regularised by its trace tr(W), but\nthe implementation provided by McFee also allows to use a\nsquared Frobenius norm, similar to the quadratic regularisa-\ntion in (7).\n5. EXPERIMENTS\nAll experiments were performed using Ô¨Åve-fold cross-vali-\ndation on the rankings. The ranking set Owas divided into\nÔ¨Åve disjoint batches of 106 or 107 rankings, respectively.\nEach batch was used once as a test set against the remaining\nfour batches combined as training set. For smaller sized\ntraining sets, subsets were picked randomly from each of the\ntraining batches. The size of the test sets was kept constant\nfor all training set sizes.\nWe tested three different variations of learning metrics:\nSC03 for learning a weighted Euclidean distance, MLR for\ncalculating a full Mahalanobis matrix, and MLR with W\nconstrained to be diagonal. The slack-loss / regularisation\ntrade-off factors cwere set to cmlr= 10000 for both the\ndiagonal and the full- WMLR, andcSC03= 100 for the\nSC03 algorithm (Section 4.2). The squared Frobenius norm\nwas used for regularising Win all experiments. These pa-\nrameters were determined in earlier experiments using the\npresent dataset with non-reduced training sets.\nFor evaluation, we compare the rankings in the ground\ntruth with rankings induced by the learned distance func-\ntions. We also tested an unweighted Euclidean distance met-\nric as a baseline. As we deal with binary rankings as de-\nscribed in Section 3.1, any ranking featuring the clips in rs\na\nbefore the ones in rd\nafor a query clip aqualiÔ¨Åes as correct,\n5http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/Àúbmcfee/code/mlr/\n7612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nthe absolute ranking positions were not taken into account.\n5.1 Results\nFigure 1 shows the results for running the above conÔ¨Ågu-\nration on the features described in Section 3.2. The upper\nplot (a) shows the percentage of correctly induced rankings\nfor the three metric learning approaches as well as the re-\nsults for an unmodiÔ¨Åed Euclidean metric, serving as base-\nline. With 81.81% correctly reproduced test rankings and a\nstandard deviation of 4.78% over the Ô¨Åve test sets, the fully\nparametrised MLR-trained distance produces the best re-\nsults, followed by the diagonal-MLR (71.85%, 2.69%) and\nSC03 (69.61%, 4.27%), barely superceeding the baseline of\n67.74%. Both of the diagonal- Wmethods score rather low\ncompared to the MLR-trained metric. Although the number\nof variables to determine is rather high, given the feature\ndimensionality, MLR proves successful in Ô¨Ånding the best\nsolution, except for the training with less than 50 rankings.\n(a)\n0 100 200 300 4006065707580% test cnstr. satisfied\n(b)\n0 100 200 300 4008090100% train cnstr. sat.\nnumber of training constraints\nFigure 1 .

The fact that the more Ô¨Çexible fully parametrised\nMLR-trained distance metric shows more Ô¨Çexibility towards\nthe satisfaction of training constraints appears intuitive\n(Figure 1(b)).

Results for increasing training set size using PCA\nfeatures. Labels are as above.\n5.1.1 PCA features\nFigure 2 shows the results of applying the metric learning to\na feature set that was reduced to 20 dimensions using Prin-\ncipal Component Analysis (PCA). As in the earlier experi-\nment, MLR scores best, with (76.94%, 3.1%). The degrada-\ntion may be attributed to the smaller number of parameters\n(W‚ààR20√ó20) available for adapting the metric. However,\nwhen analysing the weights for the single feature dimen-\nsions, the ordering (by absolute value of the eigenvalues)\nused for determining the relevant pca dimensions does not\ncorrespond to their inÔ¨Çuence on the rated similarity. Thus,\ninformation relevant for similarity is lost in these PCA re-\nduced features, which has been validated by the training of\nmetrics using more PCA coefÔ¨Åcients. In this experiment\nwith 20 coefÔ¨Åcients we compare the ranking of PCA coefÔ¨Å-\ncients, as determined by PCA data variance, with the rank-\ning of PCA coefÔ¨Åcients derived from the SC03 weighting.\nThey differ on average by more than 52% of the index range.\nWith the PCA features, the SC03 algorithm greatly im-\nproves in performance, 75.42% indicating a higher suitabil-\nity of the low-dimensional vector space. This time, a less\neffective enforcement of training constraints apparently en-\nables a better generalisation. In contrast, the diagonal MLR\nis less able to cope with the data. Especially for the train-\ning sets involving around 300 rankings, the decrease in per-\nformance on the test set can be explained by less consis-\ntent training sets leading to badly generalising metrics. The\nbaseline Euclidean metric achieves 66.97% of correct rat-\nings.\n77Poster Session 1\n6. DISCUSSION\nIn the present paper, we apply general algorithms for met-\nric learning to a music similarity modelling task Using sim-\nple and widely available features and comparative similar-\nity ratings, we demonstrated that a considerable proportion\nof the ratings can be effectively learned and reproduced us-\ning Mahalanobis distances. This corroborates the initial hy-\npothesis that the ratings sharing some concordant informa-\ntion. Whilst with both the original features and the low-\ndimensional PCA features the MLR algorithm shows supe-\nrior results, the diagonal matrix algorithms show compara-\nble generalisation abilities for the PCA features. However,\nPCA seems not suitable for reducing feature dimensionality\nin a musical similarity context. Instead, the metric leaning\ntechniques may hint on the necessary transformations and\non which features may be ommitted.\n6.1 Future Work\nDespite the sparse and sometimes contradictory nature of\nthe rankings derived from MagnaTagATune, we Ô¨Ånd the our\nresults encouraging to develop more elaborate data sets for\nfurther experiments. Special attention will be given to the\nvariation of learned metrics when observing different cul-\nturally deÔ¨Åned user groups. More research has to be done in\nthe development of specialised regularisation terms for met-\nric learning algorithms, e.g. allowing for a customised W\nas a regularisation target [5].\n6.2 Acknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Brian McFee and Thorsten Joachims\nfor their help with using their implementations.\n7.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nTempo and beat are two essential elements in music.  Such  \ninformation is useful  in several applications such as query \nby tempo  (querying a large database based on tempo) , beat \nslicing [17] (segmentation into bas ic music units separated \nby beats ), and beat synchronous mixing . However, \nautomatic beat tracking  and tempo estimation are still \nchallenging tasks when  the music has  time-varying tempo s.  \nConventional  beat tracking schemes  [1] rely on certain \nassumptions about  music contents such as stable  tempo over \ntime, periodical percussions /onsets, and four beats per \nmeasure.  Under  these assumptions , most approaches of beat \ntracking are accomplished by two phases. In the first phase, \nthe onset  strength of music  along time , called novelty curve,  \nis esti mated to indicate the possible positions of note onsets . \nIn the second phase, the quasi -periodic patter ns in novelty \ncurve are analyzed to discover the possible tempo value and the corresponding beat positions . Here, tempo is assumed to \nbe stable  throughout the whole piece of music .  \nHowever,  the above -mentioned assumptions do not hold \ntrue universally, especially for music of classical and jazz. \nMusic of these genre s often has  significant tempo variations , \nmaking it difficult to detect the periodical patterns. In order \nto detect  the variations in tempo,  Frequency Mapped Auto-\nCorrela tion Function (FM-ACF) and S hort-Time Fourier \nTransform  (STFT)  [2] are frequently used to derive a time -\nfrequency representation of the novelty curve , called \ntempogram  [3]. The tempo information is embedded in \ntempogram. We can then apply dynamic programming (DP) \nto the tempogram to deriv e the  so-called tempo curve, which \nrepresents  the most likely  tempo at each time frame.  \nA number of  beat tracking algorithms have been \nproposed in the literature under different methodologies, \nincluding beat-template  training [2], neural network s [4], an \nagent -based method  [5], and so on . Among them , DP is still \nconsidered an efficient and effective  way for  determining \nbeat positions . The use of DP  for beat tracking  has been \nproposed in [1] with good performance, but it is based on a \npre-estimated stable  tempo  which is estimated by time -\ndomain autocorrelation with window weighting . \nThere are several important previous studies that \nattempted to deal with time -varying tempo s. Klapuri et al.  \n[18] used the bandwise time -frequency method to obtain  \naccentuation information, then use d comb filter resonator s \nand probabilistic  models to estimate pulse  width and phase \nof different metrical  level s, including tatum, tactus, and \nmeasure. Davi es and Plumbley  [19] proposed the  use of \ncomplex spectral difference onset function [15] to obtain \nmiddle level representation. Their  algorithm employs  two-\nstate switching model , including general state and context -\ndependent state, to obtain  final b eat positions.  Groshe and \nMuller  [16] used the novelty curve to generate predominant  \nlocal pulse  (PLP) for estimating time -varying tempos.  \nIn this study, we follow the three -phase framework [ 2, 6] \nof beat tracking and attempt  to remove the stable -tempo \nrestriction  by develop ing a two-fold DP approach  for robust \nbeat tracking with  time-varying tempos.  To this en d, the \nfirst DP estimates the time -varying tempo curve from the \ntempogram (which is  obtained from the novelty curve ). \nThen the second DP uses the time -varying tempo  curve to \nidentify the optimum beat positions on the novelty curve.   \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and th at copies \nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n191Poster Session 2\n(In fact, we have proposed similar concepts for speech \nanalysis, including DP -based robust pitch determination [13] \nfor Mandarin tone recognition, and DP -based pitch marking \n[14] for TD -PSOLA  synthesis .) In addition, we also propose \npartial- FFT-based tempo curve estimation and peak picking \nin tempogram  for DP, which enhance the overall efficiency \nwith almost no accuracy  loss.

Flowchart  of the proposed beat tracking system  \n \nThe first block compute s the  novelty curve based on [1 , 6]. \nThe second block generates  the tempogram and estimates \nthe tempo curve from the novelty curve. In the third block, \nbeat positions are estimated by using the information from \nprevious two blocks. Details of each block will be explained \nin the following subsections.  \n 2.1 Novelty Curve Estimation  \n \nFigure  2 shows typical  outputs of various steps in \nnovelty curve estimation. A  power  spectrogram  is first \nobtained by applying STFT to  the source audio with a frame \nsize 31.6 milliseconds and 87.5% overlap. The frequency \ncomponents of spectrogram are then mapped into Mel -scale \nin Figure  2(a) for conforming to the characteristics of \nhuman perception  [1]. Then we apply spectral flux (S PF) \n[12] to obtain the raw novelty curve, as shown in Figure  2 (b)  \nTo be more specific, we have 40 bands in t he Mel -scale \nspectrogram , where each band has a n equal width in the \nMel-scale frequency. In other words, each frame is \ntransformed into a vector of 40 elements of mean energy \nwithin the bands. Moreover, the Mel -scale  spectral flux  can \nbe defined as follows:  \n  \n ùëÄùëíùëôùêπùëôùë¢ùë• (ùë°ùëñ)=1\nùëÅ‚àëùêªùëÖùêπÔøΩùëÄùëíùëôùëÜùëùùëíùëêùë°ùëüùëú ÔøΩùë°ùëñ+1,ùëèùëóÔøΩ‚àíùëÅ\nùëó=1\n                                                          ùëÄùëíùëôùëÜùëùùëíùëêùë°ùëüùëú ÔøΩùë°ùëñ,ùëèùëóÔøΩÔøΩ      (1) \n \n wher eùë°ùëñ is the time for frame i , ùëèùëó is Mel -band  j,  \nùëÄùëíùëôùëÜùëùùëíùëêùë°ùëüùëú ÔøΩùë°ùëñ,ùëèùëóÔøΩ is the Mel spectrogram at frame i  and \nMel-band   j, and  ùêªùëÖùêπ ÔøΩÔºéÔøΩ is the  half-wave rectifier.  \n \n \nIn general, we neglect the locally periodical information \nabove 500 BPM (beats per minute) due to the limitation of \nhuman perception [7]. Thus we use Gaussian smoothing \n(which acts as a low -pass filter) to filter out the redun dant \nhigh-frequency parts in raw novelty curve, as shown in \nFigure  2 (c). The Gaussian filter has a cutoff frequency \nequal to the sampling frequency divided by 5 . At last, we \nsubtract the local mean ( dotted curve in Figure  2 (c) ) to \nobtain the final novelt y curve, as shown in Figure  2 (d).  The \nlocal mean is derived from Gaussian smoothed raw novelty curve  filtered by another Gaussian filter with a cutoff \nfrequency equal to the sampling frequency divided by 125.  \n \n2.2 Tempo Curve Estimation  \n \nIn this block, we estimate the tempo curve by analy zing \nlocally periodical patterns in novelty curve. Generally speaking, local periodicity estimation is usually \naccomplished by STFT, FM- ACF or a combined method [2]. \nHowever, the autocorrelation -based meth od generates  non-\nuniform tempo grid s in tempogram,  since  the temp o is the \ninverse of the beat time difference. More specially , the \nlower the temp o is, th e finer resolution (via interpolation, \nfor instance) is requi red to achieve a high precision. To \navoid such extra work for maintaining the precision, here we \nuse STFT to obtain the tempo curve in our study .

(d) Novelty curve after local mean sub traction  \n \nAs mentioned above, we do not have to analyze all \nfrequency components in the novelty  curve. Therefore, a \npartial FFT method  is employed to eliminate  high-frequency \ncomputation  in STFT . Furthermore , the selection of \nanalyz ing window length  significantly influence s the \ncapability  for tracking tempo variation. In  our \nimplementation, the frame size is set to be  4 second s with \n99.6%  overlap . The resulting tempogram is  shown in Figure  \n3(a). \nIn order to stri ke a balance between tempo continuity \nand novelty curve strength, a  DP-based approach is used to \nobtain the tempo curve . Given the magnitude  ùëÄùëñ,ùëó of a point  \nin the tempogram with time index ùëñ (1‚â§ùëñ‚â§ùëõ), we want to \nfind a tempo path   ùêè= ÔøΩùíëùüè,‚ãØ,ùíëùíä‚ãØ,ùíëùíèÔøΩ, with ùëùùëñ  is tempo \nvalue , such that the over -all objective  utility function  is \nmaximized : \n \n \nJ(ùêè,ùúÉ)  = ‚àëùëÄùëñ,ùëùùëñùëõ\nùëñ=1‚àí Œ∏√ó‚àë |ùëùùëñ‚àíùëùùëñ+1|ùëõ‚àí1\nùëñ=1  , (2) \n \nwhere ùúÉ is the transition penalty factor incurred by the \ndiffer ence of the tempo path within two  consecutive frames.  \nThe first term in the utility  function is the magnitude values along the path over the tempogra m, while the second term \ncontrols  the smoothness of the path (thus the computed \ntempo curve). If Œ∏ is larger, then the tempo curve will be \nsmoother. In particular , if ùúÉ = 0 in the extreme case, then \nmaximizing  the utility  function is equivalent to maximum -\npicking of each column  (or equivalently, each frame ) of the \ntempogram . \n     For efficiency, we shall employ DP to find the maximum \nof the utility  function, where the optimum -valued function \nùê∑(ùëñ,ùëó) is defined as the maximum utility  starting from \nframe 1 to ùëñ, with  the frequency/ tempo index ending at  ùëó \n(1‚â§ùëó‚â§ùëö). Then the recurrent equation for DP can be \nformulated as follows:  \n \nùê∑(ùëñ,ùëó)=ùëÄùëñ,ùëó+ùëöùëéùë•ùëò,ùëó‚àà[1,ùëö]{ùê∑(ùëñ‚àí1,ùëò)‚àíùúÉ√óùë°ùëë(ùëò,ùëó)}          (3) \nwhere  ùëñ‚àà[2,ùëõ],ùëò ùëéùëõùëë  ùëó are tempo  index  \n     td (Ôºé) is tempo difference function  \n      \nThe initial conditions are  \n \nùê∑(1,ùëó)=ùëÄ1,ùëó,ùëó‚àà[1,ùëö]                                       ( 4) \n \nAnd the maximum utility  is equal to ùëÄùê¥ùëãùëó‚àà[1,ùëö]ùê∑(ùëõ,ùëó). A \nsimilar DP -based pitch tracking method has been proposed \nfor tone recognition in our previous work [ 13].  \nIn prac tice, we can replace ùë°ùëë(ùëò,ùëó) in the recurrent \nequation with ùë°ùëë(ùëò,ùëó)=|ùëùùëò‚àíùëùùëó|, which represents the \ntempo difference between tempo indices  ùëò and ùëó. This is \nadopted in our implementation.  Figure 4 demonstrates \ntypical results of DP over a tempogram, with (a) and (b) \nbeing the tempogram ùëÄ and the DP table ùê∑, respectively, \ntogether with the optimum path obtained via DP. Figure 4 (c) \nand (d) shows the same plots using a 3D surface for easy \nvisualization.  \nAs a common  practice in DP, after  the maximum utility  is \nfound, we can backtrack to  find the optimum path  together  \nwith the mos t likely tempo curve , as shown in Figure  3(b). \nThe transition penalty factor ùúÉ controls tempo variations, \nthat is, it determines the smoothness of tempo curve, as \nshown in Figure  3(c), where a larger value of   ùúÉ leads to a \nsmoother tempo curve.  In our experiment, the transition \npenalty factor ùúÉ is set to 0.01 empirically  in order to track \nthe correct tempos . \n       \nTime(sec)Mel Band(a)\n  \n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 50102030\n-60-40-20\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 500.0050.010.0150.02(b)\nTime(sec)Amplitude\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5246810x 10-3 (c)\nTime(sec)Amplitude\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 502468x 10-3 (d)\nTime(sec)Amplitude\nTime(sec)Beats Per Minute(BPM)(a)\n  \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5100200300400\n0.050.10.15\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 50100200300400500(b)\nTime(sec)Tempo(BPM)\n193Poster Session 2\n \nFigure 3.

To \nreduce the computation, we can simply pick the ùêø largest \nlocal maxima within each column of the tempogram as the \ncandi date states for DP, as shown in Figure  3 (b). In our \nexperiment, this simplified algorithm with L equal to 10 can \nachieve almost the same  performance as the original DP.  \n \n2.3 Beat Tracking  \n               \nThis block utilizes  both the tempo curve and the novelty \ncurve  to find a sequence of beat positions that fits the tempo \ncurve and the novelty strengths  as much as possible. To \nachieve  this task, we apply another DP -based method in a \nprobabilistic  framework (just like Viterbi search in speech \nrecognition) to perform forward and back ward  beat tracking , \nstarting  from the anchor beat position  (the position of the \nmost prominent  peak) of the novelty curve.  We have proposed such a probability -based DP framework for pitch \nmark identification [14]. Another  DP-based approach has \nbeen proposed for stable -tempo beat tracking [ 1], though not \nin a probabilistic  framework . \nHere  we use Figure  5 to explain the weighting -based DP \nmethod  for beat position identification . First of all, we find \nthe maximum of the novelty curve as the first beat position, \nwhich is referred to as the anchor candidate. Starting from \nthe anchor candidate, we search on both  sides, one side at a \ntime, to obtain all beat positions. The search regio n is \ngener ally defined as a range from 0.2  to 2.2 times ùëá, the \nbeat period at the anchor candidate. We use a log -time \nGaussian function over the search region as a weighting window for approximat ing the transition probability. Note \nthat the maximum of the  log-time Gaussian window is \nlocated at ùëá from the anchor candidate.  \nIn practice, only the largest  ùëÅ peaks of the novelty curve \nwithin the next search region are selected as the candidates \nfor the next beat posi tions. As a result, we need to perform \nnormalization to guaran tee that the transition probabilities \nsum to 1 within the search region. Similarly, the state \nprobabilities of these ùëÅ candidates are obtained based on \ntheir heights within the novelty curve.  \n \n \n \nFigure 5.  Backward beat search  with ùëÅ =2  \n \nOnce the state and transition probabilities are defined, we \ncan apply DP just like Viterbi search for the optimum beat \npositions. The search  is performed  twice for both forward \nand backward directions from the anchor candidate, and the \nresults of them are merged to obtain the complete beat \npositions. In our experiment, we set N  to 2. Figure  6 shows a \ntypical result with ùúÉ = 0.01 and ùëÅ=2. \n   \nFigure 6.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATIO N \n \nIn this section, we present the performance of the proposed  \nalgorithm by using the results of the Audio Beat Tracking \ncontest  in Music Information Retrieval Evaluation \neXchange (MIREX) 2010  [8]. \n \n3.1 Performance Indices  \n \nThere are a number of performance indice s proposed for the \naudio beat tracking task in MIREX 2010 [8]. For simplicity, \nhere w e explain  two performance indice s which are \ngenerally adopted in beat tracking evaluation among all . The \nfirst one is F -measure [9] which  considers the  estimated beat \nas correct if it is within a tolerance window (¬±70ms in \nMIREX 2010)  around the ground truth.  The second one is \nP-score [10] which  measures  beat tracking  accuracy by the \nsummation  of the cross -correlation between  impulse trains  \nof the estimated  beats and the ground truth.  \n \n3.2 Data sets \n \nTwo music data sets are used to evaluate the performance of \nthe proposed system with  stable  and time -varying tempo, \nrespectively.  \n \n- MCK  dataset:  \nÔÉò Collected by Martin F. McKinney and Dirk Moelants . \nÔÉò Contains  160 30- second excerpts . \nÔÉò Ground truth is annotated as stable  tempo . \nÔÉò A large variety of instrumentation and musical styles.  \n \n- MAZ dataset:  \nÔÉò Collected by Craig Sapp . \nÔÉò A subset of 367 Chopin Mazurka pieces  [10]. \nÔÉò Ground truth is annotated as time -varying tempo .  \n \n3.3 Performance and discussion \n \nTable s 1 and 2 show the performance of participating  team s \nin MIREX 2010 a udio beat tracking task on stable  and time -\nvarying tempo respectively. Only the best method s from \neach team  are listed here.  Algorithm TL2 uses the proposed \nmethod in this paper.  LGG2 and MRVCC1 accomplish this \ntask based on BeatRoot system  proposed by Simon Dixon  \n[5]. NW1 is based on Predominant  Local Pulse curves  (PLP) \n[6]. GP3 estimates beat and downbeat position s [11 ] \nsimult aneously  via an inverse Viterbi formulation  and LDA -\ntrained  beat-template  [3]. ZTC1 tracks beat with  a global \nstable  tempo value . BES4 is based on bidirectional Long \nShort -Term Memory (BLSTM) recurrent neural networks .  \n \nAlgorithm  \nID TL2 LGG2  MRVCC1 NW1  GP3  ZTC1  BES4  \nF-\nMeasure  42.0 50.0 25.7 35.6 50.3 1.2 54.5 \nP-Score  50.6 55.0 38.4 45.7 56.5 0.9 59.2 \nTable  1. Performance on MCK dataset  (stable  tempos)   As shown in Table 1, the proposed algorithm (TL2) only \nperforms moderately well on MCK dataset which has stable  \ntempos. The performance in this dataset indicates we might have put too much emphasis on tracking tempo variations \ninstead of identifying stable  tempos. In other words, we \nmight want to increase the value of the transition p enalty \nfactor  ùúÉ  such that the tempo variations can be kept small for \nthis dataset.  \n \nAlgorithm  \nID TL2 LGG2  MRVCC1 NW1  GP3  ZTC1  BES4  \nF-\nMeasure  68.5 41.5 49.2 27.6 47.1 24.6 58.7 \nP-Score  72.2 43.5 51.0 31.4 48.7 26.1 57.9 \nTable  2.

More \nspecifically, if we consider all the submitted algorithms and \nall the performance measures,  the proposed algorithm \noutperforms other 12 submitted algorithms on 6 \nperformance indice s out of 9, as shown in Figure. 7 . (Note \nthat in the Figure, we only show  7 performance indi ces for \nclarity. Moreover, the performance measure  by Goto is not \ncounted since it is close to zero for all submitted algorithms.) \nThis clearly demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed \ntwo-fold DP  strategy for dealing with music of time -varying \ntempos.  \n \n4. CONCLUSION S \n \nIn this paper, we have propose d a two-fold DP approach to \nbeat tracking, especially for time -varying tempo musi c. The \nfirst DP is applied to estimate the tempo curve from the \ntempogram, and the second DP is used to find the optimum \nbeat positions with maximum likelihood. The proposed \nmethod is very similar to our previous work on speech \nanalysis, where the first DP is used for  robust pitch \ndetermination [13] and the second DP for robust  pitch \nmarking [14] . Based on the results of the a udio beat tracking \ncontest of MIREX 2010, the proposed method performs ex-\ntremely well for music with time -varying tempos, but only \nmoderately well for music with stable  tempos.

We describe a sys-tematic investigation to provide useful capabilities to musi-cians both in rehearsal and when practicing alone. Our goal is to allow musicians to automatically record, organize, and retrieve rehearsal (and other) audio to facilitate review and practice (for example, playing along with difficult pas-sages). W e  i n t r o d u c e  a  n o v e l  m u s i c  c l a s s i f i cation system based on Eigenmusic and Adaboost to separate rehearsal recordings into segments, an unsupervised clustering and alignment process to organize segments, and a digital music display interface that provides both graphical input and out-put in terms of conventional music notation. 1. INTRODUCTION Music Information Retrieval promises new capabilities and new applications in the domain of music. Consider a per-sonal music database composed of rehearsal recordings. Music is captured by continuously recording a series of re-hearsals, where the music is often played in fragments and may be played by different subsets of the full ensemble. These recordings can become a valuable resource for musi-cians, but accessing and organizing recordings by hand is time consuming. To make rehearsal recordings more useful, there are three main processing tasks that can be automated. ( S e e  Figure 1.) The first is to separate the sound into music and non-music segments. T h e  m u s i c  s e g m e n t s  w i l l  c o n s i s t  o f  many repetitions of the same material. Many if not most of the segments will be fragments of an entire composition. We want to organize the segments, clustering them by composition, and aligning them to one another (and possi-bly to other recordings of the music). Finally, we want to coordinate the clustered and aligned music with an interface to allow convenient access. We see these capabilities as the foundation for an inte-grated system in which musicians can practice and compare their intonation, tempo, and phrasing to existing recordings or to rehearsal data from others. By performing alignment in real time, the display could also turn pages automati-cally. The next section presents a novel method for mu-sic/non-music classification and segmentation. Section 3 describes how to organize the segments. Section 4 de-scribes a two-way interface to the audio. \n Figure 1. System diagram for a musician's personal audio database. Rehearsal recordings are automatically processed for simple search, analysis, and playback using a music no-tation-based user interface.\u00012. CLASSIFICATION AND SEGMENTATION 2.1 Related Work Much work has been done in the area of classification and segmentation on speech and music. For different tasks, people extract different features. Some f o c u s  o n  b a ck-ground music detection [6], while others detect s p e e c h  o r  music sections in TV programs or broadcast radio. Many features have been tested in the realm of speech/music clas-sification [ 8 ,  1 7 ]. Two frequently used ones are Spectral-Centroid and Zero-Crossing Rate. Also, different statistical models have been used. Two of them, long window sam-pling [7] a n d  the HMM segmentation framework [ 1 ,  1 4 ], are especially relevant to our work. Other approaches in-clude using decision trees [16] and Bayesian networks [5]. However, the particular problem of variations i n  the sound source seems to be largely ignored. In reality, sound is not standardized in volume or bandwidth and may even contain different kinds of noise. In these cases, more robust features and methods are needed. This section will concen-trate on new feature extraction and model design methods  Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.  ¬© 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n139Poster Session 1\n   to achieve music/non-music classification and segmentation on realistic rehearsal audio.  2.2 Eigenmusic Feature Extraction  The concept of Eigenmusic is derived from the well-known representation of images in terms of Eigenfaces [12]. The process of generating Eigenmusic can be performed in both the time and frequency domains, and in either case, simply refers to the result of the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the audio data [3]. Therefore, Eigenmusic refers to t h e  eigenvectors of an empirical covariance matrix associated with an array of music data. The array of music data is structured as a spectrogram and hence contains the spectral information of the audio in those time intervals. When expressing non-music d a t a  i n terms of Eigenmusic, the coefficients are g e n e r a l l y  expected to be outlying based o n the fundamentally different characteristics of music and non-music.  In practice, we use about 2.5 hours of pure music in the training data collection to extract the Eigenmusic in the fre-quency domain. First, let X = [x1, x2, ‚Ä¶ , xT] be a spectro-gram, a matrix consisting of, in its columns, m a g n i t u d e spectra corresponding to 1.25 second non-overlapping win-dows of the incoming music data. Second, the correspond-ing empirical covariance matrix, Cx, a n d  i t s  E i g e n v e c t o r s  are computed. Ultimately, we retain the first 10 eigenvec-tors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. If P i s  t h e matrix of column-wise eigenvectors of Cx, given a new magnitude spectrum column vector x, we can represent its Eigenmusic coefficients b y  PTx, which will be a 10-dimensional vector. 2.3 Adaboost Classifier  Adaboost [18] is a very interesting classification algorithm, which follows a simple idea: to develop a sequence of hy-potheses for classification and combine the classification results to make the final decision. Each simple hypothesis is individually considered a weak classifier, h(PTx), a n d  t h e  combined complex hypothesis is considered to be the strong classifier. In the training step, each weak classifier focuses on instances where the previous classifier failed. Then it will obtain a weight, Œ±t, and update the weight of individual training data based on its performance. In the decoding step, the strong classifier is taken to be the sign of the weighted sum of weak classifiers: H(x)=sign(Œ±tht(PTx))t‚àë                            (1) By training a sequence of linear classifiers ht, each one of which merely compares a n  i n d ividual Eigenmusic coeffi-cient against a threshold that minimizes the weighted error, Adaboost is able to implement a  n o n-linear classification surface in the 10-dimensional Eigenmusic space. 2.3.1 Data Collection and Representation The Adaboost training data is a collection of about 5 hours of rehearsal and performance recordings of western music; while the testing data is a collection of 2.5 hours of Chinese music. For the music parts, each data c o l l e c t i o n  contains different combinations of w i n d  i n s t r u m e n t s ,  s t r i n g  i n s t ru-ments, and singing. For the non-music parts, each data col-lection contains speech, silence, applause, noise, etc. Both data collections are labeled as music or non-music at the frame level (1.25 seconds). From Section 2.2, we know that each frame is a point in the 10-dimensional Eigenmusic space. Therefore, we have about 5 (hours) √ó 3600 (s/hour) / 1.25 (s/frame) = 14,400 frames for training and 7,200 frames for testing. 2.3.2 Implementation and Evaluation  We train 100 weak classifiers to construct the final strong classifier. The testing accuracy is shown in Figure 2. The results were obtained in terms of the percentage of error at the frame level. Two different statistics h a v e  b e e n  c a l cu-lated: the percentage of true music identified as non-music, shown as the solid line, and the percentage of true non-music identified as music, shown as the dotted line. \n02040608010000.050.10.150.20.250.30.35\nnumber of weak classifierserror rateerror rate of testing data\n  musicnon√Ømusic Figure 2. The testing error of music and non-music. From Figure 2, it can be seen that the proposed Adaboost classifier in the Eigenmusic space is capable of achieving a low error rate (about 5.5%) on both music and non-music data, even when the testing data comes from a completely different sound source from the training data. 2.3.3 Probabilistic Interpretation  We can improve the frame level classification by consider-ing that state changes between music and non-music do not occur rapidly. We can model rehearsals as a two-state hid-den Markov model (HMM) [13]. Formally, given a vector x, let y ‚àà {-1,1} represent its true label. Here, -1 stands for non-music and 1 stands for music. And let w(x) represent the weighted sum of weak classifiers: \n14012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   w(x)=Œ±tht(PTx)t‚àë                             (2) In Equation (1), we took the sign of w(x) as the decision, but we can modify this approach to compute the a posteri-ori probability of y = 1, given the weighted sum, which we denote as the function F: F(w(x))=P(y=1|w(x))                        (3) According to the discussion in [15], F(w(x)) is a  l o g i s t i c  function, as shown in Equation 4: F(w(x))=11+exp(‚àí2‚ãÖw(x))                     (4) In Figure 3, the small circles show P(y = 1 | w(x)) estimated from training data sorted into bins according to w(x). The logistic function is shown as the solid curve. It can be seen that our empirical data matches the theoretical probability quite well. \n√Ø3√Ø2√Ø10123400.20.40.60.81\nw(x)p(y=1|w(x))logistic estimation\n Figure 3. The logistic function estimation on training data. We note that the idea of linking Adaboost with HMMs is not new, but very little work has been done to implement it [4, 19]. As far as we know, this is the first attempt of a probabilistic i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of A d a b o o s t  w h e n  l i n k e d  w i t h  HMMs.  2.4 HMM Smoothing for Segmentation  The significance of smoothing is that even a very low error rate at t h e  f r a m e  l e v e l  c a n n o t  guarantee a  s a t i s f y i n g  s eg-mentation result overall (i.e. at the piece level). For exam-ple, suppose a relatively low 5% error rate is obtained at the frame level. If the segmentation rule is to separate the target audio at every non-music frame, a 10 minute long pure mu-sic piece would be cut into about 25 pieces in this case. Ul-timately, this is an undesirable result.  Based on typical characteristics of rehearsal audio data, we assume that: (1) music and non-music frames cannot alternate frequently, and (2) short duration music and non-music intervals are less likely than longer ones. By utilizing these assumptions in conjunction with the HMM, low (but possibly deleterious) frame-level error rates can be further reduced. We use a fully-connected HMM with o n l y  t w o  states, representing music and non-music. The H M M ob-servation corresponding to every frame x is a real number w(x), as in Equation (2), given by the Adaboost classifier. 2.4.1 HMM Training The training data collection m e n t i o n e d i n S e c t i o n 2 . 3 . 1  is used to estimate the HMM parameters. Formally, let S = [S1, S2,‚Ä¶,ST] b e  t h e  s t a t e  s e q u e n c e  a n d  l e t  O =  [O1, O2,‚Ä¶,OT] be the observation sequence. Since it is a super-vised learning problem, we do Maximum Likelihood Esti-mation (MLE) by counting or just manually setting the pa-rameters f o r  i n i t i a l  s t a t e  p r o b a b i l i t i e s  a n d  t r a n s i t i o n  p r ob-abilities. For emission probabilities, we use Bayes‚Äô rule: P(Ot|St=1)=P(St=1|Ot)‚ãÖP(Ot)P(St=1)          (5) Remember that in our model Ot = w(xt) and P(Ot) is a con-stant. Therefore, if we plug in function F a c c o r d i n g  t o  Equation (3), we obtain the estimate of the emission prob-ability of music w h e r e  C d e n o t e s  a  c o n s t a n t  s c a l a r  m u l ti-plier: P(Ot|St=1)=C‚ãÖF(w(xt))P(St=1)                 (6)\u0001Using the same method, we obtain the estimate of the emis-sion probability of non-music: P(Ot|St=‚àí1)=C‚ãÖ1‚àíF(w(xt))P(St=‚àí1)              (7) Here, we set the a priori probability of both music and non-music to 0.5 and then apply the Viterbi algorithm [13] t o  efficiently find the best possible state sequence for a given observation sequence. 2.4.2 Implementation and Evaluation At the frame level, HMM smoothing reduced the error rate from about 5.5% to 1.8% on music and to 2.2% on non-music. This is the same as the best claimed result [17] i n  the references [6, 7, 8, 17], where classifiers were tested on cleaner data sets not related to our application. Since the piece level evaluation has been largely ignored in previous works o n music/non-music segmentation, we adopt an evaluation method from s p e e c h  s e g m e n t a t i o n  [20] called Fuzzy Recall and Precision. This method pays more atten-tion to insertion and deletion than boundary precision. We get a Fuzzy Precision of 89.5% and Fuzzy Recall of 97%. The high Fuzzy Recall reflects that all true boundaries are well detected with only some imprecision a r o u n d  t h e  boundaries. The lower Fuzzy Precision reflects that about 10% of the detected boundaries are not true ones.  \n141Poster Session 1\n   3. CLUSTERING OF MUSIC SEGMENTS Assuming perfect classification results from the previous step, the clustering task is a distinct problem. Our goal is to cluster the musical segments belonging to the same piece. 3.1 Feature Extraction Chroma vectors [2] have been widely used as a robust har-monic feature in all kinds of MIR tasks. The chroma vector represents the spectral energy distribution in each of the 12 pitch classes (C, C#, D,‚Ä¶ A#, B). Such features strongly correlate to the harmonic progression of the audio.  Considering the objective that our system should be ro-bust to external factors (e.g. a u d i e n c e  cheering and ap-plause), the feature cannot be too sensitive to minor varia-tions. Therefore, as suggested by M√ºller, we first calculate 12-dimensional chroma vectors using 200ms windows with 50% overlap, then compute a  l o n g e r-term summary by windowing over 41 consecutive short-term vectors and normalizing, with a 10-vector (1s) hop-size. These long-term feature vectors are described as CENS features (Chroma Energy distribution Normalized Statistics) [10, 11]. The length of the long-term window and hop size can be changed to take global tempo differences into account. 3.2 Audio Matching and Clustering  Given the CENS features, audio matching can be achieved by simply correlating the query clip Q = (q1, q2, ‚Ä¶ qM) with the subsequences of musical segments P = (p1, p2, ‚Ä¶ pN) in the database (assume N >  M). Here, a l l  l o w e r  c a s e  l e t t e r s  (e.g. qi, pi) represent 12-dimensional CENS vectors. Thus, Q and P are both sequences of CENS vectors over time. As in [11], the distance between the query clip Q and the sub-sequence P(i) = (pi, pi+1,‚Ä¶ pi+M-1) is: dist(Q, P(i)) = 1-1Mqk,pi+k‚àí1k=1M‚àë              (8) Here <qk, pi+k-1> denotes the dot product between these two CENS vectors. All of the distances for i\u0001= 1, 2, ... N‚àíM+1 together can be considered a distance function ‚àÜ b e t w e e n  query clip Q and each of the musical segments P in the da-tabase. If the minimum distance is less than a preset thresh-old Œ≥, then Q can be clustered with P.  One problem with this decision scheme is that, unlike a traditional song retrieval system which has a large reference database in advance, our system has no prior information about the rehearsal audio stream. We are only given a stream o f  potentially unordered and unlabeled audio t h a t  needs to be clustered. To solve this problem, we construct the database from the input audio dynamically. The inputs are all the music segments obtained from Section 2, and the algorithm is: 1. Sort all the music segments according to their length. 2. Take out the longest segment S. i) If database D is empty, put S into D as a cluster.  ii) Otherwise match S w i t h  e v e r y  s e g m e n t  i n  D b y  calculating distance function ‚àÜ. Let Dm be the segment in D with the best match. (1) If the distance function ‚àÜ of Dm with S has a minimum less than Œ≥, cluster S with Dm. (2) Otherwise make S a new cluster in D. iii) Repeat step 2 until all segments are clustered. Here we made a critical assumption: the longest segment is m o s t  l i k e l y  t o  b e  a  w h o l e  p i e c e  o r  a t  l e a s t  t h e  l o n g e s t  segment for this distinct piece, so it is reasonable to let it represent a new cluster. At every step of the iteration, we take out a new segment S which is guaranteed to be shorter than any of the segments in database D. This implies it can either be part of an existing piece in the database (in which case we will cluster it with a matching segment) or it is a segment for a new piece which does not yet exist in the da-tabase (in which case we will make it a new cluster). We also need to consider the possibility that tempo dif-ferences cause misalignment between sequences. We can obtain different versions of CENS features ( f o r  example, from 10% slower to 10% faster) for the same segment to represent the possible tempos. This is achieved by adjusting the length of the long-term w indow and the hop size as mentioned in Section 3.1. During matching, the version of the segment w i t h  t h e  l o w e s t  distance function minimum will be chosen.  3.2.1 Segment Length vs. Threshold Value While t i m e scaling compensates for global tempo differ-ences, it does not account for local variation within seg-ments. It is interesting to consider the length of the query clip that is used to correlate with the segments in the data-base. Intuitively, longer clips will be more selective, reduc-ing spurious matches. However, if the length is too large, e.g. two segments both longer than 5 minutes, sequence misalignments due to tempo variation will decrease the cor-relation and increase the distance. If longer segments lead to greater distance, one might compensate w i t h  l a r g e r  threshold values (Œ≥). However, larger Œ≥ values may not prove strict enough to filter out noise, leading to clustering errors. We will compare two pairs of configurations: longer segments with larger Œ≥ and shorter segments with smaller Œ≥. 3.2.2 Experiments and Evaluation We have two parameters to control: Œ≥, which determines if the two segments are close enough to be clustered together, and t, the length of the segments. We use hours of rehearsal recordings as test data, with styles that include c l a ssical, \n14212th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n   rock, and jazz. We also use live performance recordings, which are typically even longer. To evaluate the clustering results, we use the F-measure as discussed in [9]:  P=TPTP+FP, R=TPTP+FN                          (9) \u0001\u0001FŒ≤=(Œ≤2+1)PRŒ≤2P+R                                   (10) Here, P (precision) and R (recall) are determined by 4 dif-ferent variables: TP ( t r u e  p o s i t i v e ) w h i c h corresponds to assigning two similar segments to the same cluster, TN (true negative) corresponding to a s s i g n i n g  t w o  d i s s i m i l a r  segments to the different clusters, FP (false positive) corre-sponding to assigning two dissimilar segments to the same cluster, and FN ( f a l s e  n e g a t i v e )  which corresponds to as-signing two similar segments to different clusters. Œ≤ is the tuning parameter used to adjust the emphasis on precision or recall. In our case, it is more important to avoid cluster-ing segments from different pieces into one cluster than it is to avoid ‚Äúoversegmenting‚Äù by creating too many clusters. The latter case is more easily rectified manually. Thus, we would like to penalize more on false positives, which leads to choosi ng Œ≤ < 1.  Her e, we use Œ≤ = 0. 9.  Considering the possible noise near the beginning and the end of the record-ings, we choose the middle t s e c o n d s  if the segment is shorter than the original recording. \u0001As seen in Figure 4, for segments longer than 3 minutes, the relatively larger Œ≥ = 0.25 outperforms others, while for shorter segments around 20s to 60s, the smaller Œ≥ = 0.15 has the best performance. It is also shown that if Œ≥ i s  s e t  t o o  large (0.35), the performance drops drastically. Overall, shorter segments and smaller Œ≥ g i v e  u s  b e t t e r  results than longer segments and larger Œ≥. Finally, since calculating cor-relation has O(n2) complexity, shorter segment lengths can also save significant computation. Thus, our current system uses a segment length t = 40s and Œ≥ = 0.15. K-means clus-tering was also tested but did not work as well as our algo-rithm because of the non-uniform segment length and un-known number of clusters (details omitted for reasons of space). 4. USER INTERFACE Ultimately, we plan to integrate our rehearsal audio into a digital music display and practice support system (see Fig-ure 5.). While listening to a performance, the user can tap on music locations to establish a correspondence between music audio and music notation. Once the music has been annotated in this manner, audio-to-audio alignment (a by-product of clustering) can be used to align other audio automatically. The user can then point to a music passage in order to call up a menu of matching audio sorted by date, length, tempo, or other attributes. The user can then prac-tice with the recording in order to work on tempo, phrasing, or intonation, or the user might simply review a recent re-hearsal, checking on known trouble spots. One of the excit-ing elements of this interface is that we can make useful audio available quickly through a natural, intuitive interface (music notation). It is easy to import scanned images of no-tation into the system and create these interfaces. \n05010015020025030035040000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91\nSegment Length (s)F√Ømeasure\n  \na = 0.15a = 0.20a = 0.25a = 0.30a = 0.35 Figure 4.

CONCLUSIONS We have presented a system for automated management of a personal audio database for practicing musicians. The system segments recordings and organizes them through unsupervised clustering and alignment. An interface based on common music notation allows the user to quickly re-trieve music audio for practice or review. Our work intro-duces Eigenmusic as a music detection feature, a probabil-istic connection between Adaboost and HMMs, an unsu-pervised clustering algorithm for music audio organization, and a notation-based interface that takes advantage of audio-to-audio alignment. In the future, we will fully inte-grate these components and test them with actual users. 6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0855958.

Audio finge r-\nprints have recently attracted much attention in music i n-\nformation  retrieval,  for they provide a compact represent a-\ntion of the perceptually  relevant parts of audio signals. In \nthis paper, we propose an extrem ely fast  method of explo r-\ning a huge Hamming space for audio fingerprinting  systems. \nThe effectiveness of the proposed method has been eva-\nluated  by experiments using a database of 8,740 songs.  \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nJust as fingerprint s are  used for identifying huma n being s, \naudio fingerprint s can be used to identify  music . Audio fi n-\ngerprints , together with a music information database , can \nbe used to derive  information about an unknown aud io clip \nautomatically, such as the  names of the song , artist and a l-\nbum. Gracenote [1] and Mido mi [2] are two  well-known \ncommercial service s. They  retrieve a song by using a few \nseconds of music clip  caught by such as a PC or mobile \nphone , display  the title of the song and other information, \nand also enable the user to download the song from a web -\nbased music store.  In recent years, audio finger print s have  \nalso attracted attention as a technique for copyright prote c-\ntion of music, such as detecting  the distribution of copy-\nright -infringing songs  on the Internet.   \n    In general, an audio  clip is given as a search query , and it \ndoes not necessarily start at the beginning of the song. \nTherefore, a retrieval method should consider any time as a \nstarting position , but this requires a long c omputation time. \nIn order to solve this problem, fast and effe ctive retrieval \nmethods are necessary . Some e fficient retrieval  method s based on audio fingerprin ts have been proposed, including  \na method using a hash table [3][4] and a tree-structure d re-\npresentation of fingerprints  [5]. \n    A query is an excerpt of a song , but it may be ‚Äúcorrupted ‚Äù \nby being mixed wit h environmental noise, or it may have \nbeen  modified by a low -pass filter. As a result, retrieval \nmethods  should be able to handle  queries which are similar \nto, but not exactly the same as a song in the database. Lo-\ncality -Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is an emerging technique  \nfor solving large -scale similarity re trieval in high -\ndimensional spaces, and has been applied  in extensive r e-\nsearch fields  [6-8]. \n   In this paper, w e propose a fast method for exploring a \nhuge Hamming space which  is suitable for audio finge r-\nprinting  systems  building on the ideas of LSH . There have \nbeen s everal previous proposals on H amming space retrie v-\nal methods based on  LSH,  however , our method uses less \nmemory . The effectiveness of the proposed method is dem-\nonstrated  by evaluation experiments using a database of \n8,740 songs.  The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 \noutlines  music retrieval based on audio fingerprint s. We \npropose a fast music retrieval method  particu larly suitable \nfor audio fingerprinting sys tems in Section 3, and evaluate \nthe method in Section 4. Finally, w e conclude  the paper  in \nSection 5.  \n2. OVERVIEW O F MUSIC RETRIEVAL BASE D ON \nAUDIO FINGERPRINT S \nAudio fingerprinting  is a kind of message digest ( one-way \nhash function), and it  converts an audio signal into a rela-\ntively compact representation by using acoustical and pe r-\nceptional characteristics of the audio  signals . For message \ndigesting methods used for authentication and digital sign a-\ntures (e.g. MD5), slight difference in the original objects \nresults in totally different hash values . This means that two \nhash values mapp ed from an  original  audio si gnal and a \ncorrupted one are completely diffe rent, which  drastically \ndecreases the retrieval performance for ‚Äúcorrupted ‚Äù queries. \nHowever, in audio fingerprint ing, similar inputs are hashed \nto similar hash values.   \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use  is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that co p-\nies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.   \n¬© 2011  International Society for Music Information Retrieval  \n133Poster Session 1\n  \n \n    Music retrieval based on audio fingerprinting involves \nsome key problems: (1) which  type of audio fingerprints  to \nuse, (2) how to define the distance between two fingerprints, \nand (3) how to retrieve from a huge data base. We review \nthese problems  next. \n2.1 Audio Fingerprint  Extraction   \nA variety of  audio fingerprint extraction algorithm s have \nbeen proposed  based on different acoustic feature s, such as \nFourier coefficients  [9], Mel frequency cepstral  coefficients  \n[10], spectral flatne ss [11] and so on . In particular, the fin-\ngerprint extraction algorithm  by Haitsma and Kalker  [3] \nuses a feature of the energy difference betwe en frequ ency \nband s as follows .   \n    First, an input audio signal  is segmented into frames , and \nthen 32 -bit sub -fingerprints are extracted from each ove r-\nlapping frame . Sub-fingerprints  are actually calculated in \nthe frequency domain . Each frame  is first converted into a \nfrequency domain  by using FFT, and then segmented into \n33 non-overlapping frequency bands . Next , a sub-\nfingerprint  is calculated by checking the sign (plus or minus)  \nof the energy difference  between two successive  frequency \nband s. Haitsma and Kalker  [3] used a frame length of 0.37 \nsecond  with an overlap factor of 31/32 , so a sub-fingerprint  \nwas extract ed for every 11.6 millisecond s. \n    The sub-fingerprint s are calculated as follows : let E(n, m) \nbe the power  of frequency band m of frame n, then the m-th \nbit of f rame n, F(n, m), is determined as:  \n                                \n                        Ôºå                                                                                                                                                                      \nwhere \n                                    \n                                           (2)            \nHaitsma and Kalker  [3] demonstrated that the sign of \npower  differences between successive frequency bands was \neffective  for identifying music , and was also robust against \nvarious ‚Äúcorrupted ‚Äù input s such as comp ressed or delayed \nmusic . The Haitsma and Kalker  algorithm can be impl e-\nmented  by simple arithmetic,  while maintaining  compact  \nrepresentation for generated  audio fingerprint s. \n2.2 Distance between Audio Fingerprint s \nThe sub-fingerprint  is a 32 -bit feature extracted  from a \nframe in an input  audio , and one sub -fingerprint  does not \nhave  enough  information to identify the audio . To obtain \nsufficient  information, a fingerprint block , which is a s e-\nquence of sub -fingerprints, is used for matching audio sub -\nfingerprint s. A fingerprint bl ock con sisting  of 256 sub -\nfingerprints was used in the experiments in [3]. \n     Bit error rate is used as the distance between two finge r-\nprint  blocks.  Let FA(n, m), FB(n, m) be the sub -fingerprints \nextracted from audio  clips A and B respectively . The bit e r-ror rate of fingerprint block BER(A, B) of length N is for-\nmally defined as:  \n                               \n      \n   \n              \nThe operator ^ denotes  bitwise  operation  XOR ( exclusive \nor). The n umerator of Equation  (3) calculates  the Hamming \ndistance between two fingerprint blocks, which is divided \nby the bit length of fingerprint block s (32N). BER(A,B) is \nthe error rate per bit.  \n2.3 Audio Fingerprint  Search  \nMost music retrieval methods based on audio fingerprinting \nhave the following stages.  First, fingerprint blocks are e x-\ntracted from each song in the database.  Because of the u n-\nknown position of the query , all variations of starting point \nshould be considered. Therefore, each song allows extrac t-\ning quite a number of fingerprint blocks  by shifting all the \nframes to fingerprint blocks one by one . When a query is \ngiven,  many fingerprint blocks are also extracted from the \nquery. Thus, m usic retrieval involves finding the fingerprint \nblock in the database that is most similar to the fingerp rint \nblock derived from the query . \n     The search space of audio fingerprinting is huge . For \nexample , a fingerprint database containing  10,000 songs \neach with an average length of 5 minu tes would result in \napproximately 250 million fingerprint blocks in total using \nthe algorithm in [3].  The number of distance calculation s \nwould be  several to several dozen  times as large as 250 mi l-\nlion by brute -force search taking account of matching the \nfingerprint blocks . Many ways of reducing the number of \ncalculatio ns have been proposed , such as using a hash table \n(lookup table) for sub -fingerprints [3 ], a tree -structur ed re-\npresentation of sub-fingerprints [ 5], and a hash table co n-\nsisting of peak values in the frequency doma in and duration  \nbetween the two peak s [4]. However, with these methods \nthe size of the hash table grows  rapidly with the bit error \nrates between the query and songs in the  database  increa s-\ning. \n3. FAST HAMMING SPACE SEARCH  FOR  AUDIO \nFINGERPRINTS  \nIn this section, we propose a fast retrieval method for audio \nfingerprint ing systems . Suppose that audio fingerprints are \nrepresented by binary bit vector s, and the Hamming di s-\ntance is used for the distance between two audio finge r-\nprints.  We first outline the search methods for Hamming  \nspace based on LSH in Section 3.1, and then propose a new \nretrieval method in Section 3.2.  \n13412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n  \n \n3.1 Locality -Sensitive Hashing  \nLocality -Sensitive Hashing  (LSH)  is a hashing scheme for \nprobabilistic search es of  large -scale high-dimension al data, \nrather than a specific algo rithm . It includes the  hashing  me-\nthod for Hamming  distance  using bit sampling  [6], the me-\nthod for Jaccard distance using min -wise independent pe r-\nmutation  [12], the method based on random projection  for \ncosine distance  [13], and the method using p -stable di stri-\nbution  for Lp distance  [14]. The concept of LSH is to map \nthe high-dimension al vector data into hash values  so that \nsimilar data are mapped to the same hash values with high \nprobability . Gener ally, we cannot find a hash function \nwhich gives the same hash values for similar hi gh-\ndimensional data. LSH  can maintain certain retrieval acc u-\nracy by using multiple hash functions.  \n    There are a few Locality -Sensitive Hashing  schemes \nproposed to reduce the problem in the Hamming space. In-\ndyk and Motwani propo sed an  LSH algorithm for Ha m-\nming space based on the Point Location in Equal Balls  \n(PLEB)  problem  [15], and Charikar [13] and Ravicha ndran \n[16] improv ed the algorithm by u sing random permutation s \nof binary  vectors . \n    The concept of random permutation s is as follows : given \na set of n vectors D = {d1, d2, ‚Ä¶, dn}, where each vector \nconsists  of k binary bits, permutation    is defined as a bije c-\ntion on {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, k}, and then  we can define that the bit \nvector                      is a permutation of            . \nThe number of permutation s for k bits is k!, hence  a random \npermutation is a random selection from these k! permut a-\ntions. \n   We can now create the data set     by permut ing all bits \nby using    for all elemen ts in the  data set D, and also calc u-\nlate the new query vector     from the query vector q in the \nsame way . The most similar vector to     can be found  in \nthe data set    by doing the following  steps : Sort    in lex-\nicographic order,  and then perform the binary search . The \nbinary search is carried out from the first bit to the last bit , \nso if a different bit is located in the upper side (near the first \nbit), then the search makes a mistake. On the other hand, if \na different bit is located in the lower side, the search c an \nfind the nearest vector. We expect to find the most similar \nvector by making a number of random permutations    \nand corresponding data set    , and searching for all data \nsets. This is an overview of the LSH for Hamming space \nproposed by Charikar [13] an d Ravicha ndran [16] ; the de-\ntails of the theories and experimental analysis  of this m e-\nthod are discus sed in [13] and  [17]. \n3.2 Fast Hamming Space  Search  Method for Audio \nFingerprints  \nThe principle of the Hamming space search based on ra n-dom permutation s is simple. The binary search can certai n-\nly find the exact vector if there exists one vector the same \nas the query.  A similar vector which has a few differen t bits \nin the lower side can be found, too , but the problem  is that \nsometimes it cannot find a simi lar v ector which has a few \ndifferent  bits in the upper side. To address  this problem,  \nrandom permutations are used. In general, LSH -based m e-\nthods use multiple hash functions . In the Hamming space \nsearch based on the random permutation  method, multiple \nrandom permutations can be regarded as multiple hash \nfunctions .  \n   The greatest disadvantage of the retrieval method based \non random permutation s is the require ment for a huge \namount of memory  in order to perform  many random pe r-\nmutations on the original database in advance.  This i n-\ncreases the size of  database required to at least several to \nseveral dozen times  larger than the size  of the original  data-\nbase.  \nIf we c ould only multiplex the quer y vectors without \nmultiplexing the database vectors , then Hamming space \nsearch ing would require little memory . Based on  this a s-\nsumption, w e propose  a new search method by modifying  \nthe query vector into many  similar vector s. \n     The scheme of the search method based on random pe r-\nmutation s is shown in Figure 1, and that of the proposed \nmethod is  shown in Figure 2.  In the random  permutation \nmethod, m ultiple random permutations  (  ,           in \nFigure 1) are applied to b oth the original data base and \nquery  vector  in order to solve the problem  of search omi s-\nsions . On the other hand, in the proposed method, only the \nquery is multiplexed  through  the functions (   ,           \nin Fig ure 2). The definition of functions    is necessarily \napplication -dependent.  \n    The proposed method  is based on the sub-fingerprint \nmatching  scheme , and functions    create the multiplexed \nsearch queries of sub -fingerprint s equences from the query \naudio clip . Many sub -fingerprints are extracted  by shifting \nthe query  into frame s. Moreover, there exists a great sim i-\nlarity  between the overlapping sub -fingerprints in the s e-\nquence of sub -fingerprint , so that m ultiplexed  sub-\nfingerprints with slight differences can be obtained as star t-\ning time of frame moving down . These sub -fingerprints  are \nused for queries  multiplexing , whic h make it possible to \nsearch for a song without modifying the original database \nby using random permutations . \n   The flow of the proposed method is as follows: first, es-\ntimate  several candidate s of starting position  in the database \nthose  using sub -fingerprint s obtain ed from the query.  Then , \ncalculate the Hamming distance (bit error rate)  for the fin-\ngerprint block s of query mu sic data and estimated cand i-\ndates . Usually one sub -fingerprint does not contain suff i-\ncient information for music identification, so a sequence of   \n135Poster Session 1\n  \n \n \n     \nFigure 1.

In this paper, the length of \nthe SSF is set to 3 ( 3 sub -fingerprints, containing  96 bits in \ntotal).  \nA schematic diagram of the SSF search is shown in \nFigure 3. The sub-fingerprint s obtained from all the songs \nof the database are denoted by FP = (FP 1, FP 2, ‚Ä¶, FP n). \nAs stated above, we can get many SSFs  in certain length by \nchanging the starting position of  fingerprint . Let m be the \nlength of each SSF, and the SSFs are constructed  from \n   in such a  way that SSF 1 = (FP1, FP 2,‚Ä¶, FP m), SSF 2 = \n(FP 2, FP 3,‚Ä¶, FP m+1) and the i-th sub-fingerprint sequence \nSSF i = (FP i, FP i+1,‚Ä¶, FP i+m-1).  All the SSFs are sorted by \nvalue and the sorted position s of SSFs are stored in a one -\ndimension al array S = S1, S2, ‚Ä¶, Sn-m+1. Array S, similar to \nthe suffix array  [18],  contains the indexes to    and satis-         \nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of SSF search  \n \nfies the following : \nSj = i    iff    SSF i = (FP i, FP i+1,‚Ä¶, FP i+m-1)  is the     \n   j-th SSF in sorted o rder.                      (4) \n \nIn the search step, a binary search is performed on array  \nS for all the SSFs extracted from the query  audio clip . Most \nsimilar SSF can be found by checking the neighborhood \npositions of the searched block in array S. \nArray  S is used as  an index for music retrieval. The size \nof the i ndex is proportion al to the length of the sub-\nfingerprint  sequence  in the database , so it requires much \nless memory/storage compared with the method based on \nrandom  permutation s. \nThe proposed method can be summarized as follows:  \n(1) Extract the sub-fingerprint  sequenc e FP from query \nmusic . \n(2) For all SSFs, find candidate positions by performing a \nbinary search on array S. \n(3) Set the start position of the FP to the candidate pos i-\ntion, and calculate the Hamming distance (bit error \nrate) between FP and the fingerprint  block corre s-\nponding to the SSF.  \n(4) Output the top n songs as the final result s. \n \n4.

Results on evaluation data  \n \nMusic clips uploaded to YouTube  were used for the \nqueries. Audio data were  extracted from various types  of \nvideo s, such as promotional video and live video. Many of \nthe music data were of poor quality , including music fo l-\nlowing and followed by long silences, and music with var i-\nous types  of noise such as hand -clapping, cries of excit e-\nment, and other environmental noise . 268 songs were used \nfor evaluation  data, which  are roughly classified by hand.  \nDetails of the evaluation data  are shown  in Table 1.  \n4.2 Acoustical Analysis Settings  \nAfter down -sampling to 4,000 Hz, the music data were  \nsegmented into frames by using a Hamming window. The  \nframe length was set to 1.024 seconds and the frame shift to  \n32 milliseconds. All frames were converted into the fr e-\nquency  domain by FFT. The frequency doma in was divided  \ninto 33 frequency bands, and 32 -bit sub -fingerprint features  \nwere extracted. The length of the fingerprint block was set  \nto 128.  \nAlthough these settings seem rough c ompared with those \ngiven by Haitsma and Kalker [3], these parameters  were \ndetermined by many preliminary experiments  and the r e-\nsulting proposed  algorithm gave a high accuracy . The total \nnumber of sub-fingerprints  was about  70 million . \n \n4.3 Experimental Results  \nExperiments were  carried out  on a PC (DELL  Precision  \nM6500 ) with an Intel Core  i7 CPU (1.73  GHz) (8 cores)  \nand 4 GB of memory. Retrie val times varied  as the query \nmusic , and each song was retriev ed in approx imately 0.4 to \n0.6 second s. \n   The length of the sub-fingerprint  sequence for one query  \nmusic was approximately  from 6,000 to 8,000 fingerprints . \nThe proposed algorithm search es candidate positions by a \nbinary search for all SSFs  (length was 3) extracted  from the \nquery music before calculating the bit error rate of finge r-\nprint block s. Therefore, we believe that the algorithm is competent and fast since the retr ieval time per  SSF did not \nexceed 0.1 milliseconds . \n    The top-1 retrieval accuracy  is shown in the right column \nof Table 1 . The retrieval rate for ‚Äúoriginal music ‚Äù was \n98.6%, and accura cy for ‚Äúlive music‚Äù was 83.1%. The dif-\nference was due to the different melody of the live clip \nfrom that of the original music.  The evaluation data of \n‚Äúoriginal music ‚Äù can be divided into two classes with r e-\ngard to noise, but the results did not show any influence of \nnoise.  \n5. CONCLUTION S \nIn this paper , we have proposed  a fast  Hamming space \nsearch  method for audio fingerprinting  systems . Our me-\nthod is inspired by Locality -Sensitive Hashing (LSH) , a \nprobabilistic  algorithm for solving the n earest neighbor  \nsearch  in high-dimensional spaces . LSH  uses multiple hash \nfunctions to maintain high retrieval accuracy  and therefore \nrequires a large amount of memory/storage for saving hash \ntable s. For the Hamming space search, LSH must maintain \nmultiple database set s created by random permutations. On \nthe other hand, the proposed m ethod created multiplexed \nsearch quer ies of sub -fingerprint sequence  with different \nstarting time , and does not require expansion of the dat a-\nbase. As a result, a large amount of memory/stora ge is not \nneeded. Experimental results showed that the proposed m e-\nthod delivers accurate, fast retrieval.  \n6.

INTRODUCTION\nAutomatictaggingofmusicisapopulartopicinrecentyears ,\nwithapplicationsinmusicinformationretrieval,descrip tion\nof music, etc. The task is to associate a song with a few rel-\nevant labels (or tags), e.g. pop, male vocal and happy. We\nwant to predict conÔ¨Ådence values that accurately estimate\nthe strength of the association between the labels and audio\ncontents. Givenasong,theseconÔ¨Ådencevaluescanbeused\nto rank the tags by relevance, and this is the music anno-\ntation task. In the music retrieval task, we rank the songs\naccording totheirrelevance toa speciÔ¨Åc query tag.\nThe challenge mainly lies in two parts. One is how to\nrepresent a song or a song segment that best summarizes\nits content. The most popular audio feature is the Mel-\nFrequencyCepstralCoefÔ¨Åcient(MFCC)thatonlydescribes\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this w ork for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided th at copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and th at copies\nbear this noticeand thefull citation ontheÔ¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011International Society forMusic InformationRetrieval .a 23ms time window. While these very short ‚Äúframes‚Äù can-\nnot be used directly as features for songs, they make up\nthe building blocks for more advanced features. [7] sum-\nmarized the frame-level features over a segment by means\nand covariances and other features were combined by Ad-\naBoost. Spectral covariances over a segment were also pro-\nposed and achieved better results than means and covari-\nances of MFCC [6]. Other methods tried to estimate the\nprobability distribution of the MFCC feature space and use\nthis as song-level features [1,3]. At the same time, time se-\nries model [5] attempted to incorporate the temporal infor-\nmation but the complex structures in music are difÔ¨Åcult to\ncapture because of therichpatterns ofmultiple timescales .\nThe other difÔ¨Åculty is the multitude of the labels. The\nlarge number of tags and relatively few tags per song result\nin severe label imbalance, presenting a challenging prob-\nlem for most discriminative methods such SVM and Ad-\naBoost [7,13]. These methods tend to score high in classi-\nÔ¨Åcation by predicting most new test songs as negative sam-\nples. However, we found, with empirical evaluation, that\nlogistic regression appears to be more robust in such situa-\ntions in that it tries to maximize the conditional probabili ty\nrather than tominimize theclassiÔ¨Åcation errordirectly.\nCurrently, most state-of-the-art methods are probabilis-\ntic models. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) [3] approxi-\nmate the probability distribution of features conditioned on\neach tag with a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Then the\nBayesian rule is applied to calculate the posterior probabi l-\nity of a tag given a new song. One shortcoming of the gen-\nerative model is that it does not fully utilize the label info r-\nmation compared with discriminative methods. Recently, a\nmore ‚Äúdiscriminative-Ô¨Çavored‚Äù probabilistic model, Code -\nword Bernoulli Average (CBA) [1], was proposed and it\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on annotation and r e-\ntrieval tasks. Although CBA is efÔ¨Åcient and effective, the\nEM algorithm used in estimating its parameters only con-\nverges to a local optimum and as a result the learnt parame-\nterswilldepend on different initializations.\nWe propose to use regularized logistic regression to ad-\n711Poster Session 6\ndress the music tagging problem. First, song-level statist ics\nare summarized in the ‚Äúbag-of-words‚Äù of quantized delta\nMFCC features. Then, we apply logistic regression to learn\nthe correlations of tags and music content by exploiting the\nlabel information. Different regularization terms are inc or-\nporated in logistic regression to reduce overÔ¨Åtting and im-\nprove generalization. Our approach enjoys the beneÔ¨Åt of\nconvex optimization with global optimum guarantee. Also,\nby using Ô¨Årst-order methods, the proposed model can be\nlearnt in a short time and it scales linearly to large dataset .\nMoreover, experiments demonstrate that our regularized lo -\ngisticregressioncanachievestate-of-the-artperforman cein\nCAL-500 dataset [2].\n2. SONG-LEVEL FEATURE REPRESENTATION\nWechooseasimple‚Äúbag-of-words‚Äùrepresentation,thesame\nas in [1,11] and many other image classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms\n[10], as our song-level feature. This simple representatio n\nfacilitates efÔ¨Åcient and scalable prediction of musictags for\nalarge set ofdata.\nOur primary features are the 39 dimension delta MFCC\nfeaturesover23mstime-window. EachdeltaMFCCfeature\nis concatenated from one MFCC feature, its Ô¨Årst derivative\nand its second derivative. As a preprocessing step, we Ô¨Årst\nnormalize all the delta MFCC features to have zero mean\nand unit variance in each dimension. We then apply k-\nmeans to learn Kcluster centroids as ‚Äúaudio dictionary‚Äù\nD= [d1,d2,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,dK]‚ààRp√óKin the pdimensional fea-\nture space, where p= 39. The centroids act as ‚Äúrepresenta-\ntives‚Äù of typical audio frames.\nLet{vi,1,vi,2,¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,vi,Ni}denotethesetofdeltaMFCC\nvectors for song i. We count the number of feature vectors\nforsong ithatarenearesttodictionaryitem djinEuclidean\ndistance\nni,j=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/braceleftbigg\nk:j= arg min\nt/ba‚àádblvi,k‚àídt/ba‚àádbl2\n2/bracerightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle.(1)\nThe counts ni,jcan be considered as a discrete approx-\nimation to the probability distribution on the feature spac e.\nComparedwiththeparametricmodel[3],ournon-parametric\nrepresentation ismoreÔ¨Çexible and easier toimplement.\nWe then normalize the counts to cancel out the effect\nof varying song lengths. The frequency of the j-th ‚Äúaudio\nword‚Äù inthe i-thsong iscalculated as\nri,j=ni,j/summationtextK\nk=1ni,k. (2)\nFinally, the i-th song is represented as x(i)whose j-th\nelement is x(i)\nj=ri,j.\nThe most time consuming part of song-level feature rep-\nresentationisk-meansclustering. However,thisisdoneof f-\nline and can be speeded up by using a subset of samples orusing hierarchical clustering. When a new song arrives, we\njustneedtoassigneachofitsdeltaMFCCfeaturestooneof\nthecentroids andconstruct thehistogram,whosetimecom-\nplexity is linear inthenumber ofdelta MFCC features.\n3. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH\nREGULARIZATION\nGiven the ‚Äúbag-of-words‚Äù representation of each song, we\ntrain a linear classiÔ¨Åer to predict the labels. We choose lo-\ngistic regression because its loss function is less sensiti ve\nto noise and label imbalance compared with others, such as\nhinge lossinSVM or exponential lossinAdaBoost.\n3.1 Multi-label LogisticRegression\nIn the automatic music tagging problem, there are mla-\nbels/tags, and we want to learn a vector-valued prediction\nfunction f(x) = [f1(x),f2(x),¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑,fm(x)]T:X /mapsto‚Üí Y,\nwhere the input space Xis theKdimensional vector space\nof‚Äúbag-of-words‚Äùandthelabelspace Yis{1,‚àí1}m.

Compared with bi-\nnary classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, these two tasks are more closely\nrelated withreal scenarios.\nThemusicdatacomesfromCAL-500Dataset[2]. There\nare500Westernpolyphonicsongsandtheannotationswere\ncollected from more than three human subjects per song.\nWhen training the classiÔ¨Åer, we only use the binary anno-\ntations with {0,1}(transformed to {‚àí1,1}for learning) to\nindicate whether thetag isrelevant tothe song.\nWe are more interested in predicting more ‚Äúuseful‚Äù tags\nrather than very obscure ones. Following the same setting\nin [4,5], we only evaluate on the 78 tags that have at least\n50 examples and 97 toppopular tags.\n5.1 Annotation and Retrieval\nUsing similar experimental setting as in [4,5], we used 5-\nfold cross validation. In each round, we Ô¨Årst learned our\nmodelparameters B‚àó,c‚àówiththe400-songtrainingsetand\npredictedconÔ¨Ådenceratingsontheremaining100-songtest\nset. The conditional probability (conÔ¨Ådence rating) of a ta g\nbeing assigned to a song was then calculated using Eq. 4.\nTo compensate for non-uniform label prior, we adopted the\nsameheuristicusedin[1]byintroducinga‚Äúdiversityfacto r‚Äù\n713Poster Session 6\nModel Precision Recall F-score P3 P5 P10 MAP AROC\nCBA 0.361 0.212 0.267 0.463 0.458 0.440 0.425 0.691\nGMM 0.405 0.202 0.269 0.456 0.455 0.441 0.433 0.698\nContext-SVM 0.380 0.230 0.286 0.512 0.487 0.449 0.434 0.687\nDirMix 0.441 0.232 0.303 0.519 0.501 0.470 0.443 0.697\nLogRegr 0.396 0.196 0.262 0.407 0.428 0.424 0.404 0.671\nl1LogRegr 0.416 0.202 0.272 0.414 0.413 0.417 0.411 0.673\nl2LogRegr 0.446 0.227 0.301 0.515 0.512 0.485 0.459 0.719\nTable 1.

For each predicted conÔ¨Ådence rating, we sub-\ntracted dtimes the mean conÔ¨Ådence for that tag. We then\nassigned each song withthetop10 most conÔ¨Ådent tags.\nAnnotation was evaluated by mean precision and recall\nover the tags. Given the 10 annotations per song in the test\nset, we calculated precision and recall for each tag and then\naveraged across all considered tags. The Ô¨Ånal result was\naveraged over 5 rounds of cross validation. In addition, F-\nscore, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was com-\nputed tosummarize thetwoaspects of precisionand recall.\nFor retrieval, we Ô¨Årst ranked the songs in the descend-\ning order according to conÔ¨Ådence ratings for a speciÔ¨Åc tag.\nBetter retrieval result corresponds to cases that more rele -\nvant songs appear at the top of the ranking list. Then, we\ncalculated precision at every position down the ranking lis t\nvia dividing the number of true positives found so far by\nthe total number of songs so far. Evaluation was conducted\nthroughaveragedprecisionand precisionat k(k= 3,5,10)\nas in [4].

For the 97 tags setting, we compare\nwith CBA [1], GMM [3], Context-SVM [12] and Dirich-\nlet Mixtures (DirMix) [4]. Their results were originally re -\nported in [4] and are copied in Table 1 for more convenient\ncomparison. Forthe78tagssetting,CBA,HEM-GMM(the\nsame as GMM) and HEM-DTM [5] were compared. Their\noriginal resultsreported in[5]and copied inTable 2.\nTheresultsofourthreevariantsoflogisticregressionun-\nder the 97 tags setting are also reported in Table 1. All our\nmethods were based on K= 2000dictionary size ‚Äúbag-\nof-words‚Äù representation, with the cluster centroids trai ned\non a random subset of 100,000 samples from all the delta\nMFCCfeaturesprovidedinthedataset. Non-regularizedlo-\ngistic regression was equivalent to setting Œª= 0. The pa-\nrameter Œªin the two regularized algorithms were set to the\noptimum. For l1logistic regression, it was set to 0.001 and\nforl2logisticregression, it was setto0.01.\nFrom Table 1, we can see that non-regularized logistic\nregression performed the worst but still had reasonable re-\nsults.l1regularizationimprovedtheperformanceby0.01or\n0.02forsomemeasures. l2regularizationintroducedgreater\nimprovement over the l1regularized variant, achieving best\nperformance in retrieval even than the state-of-the-art. A nd\nitwascomparablewiththeDirichletMixturemodelinanno-\ntation task. Note that theDirichlet Mixture model exploite d\nthe label correlations explicitly while our method incorpo -\nrated nosuch schemes toutilizecontext information.\nFor the 78 tags case illustrated in Table 2, the simple lo-\ngistic regression performed better than CBA in the annota-\ntion task. l1regularization consistently improved the per-\nformance by 0.01 for most measures. Again, l2regular-\nized logistic regression outperformed other approaches in\n71412th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nall measures except for precision. However, by comparing\nthe F-score which summarizes the overall annotation score,\nall three variants performed better than or on par with the\nstate-of-the-art. Considering thefact that HEM-DTM bene-\nÔ¨Åted from information over the 23ms time window, our al-\ngorithms‚Äô performance areeven moreencouraging.\nThe performance of non-regularized logistic regression\nwas limited because of the overÔ¨Åtting effect. l1regulariza-\ntionslightlyimprovedthesituationbyconstrainingtheco m-\nplexityoftheparameters. However,itappearsthatthe‚Äúbag -\nof-words‚Äù representation does not have the hidden sparse\nstructurewhich l1normregularizationcanhelpreveal. Rather,\nthe classiÔ¨Åer coefÔ¨Åcients should be dense to fully take into\naccount all the details in the distribution. The l2norm was\nthussuitableforsuchsituationwhereitconstrainedthemo del\ncomplexity ingeneral and produced non-zero coefÔ¨Åcients.\n5.2.2 Effect of Changing Dictionary Size K\nWe also explored the effect of different dictionary sizes K.\nIntheexperiments,weran l2regularizedlogisticregression\nwithŒªset to 0.01 and under different K(10, 20, 50, 100,\n200, 500, 800, 1000, 2000 and 5000). Fig. 1 illustrates the\nperformance on the two tag number settings for annotation\nand retrieval tasks.\nFrom Fig. 1, we can see that as Kincreases, the algo-\nrithmbeneÔ¨Åtsfrommoreaccurateapproximationtothedis-\ntribution and achieves better performance. The biggest im-\nprovement occurs from 10 to 100 dictionary sizes. It ap-\npearsthatwhen Kincreasesoverthisrange,themajorstruc-\nture in the distribution has been captured by the ‚Äúbag-of-\nwords‚Äùrepresentation. AswegoontomodeltheÔ¨Ånerscales\nwith even larger K, the performance continues to climb up\nuntil it gradually levels off when Kexceeds 2000. From\nK= 2000toK= 5000, the improvement is less than 0.01\nfor retrieval while the computational cost is multiplied by\n2.5 times. Therefore, we choose K= 2000as our optimal\ndictionary sizeintheCAL-500 dataset.\n5.2.3 Effect of Different Regularization Parameter Œª\nThe regularization parameter Œªaffects the performance by\nbalancing the loss function and the regularization. Smalle r\nŒªleads to more focus on the empirical error while larger Œª\nplaces more priorityon keeping the model complexity low.\nWevaried Œªfrom10‚àí5to10withequalstepsizeinloga-\nrithmscalefor l2regularized logisticregressionunder K=\n2000. The effect is demonstrated in Fig. 2. For l2regular-\nized logistic regression, the optimal Œªis 0.01. And we can\nsee that the algorithm is relatively robust to the parameter\nchangefrom 10‚àí4to10‚àí1.

INTRODUCTION\nChord progression analysis is an important task for content-\nbased music information retrieval (MIR) [1,2]. Because the\nchord patterns used in musical pieces are closely related to\nthe composer styles [3] and musical genres [4], it is usefulto build statistical models of chord patterns from symbolic\nchord sequences. In addition, accurate models of chord se-\nquences (called language models in analogy with automatic\nspeech recognition) could improve the accuracy of auto-\nmatic chord recognition for music audio signals [5, 6].\nSo far,n-gram models have often been used as language\nmodels of chord sequences [2‚Äì6]. An n-gram is a subse-\nquence of nchords in a given chord sequence, and n-gram\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted w ithout fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or c ommercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.F:maj G:7 C:majG:7 C:majC:maj1-gram probability\n2-gram probability\n3-gram probabilityP(C:maj| œÜ)\nP(C:maj|G:7)\nP(C:maj|F:maj G:7)0-gram probability (base measure)\nP(C:maj)Bayesian\nsmoothing\nContext Next chordBayesian\nsmoothing\nBayesian\nsmoothing\nFigure 1 . A hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian model for\naccurately smoothing n-gram probabilities.\nmodels are based on ( n‚àí1)-order Markovian assumption be-\ncause chords exhibit strong short-term dependency. In other\nwords, each chord in a given sequence is assumed to de-\npend on its n‚àí1previous chords called a context .U s i n g\na limited amount of observed data, the goal is to make a\nstatistical model that can calculate the predictive probability\nof a next chord ( n-gram probability), given any context of\nlengthn‚àí1. However, the observed n-grams are generally a\nlimited subset of all kinds of n-grams, and the number of all\nkinds ofn-grams increases exponentially with increasing n.\nTherefore, the naive estimates of the probabilities of unob-servedn-grams are zero. To avoid such overÔ¨Åtting, various\nheuristic smoothing methods have been developed [7].\nIn this paper we focus on three fundamental limitations\nof conventional n-gram models: 1) n-gram models based on\nheuristic smoothing methods have no solid theoretical foun-\ndation, 2) the value of nshould be speciÔ¨Åed uniquely in ad-\nvance even though each chord depends on a variable-length\ncontext, 3) A limited set of chord labels (e.g., major, minor,\naugmented, diminished, seventh, ¬∑¬∑¬∑, and their derivations)\nshould be deÔ¨Åned as a vocabulary in advance. Especially,\nthe last limitation has not been discussed so far.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-\nfree inÔ¨Ånity-gram model by extending modern nonparamet-\nric Bayesian n-gram models [8‚Äì10]. Our model is formu-\nlated in a hierarchical Bayesian manner (Figure 1) and has\nthe following merits: 1) The predictive distribution of a next\nchord can be naturally formalized by providing the proba-\nbilistic generative model of chord sequences. 2) Each chord\nin a sequence is allowed to have an unbounded and variable-length context. A posterior distribution of the context length\n645Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\ncan be estimated. 3) Any combinations of notes can be ac-\ncepted as chord types. A chord vocabulary is incrementally\nexpanded as needed. These metits enable our model to not\nonly attain the best performance but also Ô¨Ånd ‚Äústochastically-\ncoherent‚Äù variable-length chord patterns that are not always\nsimply the ones used most frequently (cf. [11]).\nThe innovative models of symbolic chord sequences (an\ninÔ¨Ånity-gram model and its vocabulary-free extension) are\nuseful for probabilistic modeling of music audio signals. A\ntypical application is automatic chord recognition, where a\nvocabulary of chord labels is given. For example, an inÔ¨Ånity-\ngram model could be fused with a joint probabilistic model\nof keys, chords, and bass notes [12]. Another novel applica-\ntion is automatic music transcription, where a vocabulary isnotgiven. We plan to use a vocabulary-free model as a prior\ndistribution on a probabilistic acoustic model for multipitch\nestimation [13], and jointly optimize the both models. This\nmeans that chords and their progressions (now ‚Äúchords‚Äù are\ncombinations of notes, not text labels) are self-organized in\nan unsupervised manner and are used as a constraint on si-\nmultaneous and temporal pitch distributions.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2\ndescribes the chord notations used in this study. Section 3\nintroduces related work on nonparametric Bayesian n-gram\nmodels and Section 4 explains our model. Section 5 reports\nour experiments and Section 6 concludes this paper.\n2. CHORD NOTATIONS\nWe introduce label-based and component-based notations to\nrepresent chord sequences (Table 1).\n2.1 Label-based Notation\nThe conventional label-based notation is based on intuitive\nshorthand labels deÔ¨Åned by Harte et al. [14]. There are 17\nchord labels with an attached root note, which is one of 12pitch classes.\n1In this paper we do not distinguish C# from\nDb because they are in the same pitch class. This is a stan-\ndard treatment used in [2, 3]. For example, C major and\nGb diminished seventh chords are respectively represented\nas C:maj and F#:dim7. The symbol ‚ÄúN‚Äù is used to indicate\n‚Äúno chord‚Äù (e.g., silence or untuned sounds). The resulting\nvocabulary size is 205 ( 17√ó1 2+1 ).\n2.2 Component-based Notation\nThe component-based notation is based on degrees of note\ncomponents (relative displacements against a root note). Each\nchord is represented as a combination of a root note and a\n12-dimensional binary vector whose elements indicate the\nexistences of the corresponding degrees. For example, C\nmajor chords are written as C:100010010000 and D major\nchords as D:100010010000, not as D:001000100100. Note\nthat any combinations of notes can be represented even if\n1The pitch classes are deÔ¨Åned as 12 different scales within an octave,\ni.e.,{C ,C # ,D ,D # ,E ,F ,F # ,G ,G # ,A ,A # ,B }.\nChord type\n Label Components\nMajor\n maj 100010010000\nMinor\n min 100100010000\nDiminished\n dim 100100100000\nAugmented\n aug 100010001000\nMajor Seventh\n maj7 100010010001\nMinor Seventh\n min7 100100010010\nSeventh\n 7 100010010010\nDim.

Shorthand labels and pitch-class components\nthey are not deÔ¨Åned in Table 1. For example, C major chords\nwith an added fourth are written as C:100011010000. Such\ninformation is available in Harte‚Äôs chord annotations [14].\nWith the additional symbol ‚ÄúN‚Äù, the resulting vocabularysize is 49153 ( 2\n12√ó12 + 1 ). This is Ô¨Ånite because we fo-\ncus on note existences in individual pitch classes. Note that\na truly vocabulary-free (inÔ¨Ånite-vocabulary) notation can be\ndeÔ¨Åned by focusing on note counts based on musical scores,\ni.e., by representing note components of each chord as a 12-\ndimensional nonnegative-integer vector.\n3. PROBABILISTIC LANGUAGE MODELS\nThis section introduces related work on n-gram models. We\nÔ¨Årst identify the purpose of n-gram modeling and then ex-\nplain several state-of-the-art models based on the probability\ntheory of Bayesian nonparametrics.\n3.1 Problem SpeciÔ¨Åcation\nSuppose we have a chord vocabulary Ww h o s es i z ei s V\n(in this paper, 205 or 49153). Let w‚ààWbe a chord and\nu‚ààWn‚àí1,w h e r encan be anypositive integer, be a con-\ntext consisting of a sequence of n‚àí1chords. We have a\nlimited amount of observed data X, which is a sequence of\nMchords,x1x2¬∑¬∑¬∑xM,w h e r exm‚ààW(1‚â§m‚â§M).\nWe assume for simplicity that we have only one chord se-\nquence. In n-gram modeling, each chord xmis assumed to\ndepend on the past n‚àí1chords (context).\nGiven observed data X, the goal is to estimate Pu(w|X),\ni.e., the predictive probability of chord wfollowing context\nu.L e tcuwbe the number of occurrences of chord wfol-\nlowing context uin training data X. The naive maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimate is given by\nPML\nu(w|X)=cuw\ncu¬∑(1)\nwhere the dot ( ¬∑) means the sum over that index, i.e., cu¬∑=/summationtext\nw/primecuw/prime.H o w e v e r , i f n-gramuwis not observed in X\n64612th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\n(cuw=0), its probability is estimated to be zero. This is\ncalled the zero-probability problem.\nTo solve this problem various smoothing methods have\nbeen proposed. The family of Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing\nis empirically known as one of the most accurate smoothing\ntechniques [7]. A method called interpolated KN (IKN) es-\ntimatesPu(w|X)by discounting the actual count cuwby\na Ô¨Åxed amount d|u|depending on the context length |u|\nifcuw>0(otherwise the count remains 0). Furthermore,\nthe discounted n-gram probability of chord wis interpo-\nlated with the ( n‚àí1)-gram probability of chord w. Another\nimportant variant is called modiÔ¨Åed KN (MKN), where the\namount of discount is allowed to vary according to the value\nofcuw. MKN is known to slightly outperform IKN.\n3.2 Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Language Model\nTeh [8] proposed a nonparametric Bayesian n-gram model\ncalled a hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model (HPYLM).\nInterestingly, IKN was proven to be a deterministic approx-\nimation of the HPYLM, which can be optimized in a princi-\npled way and performs better than IKN.\n3.2.1 Pitman-Yor Process and Hierarchical Formulation\nWe brieÔ¨Çy explain the Pitman-Yor process (PY) [15], which\nis a building block of nonparametric Bayesian models. The\nPY is a distribution over distributions (e.g., n-gram distribu-\ntions) over a sample space (e.g., vocabulary W). Letdand\nŒ∏be positive real numbers and G0be a distribution over a\nsample space. The PY is written as\nG‚àºPY(d,Œ∏,G 0) (2)\nwheredis called a discount parameter, Œ∏a strength parame-\nter, andG0a base measure. Gis a random distribution over\nthe sample space. When the value of Œ∏becomes larger, Gis\nmore likely to be similar to G0.\nThe HPYLM is formulated by layering PYs in a hierar-\nchical Bayesian manner. Suppose we have a unigram distri-butionG\nœÜoverW,w h e r eœÜis the empty context and GœÜ(w)\nis the unigram probability of chord w. A bigram distribution\nGugiven the last chord udiffers from but is somewhat sim-\nilar toGœÜ.H e r eGuis assumed to be drawn from a PY with\nbase measure GœÜasGu‚àºPY(d1,Œ∏1,GœÜ),w h e r ed1andŒ∏1\nare discount and strength parameters that are shared among\ncontexts of length 1. Generally speaking, an n-gram distri-\nbutionGugiven a context uof length n‚àí1is drawn from a\nPY with base measure GœÄ(u)as follows:\nGu‚àºPY(d|u|,Œ∏|u|,GœÄ(u)) (3)\nwhereœÄ(u)is a shortened context obtained by removing\nthe earliest chord from u,a n dd|u|andŒ∏|u|are discount and\nstrength parameters depending on the length |u|. Since the\n(n‚àí1)-gram distribution GœÄ(u)is unknown, a PY prior with\nparameters d|œÄ(u)|andŒ∏|œÄ(u)|and base measure GœÄ(œÄ(u))\nis recursively put on GœÄ(u). Finally, the unigram distribu-\ntionGœÜis given by GœÜ‚àºPY(d0,Œ∏0,G0)whereG0is aF:maj\nC:maj D:minC:majDepth 0\nDepth 1\nDepth 2Original customer\nOriginal customer \nwho sends a proxy\nProxy customer\nProxy customer \nwho sends a proxy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Back-track\nthe context\nSend \na proxy\nSend \na proxyœÜ\n‚Ä¶\nFigure 2 . Hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model.\nglobal base measure (0-gram distribution), which is usually\nassumed to be uniform, i.e., G0(w)=1/V.\nConsequently, the hierarchical structure of the HPYLM\ncan be represented as a sufÔ¨Åx tree of depth n‚àí1,a ss h o w ni n\nFigure 2 where the case of n=3is illustrated. Each node is\nidentiÔ¨Åed as a context, i.e., descending the tree from the root\nnode to the target node means back-tracking the context.\n3.2.2 Stochastic Process for Data Generation\nOnce the HPYLM is deÔ¨Åned, observed data Xis generated\naccording to a stochastic process called the Chinese restau-\nrant franchise (CRF), which can be explained by using a\nmetaphor in which contexts are likened to restaurants ,M\nobserved variables in Xare likened to customers ,a n dV\nchord types in Ware likened to dishes . Each restaurant is\nallowed to have an unbounded number of tables and each ta-\nble is served a dish. Each customer enters a restaurant, sits\nat a table, and eats a dish served at that table.\nWe suppose that x1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,xMare generated sequentially,\nand consider how the m-th customer xmbehaves, given a\nseating arrangement of the past customers {x1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,xm‚àí1}.\nThe customer xmenters restaurant u=xm‚àí(n‚àí1)¬∑¬∑¬∑xm‚àí1\nof depthn‚àí1.L e ttuwbe the number of tables serving dish\nwin restaurant u.T h e r ea r e tu¬∑tables in total. Let cuwkbe\nthe number of customers sitting at table kand eating dish w\n(cuwk=0if tablekdoes not serve dish w). The customer\nxmthen sits (i) at an existing table k(1‚â§k‚â§tu¬∑)and eats\nad i s hwserved at the table with probability proportional to\ncuwk‚àíd|u|or (ii) at a new table k=tu¬∑+1with probability\nproportional to d|u|tu¬∑+Œ∏|u|. In the case (i), the value of xm\nis set towandcuwkis incremented. In the case (ii), to order\na dish served at the new table k, a proxy customer is sent to\nthe parent restaurant œÄ(u), where he behaves in a recursive\nmanner. If he eventually eats a dish win restaurant œÄ(u),\nthe dishwis also served at the new table kin restaurant u\nand the customer xmeats the dish w. Consequently, tuwis\nincremented, the value of xmis set tow,a n dcuwkis incre-\nmented. Note that when the proxy customer sits at a new\ntable in restaurant œÄ(u), a new proxy customer is further\nsent to the restaurant œÄ(œÄ(u)). Finally, a proxy customer\nmay be sent to the root restaurant œÜ.W h e nh es i t sa tan e w\ntable in the root restaurant œÜ, a dish served at the new table\nis chosen according to the global base measure G0.\n647Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nMore speciÔ¨Åcally, given a particular seating arrangement\n(denoted by S), a next chord wfollowing context uis gen-\nerated according to the following predictive distribution:\nPHPY\nu(w|S)=cuw¬∑‚àíd|u|tuw\ncu¬∑¬∑+Œ∏|u|+d|u|tu¬∑+Œ∏|u|\ncu¬∑¬∑+Œ∏|u|PHPY\nœÄ(u)(w|S)(4)\nwhere Eqn. (4) is a recursive deÔ¨Ånition with respect to con-\ntextuof any length, e.g., PHPY\nœÄ(u)(w|S)is given by substi-\ntutingœÄ(u)intouin Eqn. (4). Starting with an empty tree\n(cuwk=0 andtuw=0), a seating arrangement for Xis\nobtained by adding Mcustomers one by one. The IKN was\nfound to be an approximation of the HPYLM (the HPYLM\nreduces to the IKN when Œ∏|u|=0andtuw=1).\n3.2.3 Predictive Distribution and Bayesian Inference\nThe goal is to estimate the predictive distribution Pu(w|X)\nin a Bayesian manner. Since a true seating arrangement for\nXis unknown, the expected value of PHPY\nu(w|S)is calcu-\nlated under the CRF P(S|X)as follows:\nPHPY\nu(w|X)=/summationdisplay\nSPHPY\nu(w|S)P(S|X) (5)\nBecause this sum is analytically intractable, Gibbs sampling\nis used for approximation. More speciÔ¨Åcally, we get\nPHPY\nu(w|X)‚âà1\nLL/summationdisplay\nl=1PHPY\nu(w|Sl) (6)\nwhereLis the number of many i.i.d. seating arrangements\nsampled from p(S|X)andlis a sample index.\nThe Gibbs sampling algorithm is shown in Figure 3. First,\na seating arrangement is initialized by adding all customers\none by one according to the posterior CRF, where each cus-\ntomerxm=wsits at an existing or new table serving dish w\nwith probability given by the Ô¨Årst or second term of Eqn. (4).\nThen a customer xmis selected randomly and removed from\nthe tree, from which the related proxy customers and tables\nthat become empty are also removed. Given a seating ar-\nrangement of the other customers, the customer xmis added\nto the tree again according to the posterior CRF. By iterat-\ning this operation, Lseating arrangements are sampled with\na certain interval. Since the parameters d0,¬∑¬∑¬∑,dn‚àí1and\nŒ∏0,¬∑¬∑¬∑,Œ∏n‚àí1are unknown, beta and gamma prior distribu-\ntions are put on them and the values of the parameters are\nsampled from posterior distributions (see details in [8]).\n3.3 Variable-Order Pitman-Yor Language Model\nA problem of the HPYLM is that all Mcustomers are forced\nto enter restaurants of Ô¨Åxed depth n‚àí1. To solve the prob-\nlem, Mochihashi and Sumita [9] proposed a variable-order\nPY language model (VPYLM) that allows each customer to\nenter a restaurant of variable depth. Each chord xmis asso-\nciated with a latent variable zmthat indicates the value of n\n(depth +1). Since a true value of zmis unknown, all possi-\nble values of zmare considered ( nis marginalized out) for\nmaking predictions, resulting in the inÔ¨Ånity -gram model.for  m = 1 :Min random  order\nAdd customer         to the tree at depth  n-1mx\nfor  i= 1 :‚àû\nfor  m = 1 :Min random  order\nRemo ve customer          f rom  the tree\nAdd customer          to the tree at depth  n-1mx\nmxCreate  an empty  tree\nFigure 3 .

To solve this prob-\nlem in the context of word sequence modeling, Mochihashi\net al. [10] proposed a nested PY language model (NPYLM)\nby formulating a global base measure G0over a countably\n64812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\ninÔ¨Ånite number of variable-length words. Note that the con-\nventional base measure G0(w)=1/Vcannot be used be-\ncauseG0(w)‚Üí0whenV‚Üí‚àû . Instead, a spelling model\nbased on a letter-level VPYLM is given as a global base\nmeasureG0of aword-level VPYLM. More speciÔ¨Åcally, each\nword is regarded as a sequence of letters, which are assumed\nto follow a letter-level CRF. The word length (the numberof letters) is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. Thus,\nthe0-gram probability of any word w,G\n0(w),i sg i v e nb y\nthe product of the probabilities of the letters and their num-\nber, resulting in the inÔ¨Ånite -vocabulary model.\n4. VOCABULARY-FREE INFINITY-GRAM MODEL\nForchord sequence modeling we propose a novel vocabulary-\nfree inÔ¨Ånity-gram model similar in spirit to the NPYLM.\n4.1 Mathematical Formulation\nA critical problem is that we cannot apply the NPYLM to\nchord sequence modeling. Because words are temporal se-\nquences of letters and chords are simultaneous combinationsof notes, we need a different base measure G\n0.\nTo solve this problem, we formulate a probabilistic model\nbased on the component-based notation (Section 2.2) as a\nglobal base measure G0of a chord-level VPYLM. The base\nmeasureG0is based on a conjugate model. In general, a\nchordwcan be written as w0:w1¬∑¬∑¬∑w12,w h e r ew0is a\nroot note and the other variables take binary values. When\nw=N,w0=N and other variables are not used. We assume\nw0to follow a 13-dimensional discrete distribution and the\nothers to follow Bernoulli distributions as follows:\nG0(w)=p(w|œÄ,œÑ)=œÄw012/productdisplay\ni=1œÑwi\ni(1‚àíœÑi)1‚àíwi(11)\nwhereœÄ={œÄC,œÄC#,¬∑¬∑¬∑,œÄB,œÄN}indicates the probabilities\nof the respective pitch classes and ‚ÄúN‚Äù and œÑ={œÑ1,¬∑¬∑¬∑,œÑ12}\nindicates the existence probabilities of the respective de-\ngrees. Ifw=N,G0(w)=œÄN. Since the values of œÄandœÑ\nare unknown, we put prior distributions as follows:\np(œÄ,œÑ)=Dir(œÄ|a0)12/productdisplay\ni=1Beta(œÑi|b0,c0) (12)\nwherea0,b0,a n dc0are hyperparameters (set to 0.5).\n4.2 Bayesian Inference\nGiven a seating arrangement S, the posterior distribution of\nœÄandœÑcan be easily calculated as follows:\np(œÄ,œÑ|S)=Dir(œÄ|a0+n)12/productdisplay\ni=1Beta(œÑi|b0+ni,c0+¬Øni)(13)\nwherenv(vis one of the pitch classes or ‚ÄúN‚Äù) is the number\nof tables serving dishes with root note v(w0=v) in the root\nrestaurant œÜ,niis the number of tables serving dishes with\nthei-th note ( wi=1)i nœÜ,a n d ¬Øniis the number of tables\nserving dishes without the i-th note (wi=0)i nœÜ.The predictive distribution of a next chord wcan be cal-\nculated in the same way as the VPYLM (Section 3.3.2). The\nGibbs sampling algorithm of the VPYLM is modiÔ¨Åed as fol-\nlows: When a (proxy) customer sits at a new table (a new\ntable is added) in the root restaurant œÜ, the values of nvand\nnior¬Øniare incremented according to the components of the\ntarget chord (a dish served at that table). When a table is re-moved from the root restaurant œÜ, the values of n\nvandni\nor¬Øniare decremented. The values of œÄandœÑare sampled\nfrom the posterior distribution given by Eqn. (13).\n5. EXPERIMENTS\nThis section reports our comparative experiments.\n5.1 Experimental Conditions\nWe used a standard dataset of chord sequences for 180 Bea-\ntles songs collected from 12 albums (13 CDs) [14]. Be-\ncause the choice of chords depends on the musical key, we\nselected 137 major-scale non-transposition songs and trans-\nposed them to C major. The total number of chords was\n10,761, where 103 chord types were observed in the label-based notation (the vocabulary size was 205) and 149 chord\ntypes were observed in the component-based notation (the\nvocabulary size was 49153). The entropies of both data were\n3.79 [bits] and 3.92 [bits], respectively.\nIn the Ô¨Årst experiment using the label-based notation, the\neffectiveness of inÔ¨Ånity-gram modeling was evaluated by\ncomparing six existing methods: Good-Turing (GT), Witten-Bell (WB), IKN, MKN, HPYLM, and VPYLM, where GT\nand WB are classical smoothing methods [7]. In the second\nexperiment using the component-based notation, the effec-\ntiveness of vocabulary-free modeling was evaluated. In ad-\ndition to the existing methods, we tested our models that in-\ncorporate the vocabulary-free base measure G\n0into HPYLM\nand VPYLM (denoted by preÔ¨Åx ‚ÄúVF-‚Äù). To evaluate the pre-dictive performance, we conducted 10-fold cross validation\nand measured perplexity , which indicates the average num-\nber of next-chord candidates (a degree of uncertainty), given\na context. A lower perplexity means better performance.\n5.2 Experimental Results\nWe found in the Ô¨Årst experiment that VPYLM yielded the\nlowest perplexity (Table 2) and that, as shown in Figure 4,\na posterior distribution over ncan be estimated for each\nchord. To obtain better predictive performance, it is impor-\ntant to marginalize out n(take all possibilities into account)\nrather than use a maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate of\nn. The training time and memory usage of the VPYLM were\ntwo times shorter and Ô¨Åve times smaller than those of the 10-\ngram HPYLM because unnecessarily-longer contexts (deep\nnodes) do not need to be considered (expanded). We could\ndiscover stochastically-coherent chord patterns (Table 3) by\ncalculating P\nu(w,n|X)=/summationtext\nSPu(w,n|S)P(S|X),w h i c h\nindicates how likely chord wis to follow context uof length\n649Oral Session 8: Chord Analysis\nn\n GT WB IKN MKN HPYLM\n VPYLM\n1\n 16.8 15.6 16.0 15.7 15.8 ( ¬±0.03)\n2\n 20.3 14.2 15.2 15.8 14.5 ( ¬±0.10)\nn: posterior sample\n3\n 23.5 15.4 16.0 16.3 16.0 ( ¬±0.18)\n 13.4 (¬±0.33)\n4\n 25.5 16.8 17.7 15.5 13.9 ( ¬±0.25)\n5\n 26.3 17.5 16.2 14.1 13.7 ( ¬±0.23)\n n: MAP estimate\n6\n 27.0 17.8 15.1 13.5 13.6 ( ¬±0.23)\n 12.9 (¬±0.35)\n7\n 27.3 18.0 14.5 13.3 13.6 ( ¬±0.23)\n8\n 27.3 18.0 14.2 13.2 13.6 ( ¬±0.22)\nn: marginalized out\n9\n 27.3 18.0 14.1 13.1 13.5 ( ¬±0.23)\n 11.9 (¬±0.22)\n10\n 27.3 18.0 14.0 13.1 13.5 ( ¬±0.23)\nTable 2 .

For example, C:7 F:7 C:7 is a typical blues-rock pat-\ntern that was popularized by the Beatles. We can see that the\nBeatles liked to use chord patterns including (major/minor)\nseventh chords, which were not so common at that time.\nIn the second experiment, VF-VPYLM, the vocabulary-\nfree inÔ¨Ånity-gram model, yielded a perplexity signiÔ¨Åcantly\nlower than the other models did (Table 4). The performance\nadvantage was larger than that in the Ô¨Årst experiment. Thisproves that our model is robust to the data sparseness (large-\nor inÔ¨Ånite-vocabulary situation).\n6. CONCLUSION\nWe presented a nonparametric Bayesian n-gram model for\nchord sequences that requires neither a vocabulary of chordtypes nor a predeÔ¨Ånition of n. We showed that it performed\nsigniÔ¨Åcantly better than the state-of-the-art models.\nThis study opens up a new research direction. We plan to\nlet computers acquire the concept of ‚Äúchords‚Äù in an unsuper-vised manner from a large amount of music scores and, ul-\ntimately, from a large amount of musical audio signals. We\nknow that certain combinations of notes can form chords. Is\nthis learned from experience? How reasonable is a deÔ¨Åni-\ntion of chords? To explore ways to answer this question we\nneed to consider an inÔ¨Ånite number of note combinations as\nchord candidates. Bayesian nonparametrics is a promisinggenerative approach to such kinds of meta-level problems.\nPu(w,n|X)\nStochastically-cohe rent chord pattern ( n‚â•3)\n0.701\n n=3:C : 7F : 7C : 7\n0.682\n n=3: B:maj F:maj G:maj\n0.656\n n=3: A:min C:7 F:maj\n0.647\n n=3: F:min G:maj C:maj\n0.645\n n=4: F:maj F:maj G:maj C:maj\n0.632\n n=3: E:min C:7 F:maj\n0.630\n n=3: C:maj7 D:min7 E:min7\n0.627\n n=4: B:maj F:maj G:maj C:maj\n0.622\n n=3: D:min7 G:sus4 G:maj\n0.620\n n=5: D:min G:maj C:maj F:maj C:maj\nTable 3 .

INTRODUCTION\nMusical timbre perception and its acoustical correlates have\nbeen a subject of research since the late 19th century [15].\nDuring the last decades numerous studies on musical timbre\nhave tried to uncover the number of signiÔ¨Åcant perceptual\ndimensions and their semantic associations. Having applied\ndifferent techniques most of these studies have concluded\nto either 3 or 4 major perceptual dimensions for modelling\ntimbres of monophonic acoustic instruments and have also\nproposed a wide range of verbal attributes to label them.\nGrey in his state-of-the-art study in 1977 proposed a 3-D\nspace for musical timbre representation by applying Mul-\ntidimensional Scaling techniques to pairwise dissimilarity\nrating data [3]. Krumhansl and McAdams have also pro-\nposed a 3-D space [8], [9] whose physical correlates vary\ncompared to the ones proposed by Grey.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for proÔ¨Åt or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the Ô¨Årst page.\nc/circlecopyrt2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.von Bismarck conducted a semantic differential listen-\ning test featuring 30 verbal scales in order to rate 35 speech\nsounds [14]. According to this study timbre would have\nfour orthogonal dimensions. One of the four von Bismarck‚Äôs\ndimensions is associated with volume ( full-empty ), another\none is a blend of vision and texture ( dull-sharp ), the third\nis labelled colourful-colourless and the last one is labelled\ncompact-diffused . Other related studies also revealed three\nor four perceptual axes. Pratt and Doak, working with sim-\nple synthetic tones have proposed a 3-D space featuring a vi-\nsion ( bright-dull ), a temperature ( warm-cold ) and a wealth\n(rich-pure ) axis [11]. ÀòStÀòep¬¥anek‚Äôs study in the Czech lan-\nguage [13] reveals one dimension associated with vision\n(gloomy-clear ), another one with texture ( harsh-delicate ),\na third one with volume ( full-narrow ) and a last one with\nhearing ( noisy/rustle-‚ÄòundeÔ¨Åned‚Äô ). Moravec‚Äôs work again in\nCzech language has also resulted to four perceptual axes re-\nlated to vision ( bright/clear-gloomy/dark ), texture ( hard/sharp-\ndelicate/soft ), volume ( wide-narrow ) and temperature ( hot/\nhearty - ‚ÄòundeÔ¨Åned‚Äô ) [10]. Finally, Howard‚Äôs study in the\nEnglish language [6] has uncovered four salient dimensions\nthe Ô¨Årst of which is a mixture of vision, texture, volume and\ntemperature ( bright/thin/harsh-dull/warm/gentle ). The sec-\nond one is labelled pure/percussive-nasal , the third is as-\nsociated with the material of the sound source ( metallic-\nwooden ) and the fourth is related to the evolution in time\n(evolving ).\nAlthough there seems to be some agreement concerning\nthe number and attributes of the timbre dimensions, some\ndifferences between studies do exist. Such inconsistencies\ncould be due to the different experimental protocol used\neach time and also due to generalization of the Ô¨Åndings that\nresulted from a particular ‚Äòsampling‚Äô of the vast timbre space.\nThus, the selection of an appropriate set of sounds that will\nrepresent as much of the variance of the existing musical\ntimbres as possible and at the same time will keep the dura-\ntion of a listening test relatively short is crucial. This work\naddressed this issue by including a wide range of musical\ntimbres with high ecological validity drawn from acoustic\n807Oral Session 10\ninstruments, electric instruments and synthesisers.\nAll of the cited studies have applied Factor Analysis and\nCluster Analysis techniques in order to achieve dimension\nreduction of their multidimensional perceptual data. Factor\nanalysis is a multivariate statistical technique that is used to\nuncover the latent structure of a set of inter-correlated vari-\nables [4]. It is widely applied in musical timbre research in\norder to reduce a large number of semantic descriptions to a\nsmaller number of interpretable factors. Cluster Analysis is\nanother statistical technique that seeks to identify homoge-\nneous subgroups within a larger set of observations [12]. In\nthe research on timbre perception it can indicate groups of\nsemantically related verbal descriptors.\nThe current work has also made use of these data analysis\ntechniques seeking for more deÔ¨Ånitive conclusions concern-\ning the nature of the signiÔ¨Åcant verbal descriptors of musical\ntimbre. Overall, it aims at yielding a content analysis frame-\nwork based on extramusical semantics.\n2. METHOD\nFor the purpose of this study a listening test exploiting a\nvariation of the Verbal Attribute Magnitude Estimation (V AME)\n[7] method was designed and conducted. The subjects were\nprovided with a pool of 30 Greek verbal descriptors and\nwere asked to describe timbral attributes of 23 sound stim-\nuli by choosing the adjectives they believed that were more\nappropriate for each case. Once a subject chose a descriptor\nhe was further asked to insert its amount of relevance on a\nscale anchored by the verbal attribute and its negation, such\nas ‚Äú not brilliant - very brilliant‚Äù. This rating was performed\nby a horizontal slider with a hidden continuous scale rang-\ning from 0 to 100. The verbal descriptors used, were En-\nglish language equivalents that are commonly found in tim-\nbre perception literature [1], [14], [2], [5] and are depicted\nin Table 1. The subjects were also free to insert up to three\nadjectives of their own choice for describing each stimuli in\ncase they felt that the provided terms were inadequate.\n2.1 Stimuli - Material\nA set of 23 sounds of high ecological validity (acoustic in-\nstruments, electric instruments and state-of-the-art synthe-\nsisers) was selected. The following 14 instrument tones\ncome from the MUMS (McGill University Master Samples)\nlibrary: violin, sitar, trumpet, clarinet, piano at A3 (220 Hz),\ndouble bass pizzicato, Les Paul Gibson guitar, baritone sax-\nophone B Ô¨Çat at A2 (110 Hz), oboe at A4 (440 Hz), Gib-\nson guitar, pipe organ, marimba, harpsichord at G3 (196\nHz) and french horn at A3# (233 Hz). A Ô¨Çute recording at\nA4 was also used along with a set of 8 synthesiser sounds:\nAcid, Hammond, Moog, Rhodes piano at A2, electric piano\n(rhodes), Wurltitzer, FarÔ¨Åsa at A3 and Bowedpad at A4. The\nsamples were loudness equalised with an informal listeningtest within the research team. The playback level was set\nbetween 65 and 75 A weighted dB SPL rms. 83% of the\nsubjects found that level comfortable and 78% reported that\nloudness was perceived as being constant across stimuli.\nThe listening test was conducted in an acoustically iso-\nlated listening room. Sound stimuli were presented through\nthe use of a desktop computer (Intel pentium 2.8 GHz, 1 GB\nRam, WinXP(SP3)), with an M-Audio (Firewire 410) exter-\nnal audio interface, and a pair of Sennheiser HD60 ovation\ncircumaural headphones. The interface of the experiment\nwas built in Max/MSP.\n2.2 Listening Panel\nForty one subjects (aged 19-55, mean age 23.3, 13 male)\nparticipated in the listening test. None of them reported any\nhearing loss and all of them were critical listeners and had\nbeen practising music for 13.5 years on average (ranging\nfrom 5 to 35). The majority of subjects were students at the\nDepartment of Music Studies of the Aristotle University of\nThessaloniki. Course credit was offered as a reward for their\nparticipation.\n2.3 Procedure\nInitially the listeners were presented with a familiarisation\nstage which consisted of the random presentation of the stim-\nuli set in order for them to get a feel of the timbral range\nof the experiment. For the main part of the experiment\nthe playback of each sound was allowed as many times as\nneeded prior to submitting a rating. The sounds were pre-\nsented in a random order for each listener in order to min-\nimize bias to the responses. Subjects were advised to use\nas many of the terms as they felt were necessary for an ac-\ncurate description of each different timbre and also to take\na break in case they felt signs of fatigue. They were also\nfree to withdraw at any point. The overall listening test pro-\ncedure, including instructions, lasted around 40 minutes for\nthe majority of the subjects. The wide majority of subjects\nrated the above procedure as easy to follow, clear and mean-\ningful.\n2.4 Factor Analysis\nAlthough the choice between Exploratory Factor Analysis\n(FA) or Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for data re-\nduction has long been debated, we believe that FA is the\nappropriate choice for our investigation, as we focus on the\nidentiÔ¨Åcation of potential underlying structures that shall de-\nscribe and justify the semantic representation of listeners‚Äô\ntimbral experiences and judgements, across different musi-\ncal sounds.\nThe basic FA model is described as:\n80812th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nzj=aj1F1+aj2F2+. . .+ajnFn+Uj=n/summationdisplay\ni=1ajiFi+Uj\n(1)\nwhere j= 1. . . m or in matrix notation,\nZ = A¬∑F + U (2)\nwhere\nZT=/bracketleftbig\nz1¬∑¬∑¬∑zm/bracketrightbig\nis the array of manalysed variables\nA=Ô£Æ\nÔ£ØÔ£∞a11¬∑¬∑¬∑ a1n\n.........\nam1¬∑¬∑¬∑amnÔ£π\nÔ£∫Ô£ª\nis the matrix of factor loadings to be estimated from the\ndata,\nFT=/bracketleftbig\nF1¬∑¬∑¬∑Fn/bracketrightbig\nis the array of n Common Factors , and\nUT=/bracketleftbig\nU1¬∑¬∑¬∑Um/bracketrightbig\nis the array of m Unique Factors .\nActually, the problem and methodology of FA is to try\nto create, from a set of original variables, a new set of con-\nstructs (the common factors, with n <m) that will com-\npactly describe the correlations between the original vari-\nables. Unique factors add to the versatility of the solution,\nas they account for that part of the original variance that\ncannot be attributed or modelled by the common factors.\n3. RESULTS\nThe listeners‚Äô responses were analysed employing Cluster\nAnalysis and Factor Analysis (FA). For this reason the quan-\ntity estimations on each verbal descriptor and each musical\ntimbre were averaged over the 41 subjects of the test. Basic\nstatistics for each descriptor are shown in Table 1.\nOnly 37% of the subjects inserted at least one extra ver-\nbal descriptor thus providing 36 additional terms. However,\nonly 9 of them where mentioned more than once and only 4\nwere mentioned by more than one subject. This sparsity and\ninconsistency of the Ô¨Åndings implies that our proposed set\nof 30 adjectives was adequate for describing this particular\nset of musical timbres.\nAs the distributions for most descriptors showed exces-\nsive positive skewness, a square root monotonic transforma-\ntion was applied. Initially, the terms empty, distinct, nasal\nwere removed following a bivariate correlation analysis over\nthe 30 descriptors that was employed to identify and removeTable 1 .

A cen-\ntroid Hierarchical Cluster Analysis based on squared Eu-\nclidean distances over the remaining 27 descriptors (Figure\n1) identiÔ¨Åed 3 major clusters of descriptors, namely Clus-\nter 1: soft, light, warm, smooth, rounded, dull, rich, full,\nthick, deep, dense, dark, compact, hollow, Cluster 2: bright,\nbrilliant, thin, clear, Cluster 3: shrill, sharp, rough, harsh,\ndirty, messy, dry, cold, metallic. In order to further reduce\nthe number of verbal descriptors, a preliminary Factor Anal-\nysis was performed within each cluster and those with abso-\nlute factor loadings1>0.7 were selected for the subsequent\nÔ¨Ånal Factor Analysis.\nFor each cluster FA, Maximum Likelihood (ML) factor\nextraction with Oblimin rotation was employed. Maximum\nLikelihood estimation of factor loadings allows for sufÔ¨Å-\ncient, consistent and efÔ¨Åcient representation of the FA‚Äôs pat-\ntern matrix, under the provision of multivariate normality of\nthe data, a condition for which special steps have been taken\nin this work (e.g. variable transformation).Traditionally, FA\nresults in a reduced size description of correlations between\nthe subjected variables using new ‚Äòcombined‚Äô variables (the\nfactors) which are designed and computed as mutually or-\nthogonal. However, in several cases, orthogonality of fac-\ntors could impede the interpretability of results by consti-\ntuting an unexpectedly strict and excluding possibility. We\nbelieve that in this work we should relax the factors‚Äô or-\n1Factor loadings are the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between variables and\nfactors. The values of the factor loadings indicate how well a certain vari-\nable is represented by a particular factor and are crucial for the labelling\nand interpretation of the factors.\n809Oral Session 10\nFigure 1 .

Later on, as it is usually\npreferred, it will be possible to check and justify the neces-\nsity for such a divergence from orthogonality requirements,\nby considering inter-factor correlations. The Direct Oblimin\nmethod (among others) is considered as a viable approach to\nthe problem of oblique factor rotation.\nPrincipal components extraction was used prior to fac-\ntor extraction in order to determine the number of factors\nand ensure absence of multicollinearity. The Kaiser-Meyer-\nOlkin (KMO)2measure of sampling adequacy was for all\nthree clusters bigger than 0.6 (Cluster 1: 0.672, Cluster2:\n0.69, Cluster 3: 0.76), and the Bartlett‚Äôs test of spheric-\nity3also showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. For each clus-\nter, the Ô¨Årst 3 factors were decided to be retained from the\ninitial eigenvalues and the scree plots, accounting for more\nthan 79% of cumulative variance. After factor extraction,\nthe selected factors based on communalities4bigger than\n2The KMO assesses the sample size (i.e. cases/variables) and predicts\nif data are likely to factor well based on correlation and partial correlation.\nThe KMO can be calculated for individual and multiple variables. KMO\nvaries from 0 to 1.0 and KMO overall should be .60 or higher to proceed\nwith factor analysis.\n3Bartlett‚Äôs test concerns whether correlations between variables are\noverall signiÔ¨Åcantly different from zero.\n4The communality measures the percent of variance in a given variable0.6 were: Cluster 1: soft, light, warm, smooth, rounded,\nrich, full, thick, deep, dense , Cluster 3: shrill, sharp, rough,\nharsh, dirty, messy, dry . However, for the second cluster, a\n3-factor solution could not be obtained and we decided to\nreduce the number of factors to 1, leading to retained de-\nscriptors as Cluster 2: bright, brilliant . In all 3 cases all\neigenvalues were >0.014, avoiding singularity.\nThe descriptors selected in the preliminary stage were\nthen subjected to a Ô¨Ånal FA, again using ML and Oblimin\nrotation. The KMO measure was 0.654 and the Bartletts test\nof sphericity also showed statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. Although\nsingularity was again avoided, extreme multicollinearity was\npresent leading to removal of ‚Äòculprit‚Äô descriptors. Next, the\nFA was repeated with a reduced set of 15 remaining descrip-\ntors. Again, 3 factors were extracted, accounting for more\nthan 85% of initial variance. Although only messy and dirty\nhad extracted communality <0.6, for reasons of parsimony\nwe additionally posed a criterion of absolute factor loading\n>0.75 as a Ô¨Ånal step to data reduction. Maximum corre-\nlation between rotated factors was 0.249. The prominent\ndescriptors over the three factors are shown in Table 2. Fac-\ntor scores coefÔ¨Åcients are given in Table 3. Multiplied by a\nsample‚Äôs standardized measured score on the corresponding\nvariables, these coefÔ¨Åcients will sum to the score of a given\nsample on a given factor.\nTable 2 .

A high factor loading in-\ndicates that a particular variable is expressed strongly by a\ncertain factor. Based on Table 2, the three factors could be\nidentiÔ¨Åed as Factor 1 volume/wealth , Factor 2 brightness\nanddensity , and Factor 3 texture andtemperature(warmth) .\nThus, it would seem possible to address musical timbre with\nsemantic associations to material objects properties. It also\nseems, based on indications from the extracted variances,\nand since the oblique rotation results in relatively low levels\nexplained by all the factors jointly.\n81012th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2011)\nTable 3 .

Figures 3 and\n4 reveal a noticeable inÔ¨Çuence of fundamental frequency on\nthe brightness axis, as higher pitched sounds tend to be rated\nas brighter than lower pitched ones. A potential similar in-\nÔ¨Çuence on the other two axis cannot be supported by these\ndepictions.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThe above Ô¨Åndings share many things in common with re-\nsults of previous studies -as presented in the introduction-\nboth on the number and on the attributes of the uncovered\ntimbre space dimensions. Indeed, volume ,wealth ,texture ,\ntemperature andvision related terms have also been attributed\nas labels to timbre space dimensions from previous research.\nFurthermore, most of the past studies result in perceptual\nspaces of either three or four dimensions for musical timbre\nrepresentation. This agreement is present even among stud-\nies that apply different experimental protocols and methods\nfor the creation of timbre spaces such as Multidimensional\nScaling on data from pairwise dissimilarity listening tests\nor Principal Component Analysis for dimension reduction\namong perceptual variables. It is important, however, to\nemphasize the fact that the Factor Analysis applied on the\nvariables (i.e adjectives) of this experiment was based on\nstrictly mathematical criteria avoiding any bias from paststudies results.\nOne other important outcome of the current work is that\ninter-dimension correlation is low. Consequently, even though\nthe orthogonality requirement was not initially followed, as\nin most previous works, the result is still a nearly orthogonal\nspace with independent dimensions.\nA conÔ¨Årmatory study for examining the adequacy of the\nextracted perceptual dimensions regarding timbre descrip-\ntion will be the next step for reaching the desired content\nanalysis framework. The deÔ¨Ånition of such a framework\nwill contribute towards a better understanding of musical\ntimbre and can be used for the development of perceptual\ndriven applications on musical sound modiÔ¨Åcation and syn-\nthesis.\nFinally, this study also positively adds to the concept of\ninter-linguistic agreement regarding musical timbre verbal-\nization and proposes a certain rationale for the interpretation\nof the salient musical timbre space dimensions. The notion\nof timbre perception as being projected on other less abstract\nsenses in order to facilitate expression and communication\ncould in a sense justify the inter-linguistic agreement. The\norientation of the human mind towards decoding and cate-\ngorizing all incoming information to familiar entities could\nbe responsible for the semantic associations to material ob-\njects that were revealed in this study.\nFigure 2 . V olume/Wealth vs Texture/Temperature\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have conducted an initial exploration of the\npossible underlying semantic structure of adjective timbral\ndescriptors for musical sounds. Factor and Cluster Analy-\nsis applied on the subjective evaluation responses revealed\n811Oral Session 10\nFigure 3 . Brightness-Density vs V olume/Wealth.\nthree perceptual dimensions with high degree of indepen-\ndence that explained over 80% of the total variance. These\ndimensions are associated with material object properties\nsuch as volume ,brightness-density andtexture-temperature\nand constitute a framework for the semantic description of\nthis particular set of sound stimuli. A further challenging\nissue is the conduction of conÔ¨Årmatory structural analysis\n(e.g. ConÔ¨Årmatory Factor Analysis) along different groups\nof sounds and/or different groups of listeners, since all aes-\nthetic, stylistic and cultural factors could possibly affect the\nvalidity of the hereby developed semantic model. Subse-\nquently, such a developed semantic framework could be de-\nployed in a semantically driven framework of audio signal\nprocessing with application in musical sound synthesis, au-\ndio post-production or other similar Ô¨Åelds.\n6.
